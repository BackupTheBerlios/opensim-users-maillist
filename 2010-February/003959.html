&gt;&gt;<i> 3. Is there a gui interface to run the OpenSim mangement console from a

We were just yesterday brainstorming and planning how to do that kind of 
interface as a part of realXtend work, not for OARs or IARs though but 
for the .scene (dotscene) xml format we use to export from 3d apps like 
Blender and Max. The logistics with the transfer of the tarball/zip and 
commanding the Opensim server from the GUI are identical, though, just 
the xml etc. inside is different.

The main need is to allow modellers and level designers etc. to upload 
scenes (or parts of them) remotely to the server, without needing access 
to the system nor having to know how to use the console. This is how it 
works with the console now,

&gt;<i> remote admin interface similar to the existing ones for loading and saving oars remotely.  Then a gui could hook into that.

</I>
Our current candidate solution is to make a REST handler to OpenSim 
which accepts the scene+assets bundle over http, and runs the 
import/load command that nowdays is given from the console. Possibly 
that same http listener will also implement a web (html) gui for doing 
that. Another GUI options we have is writing one to the Naali viewer 
itself (using qt, instead of html), and we'll probably at some point 
also integrate the http scene upload to Blender so that it can send it 
to Opensim directly.

An interesting idea is to put the imported scene as an asset to the 
inventory. That is, if you have already imported some scenes / loaded 
some OARs earlier, they show in your inv, and you can apply them from 
there (kind of like rezzing linksets). We will probably do this for 
.scene, dunno if the idea would apply for OARs as well.

This is not terribly urgent for us, 'cause right now the building works 
progress by the modellers just using local sandboxes where managing the 
files is easy and no harm can be done accidentally to production 
servers. But probably we want this sooner than later to ease remote 
uploads, possible implement already next week or so (after some planning 
first still).

So if we do that, will at least give some info for vanilla Opensim usage 
too about how http uploads / rest commands work for this etc., and 
possibly some code that also OAR/IAR uploading can reuse.

We are not using OAR for this 'cause the format is much more complex 
than the very simple .scene xml which works for just the visual parts of 
the scene (models, their pos&amp;rot&amp;scales, and materials), and .scene 
exporters already existed for most modelling apps. OAR is a 
autoserialized .NET dump of OpenSim internal data structures, so not the 
easiest to support in other applications, and if we'd write support for 
it by hand, it would break always when OpenSim internal structures 
change. OAR is of course very useful for saving all the OpenSim data for 
transfers and backups, just not easiest for interop with other 
applications. Whether these two use cases could be somehow unified to 
use the same format is another discussion (and on a -dev forum to not 
bore users :), just wanted to mention here why we don't use OAR for this 
now.
