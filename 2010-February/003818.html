Theres things to think about here. If your just running a small amout of
regions you prob wount see mutch of a differance. On the other hand having
mysql on its own dedicated server allows more ram free to the region
servers, far less stress on the processor as thats handled by the other box.
U have allways run my servers in that way. The down side is your adding in
latency as your having togo accrost lan type connections that can actualy
make things slower.  In my case we run many servers and it was the best
balance possable given the amount of data ect. Another resion you may way to
consider it, is your ini for all your instances will be the same connection
string (makes changing things alot easyer). It also tends to add a tad bit
more security as your not exposing the Mysql server to the outside world and
it dosent exist on the same servers that have tobe exposed.
I found it qute flexable and stable no matter what we throw at it. The other
thing is main tasks are also sep. from the server running the regions. It
can now have its own set of events that dont bother mutch.
Its not hard to set it up like that but you do have to install mysql to
allow remote lan connections.
Other things i found was we needed mysql replication because our data base
became so large that it was an all day thing to deal with. Alot of this most
wount need for along time. It took well over a year to get to a point where
it all mattered. 
MySql eats memory and adds to the overhead of the cpu and i/o. 
If you have the equipment and plan on expanding over time, its prob a good
idea to set it up like that now.
If you never plan on more than a few regions you prob dont need to set it up
like that.
