<PRE>
After a week of hard testing this i found an odd thing. That would be
incasistant loading of the all the sector assets. Orginaly when i loaded
this moster i got use to seeing the errors of prim crossing boundrys. And
that mes. is actauly correct for debug to report. Now when it loads that way
everything remains fine. All prims in there place and scripts running. But
thats not allways the message now, Ill get rather odd ones in there place
using json and something i dont quite understand. When i see anything but
the Object crossing error, i find not just all the prims dident load but
also high internet looping. 
At 1st i thought Packets or latency. I am after all pushing this hard. So i
spent alot of time trying this and that. Many times it looked like i had
found a soultion but later found it dident matter. I checked mysql region
data, i checked and checked. All the stuff is fine, just not allways
loading!.
I remeber a kind sole submiting a mantis about something like this and there
suggestion but still find it loads with the same Huh to it. At this point i
have no aswer to it. I do know thats not the only effect when the instance
fails to load. BTW when i say fail i dont mean the instance diddent run, it
runs if it loaded everything or not.
It cannot be conf because it remains the same. I flushed all cache's and
temp data same &quot;works sometimes fine many times not&quot;. Client error? I dont
think so. i got use to that too. 
The message on instance load is totaly diff. to the point i know if its
loading right or not.
To go further knowing im pushing this alot as far as yah get. Tryed a simple
2x2 mega. I made sandboxes in the same way just not as big. It has just a
few k prims and other than tele-hub nothing fancy.
It loads right all the time. The kicker is the 2x2 loads using exactly same
box and in fact all i did was change the regions ini out, not any settings.
I did try hard to offer a workaround but in days of trying im stumped! The
problem why i add this here is its intermittant and needs others to take a
look too.
