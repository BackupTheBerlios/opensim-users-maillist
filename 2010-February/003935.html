<PRE>I created an account on OSGrid back in November of 2007.

     These days I spend an enormous amount of time there with some of my
publicly accessible regions.

     Yesterday I relocated one of my homestead regions and where I put it
was next to about 5 &quot;pirate/island&quot; themed sims/regions.

     Being nosy, I flew around my neighboring regions.  And lo and behold I
found and extraordinary collection of palm trees swaying in the breeze and
luxurious tropical plants as far as my eyes could see.  And yet, this entire
world seemed a bit more than faintly familiar...

     Upon closer inspection, every single palm tree, bush, shrub, grass,
tree, and water lily bore a certain extreme recognizability...

     I wonder if Lilith Heart, who has made her fortune selling an endless
variety of absolutely beautiful plants in Second Life knows that her years
of devoted and hard work have been cleanly ripped and presented all over
OSGrid?  And in what probably amounted to a couple hours of image ripping
and XML exporting...

     Sadly, there's not a single thing she can do.  Which is why, though I
happily imported my entire furniture and building collection into OpenSim,
not a single piece of it is (yet) available to the general public on
OSGrid.  I eventually plan to make it all available, but the simple fact is,
when I do, it will immediately be ripped to shreds and will be found spread
out all over the grid.  Not such a bad thing to one degree since the
furniture is all very highly detailed, but it will surely put a very
resoundingly obvious period at the end of my virtual business endeavors.  In
other words, I don't see a penny from it.
