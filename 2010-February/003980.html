<PRE>Unfortunately, what you propose is still utterly impossible to put into
practice.  This is one of those few times when a person can say with
absolute certainty there will NEVER be a way one will be capable of fully
securing their virtual creations.

In a perfect (Apple/Mac) world, all hardware and software originates from a
single exclusive source.  In said perfect world such things can be tightly
controlled and moderated.

</I>&gt;<i> It's like all the copyguards surrounding video.  they all work well and

</I>&gt;<i> One of the easiest, fastest and most sure-fire ways to &quot;steal&quot; a new movie
</I>&gt;<i> in the theaters is by simply using a video camera in the theater to record
</I>&gt;<i> the video as it plays on-screen.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With virtual worlds, the fact that everything must ultimately be rendered
</I>&gt;<i> so
</I>&gt;<i> that we can see and enjoy it, also means that circumventions can easily
</I>&gt;<i> exist to exploit the rendering and thus be &quot;recorded&quot; and saved by an
</I>&gt;<i> unscrupulous pirate who can then do whatever they wish with the end result.

</I>&gt;<i> Well i think its more a matter of making it less attractive for someone to
</I>&gt;<i> do mostly. If there is no use for stolen stuff because the system wount let
</I>&gt;<i> it be imported or exported is part of it. The other would be a type of
</I>&gt;<i> water
</I>&gt;<i> mark in it to. Why i agree most all of that wount stop it, it could at
</I>&gt;<i> least
</I>&gt;<i> leave a verry bad taste in there mouth. Most users are verry cool and dont
</I>&gt;<i> want problems from anyone and tend to do the right things. As it is were
</I>&gt;<i> not
</I>&gt;<i> really trying at all and i think anything is better than nothing.

</I>&gt;<i> We dont have to make it easy or attrative for the bad guys though. :-)
