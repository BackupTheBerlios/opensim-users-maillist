I love it - don't we all do that though? LOL

To me, one of the problems with the Linden Labs architecture is that everything is so very much dependant on the viewer. It certainly makes sense from a server/client perspective, but from a simulation perspective it sucks! The rendering inconsistencies are only one of the problems. Sigh.

I first ran across &quot;sculpties&quot; as NURBS, either on Poser or 3DS Max. They make a lot more sense with that implementation! In essence they were intended to model organic type structures which are inherently &quot;squishy&quot; in nature. They do that job very well, and even the strange morphs due to viewer problems do not violate the believability in an &quot;organic&quot; type of object like a pillow.

I agree that the SL &quot;sculpties&quot; have been sadly mis-used as a short cut to produce complex shapes of all kinds. 

A window frame is just a mess as a sculptie! That kind of kludge will certainly run into some nasty problems later (far worse than we see now!) since they are now solidly built into the structure of the Sl environment for better or for worse!

Probably it would be much better to model that kind of object with a texture somehow - textures at least seem to work quite well.

I am looking forward to the incorporation of the RealXtend handling of actual mesh objects into OpenSim though. A mesh really does model most real world objects quite closely.

Obviously the more closely your model conforms to what you are depicting then the better your depiction - if only because the &quot;kludges&quot; necessary to make things work are minimised.

Still we have what we have for all its shortcomings.

Anyway thanks for enlightening me. I am not as passionate about it as you, but I certainly agree that &quot;sculpties&quot; are mis-used in SL and OpenSim!

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A similar feeling comes over me when I either approach

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But a sculpted flagpole and flag seems like a massive mess

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've always had a strong fondness for
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; expressing my creativity in a 3D representation.&#160; I
</I>&gt;<i> was
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; lucky enough to find a platform with Second Life where
</I>&gt;<i> I
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; could also see a profit from my interest.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But like with the recording industry, change is
</I>&gt;<i> inevitable
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in the platform and as must likewise learn to adapt.&#160;
</I>&gt;<i> I
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; believe the most difficult thing to overcome is the
</I>&gt;<i> natural
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tendency toward stagnation of reason.&#160; I want things
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; remain the same because that is what I'm most
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; comfortable with.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Second Life of yesteryear is not the Second Life of
</I>&gt;<i> today,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and the same is true of OpenSim.&#160; For example,
</I>&gt;<i> I'm so
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; opposed to the use of sculpties it's almost
</I>&gt;<i> evangelical
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in nature.&#160; I absolutely detest them in any
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;shape,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; form or fashion.&quot;&#160; But that is because I'm
</I>&gt;<i> old
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; school.&#160; I 'cut my teeth' learning 3D
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; virtualization when the basic prim and its derivatives
</I>&gt;<i> were
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; all you had to work with, so creatively working with
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; medium was all I had.&#160; Now one can create a
</I>&gt;<i> limitless
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; assortment of items simply by the use of sculpties.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But if I can learn to accommodate sculpt maps into my
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; virtual life, then surely I can accommodate other
</I>&gt;<i> changes,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; including a new business model surrounding my
