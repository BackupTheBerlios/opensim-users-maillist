<PRE>Ok.. I have an idea..  not sure how possible this is..  so this is a long
shot....  I know in SL you can create a script that gets the persons UUID.
That ID in turn can be used in conjunction with your items and in SL it is
what safe guards your inventory to a small degree.  It also shows who the
creator and owner is. Now these guys who upload the content, they get it and
attempt to upload to OSG for example. Now what if on the website OSG had a
way to create the user with the UUID from SL, IF they are using a name from
SL. In turn the UUID would store that users UUID in the &quot;new&quot; database that
would be the same one from SL. Now..  for the sake of argument, there would
be a check mark you as a newbie can click to show your using a name from SL.
 Now if that person who did not check mark that cannot upload content
already made. ( accept textures and sounds which there is NO WAY to
safeguard against. But all other content will have been made from a grid
other then OSG can show this. If the content from OSG is made then another
type of perms is set so that you must have a UUID attached on each file if
you want to re-upload it..

Maybe I am saying it wrong and I know i'm exhaustedly tired right now.  But
can anyone get an idea of what i'm saying here ?
