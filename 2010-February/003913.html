<PRE>Just following up...

IAR appears to work as advertised :-)


I had stored the sample my-great-items.iar in a poor location...moved  
it to the &quot;bin&quot; directory in the Diva installation, and it uploaded  
correctly.  Still interested if others have better ways to save assets  
off development sims, but it seems being able to save items in IAR  
files could be the solution :-)

Thank you!

</I>&gt;<i> I just started at looking at OpenSim and managed to get the &quot;Diva&quot;

</I>&gt;<i> etc. etc.  by just sharing the VirtualBox applicance on  
</I>&gt;<i> DVD.   ...Everything preconfigured and ready to go. I actually  
</I>&gt;<i> tested this out with my son (9th grader) and he was able to pick it  
</I>&gt;<i> up pretty quick.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here's my question. If I have multiple people developing the content  
</I>&gt;<i> for a &quot;pre-packaged&quot; OpenSim curriculum, what is the easiest way to  
</I>&gt;<i> collect these assets, centralize them, and then load them up into  
</I>&gt;<i> and target sim for sharing?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -I have looked at the SecondInventory product. It looks like a  
</I>&gt;<i> possible solution, but not sure if it would work with multiple  
</I>&gt;<i> students and teachers saving to a common repository?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -I also looked at the short section on IAR files. This appears to be  
</I>&gt;<i> a good way to archive and save out individual build items, houses,  
</I>&gt;<i> furniture, etc. etc. I was thinking this would be better than  
</I>&gt;<i> SecondInventory, however I must not be using it correctly. Here's  
</I>&gt;<i> what I did:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Downloaded the sample iar file from the OpenSim site. (my-great- 
</I>&gt;<i> items.iar)
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Moved the iar sample into the documents folder on my server
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Used the following command:  load iar Dr. Klink Documents/my- 
</I>&gt;<i> great-items.iar IAR-Additions/ mySuperSecretPassword
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is what I get:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [Inventory Archiver]: PLEASE NOT THAT THIS FACILITY IS EXPERIMENTAL.  
</I>&gt;<i> BUG REPORTS WELCOME.
</I>&gt;<i> [Inventory Archiver]: Loading archive mySyoerSecretPassword to  
</I>&gt;<i> inventory path Documents/my-great-items.iar for Dr. Klink
</I>&gt;<i> [Inventory Archiver]: Password for user Dr. Klink incorrect. Please  
</I>&gt;<i> try again.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The second line seems a little strange. Is it supposed to report  
</I>&gt;<i> back the avatar password there?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, if there is a better way to save build assets off the OpenSim,  
</I>&gt;<i> I'd be much appreciative!
</I>&gt;<i>
