<PRE>I am having trouble with uploading animations, textures, sounds, etc to OpenSim when running it under Windows.
About a third to half of the time I upload anything to OpenSim, it takes a few seconds longer than usual to upload
the data (especially noticable when performing a bulk upload of said data). That in itself isn't too worrisome to me,
but, if I log off OpenSim, shut the server down using the 'quit' command and restart it, and log back into OpenSim,
the data that I uploaded appears to be gone. The inventory objects referring to the data appears to still be in inventory,
but the data that it refers to on the asset server seems to be null and void.

For instance, if I uploaded a few (say 10 to 20) textures with the bulk import command, log off, shut down and restart the server, and log back in;
I can still see that the textures I uploaded are still apparently in my inventory, but if I try to open them to view the textures, all
it gives me is a blank white texture that is 256x256 in size. Same goes for animations and sounds that don't appear to upload
correctly; except the animations won't play and the sounds won't play if it was a &quot;bad&quot; upload. I've tried clearing my viewer cache and relogging,
but the data is still gone.

I can tell it will be a bad upload when using bulk because it takes quite a few seconds longer per file to upload than usual.
The server output seems to be normal in that it is acknowledging that it is receiving the uploaded data... But the persistance of
it seems to be gone about a third to half of the time I upload data. I can access the data that was uploaded perfectly fine... as long as I
do not log off and/or restart the server. Other times the data will persist fine between logging and/or restarting the server (this is characterized
by the data uploading at a quick and steady pace rather than hesitating between each upload).

I've double checked my MySQL, OpenSim.ini, and also my Cenome Cache settings, every thing seems to be in working order.
I am using the same settings in the server I run on Linux32 with Mono and uploads do not exhibit this strange behaviour with Linux.
Have not changed any settings in MySQL except for the Max Packet Size which I changed from 1 MB to 16 MB to allow database
backup and restore.

Specs for my Windows OS installation:
OpenSim git revision r12198 (have tried others as well) on .NET Framework 
Windows 7 32-Bit
2.5 GB Ram
AMD Athlon Dual Core @ 1.6 Ghz
MySQL 5.1 for database

Any help or insight would be greatly appreciated!
