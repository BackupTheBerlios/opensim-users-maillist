<PRE>Karen,

When I fist started seeing sculpties I was impressed.  The rounded edges on
cushions, the ability to render fully complex tlattices and window frames
with only a single prim, etc.

But I felt a feeling I can only describe as &quot;nausea&quot; the first few times I
came upon something and watched its twisted, contorted and violently
mis-shapen form gradually snap into shape as the sculptmaps rezzed and the
sculpties themselves take their final form.

A similar feeling comes over me when I either approach something comprised
of sculpts, or back away from something comprised of them.  The way they
kind of snap in and out of shape, distorting and forming depending on my
distance and Internet connection just makes me feel ill.

On the other hand, when I walk into a shop that containes objects of the
same degree of complexity, but that render instantaneously as a series of
individual prims, I just get this relaxing and calm feeling that &quot;life has
rendered beautifully&quot; once again.

Like I said, it's a personal thing and I don't expect anyone to understand
it fully.  It just seems very VERY unnatural for me in a virtual world to
have sculpted items when the core nature of the world is all a matter of
X-Y-Z coordinates and clean-cut numerical values to everything.

A prim-based flagpole and flag, for example, to me is a mathematical thing
of beauty, even as the flag sways in the breeze, it's the result of pure
numbers.

But a sculpted flagpole and flag seems like a massive mess of numbers all
tangled together and disorganized, trying to make sense but never being
quite capable.

I hope that helps a little bit.  :)

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've always had a strong fondness for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; expressing my creativity in a 3D representation.  I was
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; lucky enough to find a platform with Second Life where I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; could also see a profit from my interest.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But like with the recording industry, change is inevitable
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in the platform and as must likewise learn to adapt.  I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; believe the most difficult thing to overcome is the natural
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tendency toward stagnation of reason.  I want things to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; remain the same because that is what I'm most
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; comfortable with.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Second Life of yesteryear is not the Second Life of today,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and the same is true of OpenSim.  For example, I'm so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; opposed to the use of sculpties it's almost evangelical
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in nature.  I absolutely detest them in any &quot;shape,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; form or fashion.&quot;  But that is because I'm old
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; school.  I 'cut my teeth' learning 3D
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; virtualization when the basic prim and its derivatives were
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; all you had to work with, so creatively working with that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; medium was all I had.  Now one can create a limitless
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; assortment of items simply by the use of sculpties.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But if I can learn to accommodate sculpt maps into my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; virtual life, then surely I can accommodate other changes,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; including a new business model surrounding my passion.
