<PRE>
Well theres another problem too. When Opensim droped currency our users
started getting an 'Oh well why bother doing anything then!' and content
production got very lazy. The other thing that i think can cause this, is a
situation of 'When everything is free'. When i worked out a type of a reward
system, ppl were again productive and remain so today. Users spend alot of
time making there art for many reisons and if everything is free i feel
thats just as bad.

What i have done is to not allow HG or other regions to attach to the
servers. This is just part of the extra problem in opensimulator on top of
the ones there already are. We made shure that the reward system has 'No
Value' out side of it.
 
What would further some protections would be IF any content imported or made
by a user, the system would auto Water Mark. This mark could then be used to
ID the content as to its origin and user.
It would need to be something easly found with in the content.
This would have to be done on the serverside of corse. 
I feel that many tools could be made that check for it, and can be proactive
per server. 
Perhapes it wount stop rip off's but it shure would put a 'hitch in there
giddy-up's'.

I know this is theroy on my part and i dont like to do that mutch.

BTW: watermarks are used mostly by paint programs so artwork can be somewhat
trackable and removal impossable. 

I mostly feel that Opensimulator has the hindsight of SL and something like
this would be yet another +.
At least we can make it alot harder for them to take things that arnt theres
to have i think.
B-)

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> For some reason I have never really been able to agree with this
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> particular point of view.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Photographers, writers, music, radio, television and movie producers
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> have all been subject to people copying their content, using it in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ways they never intended, giving free copies away, selling duplicates,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> or even plagiarizing, often without the original creator getting
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> credit.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Yet for some reason when someone fails at any of the businesses
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> associated with these types of products, the fact that their
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> intellectual property can (and will be) illegally copied, is rarely
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> cited as the primary reason for failure to be profitable, become well
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> known, or help out your fellow man (depending on your original goals.)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> With proper marketing making it easy for people to find you, with good
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> pricing so that your competitive, with support that makes it clear
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> it's better to use your direct products rather than knock offs or
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> copies, with continued innovation of new products and services it is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> possible to not only make a profit, but to make a living producing
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> material than can (and will be) stolen.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, I'll admit there are many out there that wish they could
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> create/invent a handful of items and through the patent, copyright, or
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> trademark laws be able to sell their creation without the associated
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> business costs of dealing with copy cats and thieves, so that they can
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> make profit from their intellectual property in perpetuity.  But the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> simple fact of the matter is, that type of business climate started
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> slipping away in the 40's and is increasingly difficult to achieve.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Especially in a digital market place, where it is relatively easy for
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> your IP to be stolen.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> For me it's not really so much &quot;if you don't mind your stuff getting
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> stolen&quot; -- I don't really think anyone likes to have their stuff
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> stolen.  For me it's more about recognizing the market place, and the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> requirements and repercussions of doing business in that market, and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> making an informed decision to compete or not.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> On a personal note, I think a lot of the artists could make quite a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> bit of additional profit bylicensing their textures and creations via
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> a normal web site, using paypal, that does not directly target SL or
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> any particular Grid.  I have for example, tracked down an artist that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> sells textures via TRU (who has a strict no non-SL policy), and found
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that the artist licensing their own textures via the web for use
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> *anywhere* and doesn't even mention SL on their website.  The web site
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> happens to directly mention Poser/Daz3D, game and 3D content
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> developers.  I was more than willing to pay $30/USD to buy their
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> texture pack outside SL, and as per the terms of the license I can use
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> those anywhere (including in SL or OSGrid) as long as I don't
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> redistribute them as a texture pack -- I'm free to use them on my own
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> creations, even if I'm selling them.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Cheers,
