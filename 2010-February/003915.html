</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Due to SQLite connection management constraints, the authorization data

</I>&gt;<i> Different connections ==&gt; different files, or things won't work.

</I>&gt;<i> pretty. Auth being on a separate file than the &quot;old&quot; userprofile db, 
</I>&gt;<i> data can't be copied over automatically. So, two ways to go at this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Run without any pre-action, reset the password, then the right auth 
</I>&gt;<i> data will be placed in the right file. (this is what I meant in my 
</I>&gt;<i> previous email, runs without pre-action)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Use the old userprofiles.db as the basis for both the new 
</I>&gt;<i> useraccounts table and the auth tables. In other words, copy 
</I>&gt;<i> userprofiles.db to auth.db, then run. I have a migration in auth that 
</I>&gt;<i> will copy the auth data over to the auth table from the old users table.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But now, the question. Why do you think that people running OpenSim over 
</I>&gt;<i> SQLite have multiple user accounts, like one expects from people running 
</I>&gt;<i> a real DB? Can you give me some rough numbers for who is doing that?
</I>
You're right - I don't have any numbers so perhaps no-one is doing that.  I took the liberty of copying this over to the users list to see if any hands are raised there.

If SQLite is just being used for single person/demonstration installations then password reset sounds good enough.  I agree that it's not worth wasting valuable time on a more complete solution.

As long as it's brightly and loudly documented then I think that would be okay.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I was under the impression that SQLite is being used for quick trials 
</I>&gt;<i> and for single-person worlds. I would *strongly* discourage people from 
</I>&gt;<i> using SQLite-powered OpenSims as if this was a sustainable multi-user 
</I>&gt;<i> configuration. It's not. It will bomb. Mantis #4437 is a good example of 
</I>&gt;<i> SQLite bombing on people. Had a bug like that affected MySQL, it would 
</I>&gt;<i> have been fixed in no time. It affecting SQLite, the issue has been open 
</I>&gt;<i> for over 2 months, and the fix is not in sight. More than SQLite 
</I>&gt;<i> performing poorly, which it does for large DBs, the main danger here is 
</I>&gt;<i> the lack of support for when things go wrong.
