<PRE>Hello All...

I just started at looking at OpenSim and managed to get the &quot;Diva&quot;
distribution installed in Sun/Oracle's VirtualBox running under Unbuntu. I'm
evaluating it as part of  programs we might like to use it with for our K8
students. It was pretty easy to get started, and with the ability to export
the VirtualBox as an &quot;appliance/image&quot; it would be easy to create and and
share an OpenSim environment in &quot;appliance format,&quot;  lesson plans, avatars,
beginning inventories, etc. etc.  by just sharing the VirtualBox applicance
on DVD.   ...Everything preconfigured and ready to go. I actually tested
this out with my son (9th grader) and he was able to pick it up pretty
quick.

Here's my question. If I have multiple people developing the content for a
&quot;pre-packaged&quot; OpenSim curriculum, what is the easiest way to collect these
assets, centralize them, and then load them up into and target sim for
sharing?


-I have looked at the SecondInventory product. It looks like a possible
solution, but not sure if it would work with multiple students and teachers
saving to a common repository?

-I also looked at the short section on IAR files. This appears to be a good
way to archive and save out individual build items, houses, furniture, etc.
etc. I was thinking this would be better than SecondInventory, however I
must not be using it correctly. Here's what I did:
1. Downloaded the sample iar file from the OpenSim site.
(my-great-items.iar)
2. Moved the iar sample into the documents folder on my server
3. Used the following command:  load iar Dr. Klink
Documents/my-great-items.iar IAR-Additions/ mySuperSecretPassword

This is what I get:

[Inventory Archiver]: PLEASE NOT THAT THIS FACILITY IS EXPERIMENTAL. BUG
REPORTS WELCOME.
[Inventory Archiver]: Loading archive mySyoerSecretPassword to inventory
path Documents/my-great-items.iar for Dr. Klink
[Inventory Archiver]: Password for user Dr. Klink incorrect. Please try
again.

The second line seems a little strange. Is it supposed to report back the
avatar password there?

Also, if there is a better way to save build assets off the OpenSim, I'd be
much appreciative!

Thank you!
