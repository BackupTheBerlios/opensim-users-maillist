<PRE>Thanks Karen!

     You and John (and anyone else so inclined) may feel free to email me
directly if you like.  I will now be backing away from the OpenSim lists
(once again).

     I received flack for complaining too much here in the past, and then
flack for offering to financially support contributors for their time and
effort, and now complaints for being jovial and making an attempt toward
positive, active discussion rather than spewing negativity as I'd
unfortunately done in the past.

     I do realize these conversations have leaned a bit off-topic and for
that I sincerely apologize to everyone who found my 'contributions' annoying
and meaningless drivel.  I'd felt, incorrectly, that open, positive dialogue
would encourage others to join in on the fray and maybe assist in
encouraging more contributors, supporters and overall general camaraderie of
all involved in the project.

     So, to quote the infamous Douglas Adams, &quot;So long, and thanks for all
the fish!&quot;

- Len W. Brown
