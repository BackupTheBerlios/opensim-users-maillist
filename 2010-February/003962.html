<PRE>Frankly everything I make in SL ro OSGrid is free, full permissions.
Generally when I box them, the boxes include separate full perm copies of
scripts and textures. I find that gets over my concerns of people copying my
work - I'm just thrilled to see others getting a use of it and modifying it
- if someone wants to rebrand and sell it, thats OK, good luck to them -
I've got plenty of other Ideas and designs that are on the boil.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> plagiarizes their content and since the introduction of the DMCA they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have a certain level of recourse in compelling the service providers

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It's probably not worth the cost of the time and effort needed for it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to come to fruition, and it would likely only result in the offenders
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> removing her copy-written material with no way of getting monetary

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; three years ago, I started to just give stuff away. I realized there is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> no way to secure
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; your items you try to sell in SL or in anything online social network
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> now days. Not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; enough money in it and pirateers will always.. and I do mean ALWAYS find
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a way if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; they want it bad enough. The way I personally look at it, if you don't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mind your stuff
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; getting stolen then put it out there, otherwise your just wasting time
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> trying to secure
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For some reason I have never really been able to agree with this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> particular point of view.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Photographers, writers, music, radio, television and movie producers
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have all been subject to people copying their content, using it in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ways they never intended, giving free copies away, selling duplicates,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or even plagiarizing, often without the original creator getting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> credit.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yet for some reason when someone fails at any of the businesses
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> associated with these types of products, the fact that their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> intellectual property can (and will be) illegally copied, is rarely
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cited as the primary reason for failure to be profitable, become well
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> known, or help out your fellow man (depending on your original goals.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> With proper marketing making it easy for people to find you, with good
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pricing so that your competitive, with support that makes it clear
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it's better to use your direct products rather than knock offs or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> copies, with continued innovation of new products and services it is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> possible to not only make a profit, but to make a living producing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> material than can (and will be) stolen.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, I'll admit there are many out there that wish they could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> create/invent a handful of items and through the patent, copyright, or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> trademark laws be able to sell their creation without the associated
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> business costs of dealing with copy cats and thieves, so that they can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> make profit from their intellectual property in perpetuity.  But the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> simple fact of the matter is, that type of business climate started
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> slipping away in the 40's and is increasingly difficult to achieve.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Especially in a digital market place, where it is relatively easy for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> your IP to be stolen.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For me it's not really so much &quot;if you don't mind your stuff getting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stolen&quot; -- I don't really think anyone likes to have their stuff
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stolen.  For me it's more about recognizing the market place, and the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> requirements and repercussions of doing business in that market, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> making an informed decision to compete or not.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> On a personal note, I think a lot of the artists could make quite a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bit of additional profit bylicensing their textures and creations via
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a normal web site, using paypal, that does not directly target SL or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> any particular Grid.  I have for example, tracked down an artist that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sells textures via TRU (who has a strict no non-SL policy), and found
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that the artist licensing their own textures via the web for use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *anywhere* and doesn't even mention SL on their website.  The web site
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> happens to directly mention Poser/Daz3D, game and 3D content
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> developers.  I was more than willing to pay $30/USD to buy their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> texture pack outside SL, and as per the terms of the license I can use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> those anywhere (including in SL or OSGrid) as long as I don't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> redistribute them as a texture pack -- I'm free to use them on my own
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> creations, even if I'm selling them.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> --
