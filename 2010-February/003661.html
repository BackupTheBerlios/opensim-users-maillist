Well as a grid owner running a public grid i have a few thughts to that.
 The 1st would be that frontends/web interface's have a big part as thats
how one would make an accunt anyway. Its not hard to have a exp. date and
offers 'should thay wish' to be a full menber. That matters to the user that
likes what thay see and donot have to re-enter it all over again.

The next part is what about the kruft? The junk left in the db. While that
could add up IF you had a boat load of looky loo's but actualy its verry
small. Yes it will add more to the assets db but given the exp. date it
would be akin to tossing a pebble into the grand canyon. I say that because
to import anything to a scale that it matters, takes time. The acount
expires unless the user wants to stay.

A good bit of this is mostly done in the frontend interface not so mutch
core. It has to be the way it is so that 3rd party minds can work on what
you want.

Mostly my thought is the kuft is so low and purging it risky.. ill take the
kruft 

Now IF i wanted to do that as you said so well. Assuming alot of 'visitors'.
I would send there data to a temp. media. a sub data base. Unless the
user/visitor desides to stay , the front would just move the temp db in the
main one. 

Part of the problem is that a 'Vistor' is intrested to know what a 3d world
is, how it works what can it do. Crippling any part of it for them is
counter to the point.

End thought is the KRUFT is of no real problem. Drop in the pool

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. When the user logs in, they have access to the Library part of the 
</I>&gt;<i> inventory, but are
</I>&gt;<i>     unable to load any assets to the server, thus they would have 
</I>&gt;<i> nothing under &quot;My Inventory&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>     or be able to copy items from the Library or the world into My 
</I>&gt;<i> Inventory. The Library
</I>&gt;<i>     would contain all necessities (clothing, basic objects and scripts 
</I>&gt;<i> that they require
</I>&gt;<i>     in the space).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3. The user cannot build on the island but can run scripts and navigate 
</I>&gt;<i> performing full
</I>&gt;<i>     interaction.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> #1 is not a huge issue since I would imagine that the incremental space 
</I>&gt;<i> allocation for
</I>&gt;<i> users just means additional rows in the user/agent tables -- shouldn't 
</I>&gt;<i> take up too much
</I>&gt;<i> room. #2 is a bigger problem - visitors should not be taxing the asset 
</I>&gt;<i> server. #3
</I>&gt;<i> can be handled by unchecking both boxes next to Create Objects in About 
</I>&gt;<i> Land-&gt;Options.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Are either #1 or #2 possible? They would seem to be a prerequisite for 
</I>&gt;<i> something approaching
</I>&gt;<i> basic web page services: people come in, visit, and exit while leaving a 
</I>&gt;<i> minimal trace.
</I>&gt;<i> Builders on the other hand, have special login names that give them the 
</I>&gt;<i> capability to build
</I>&gt;<i> and load assets (possible with groups?).
