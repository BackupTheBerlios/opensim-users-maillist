<PRE>You are correct that Second Inventory attempts to suck/blow (love the analogy!) through the user interface, as well as Meerkat and Emerald viewer.

There are at least a couple of &quot;backup&quot; tools that do attempt to save contents this way - NielLife viewer being the most popular right now, even if it is often used as an SL to SL piracy tool.

There is a lot of demand for something that works properly loading and saving OpenSim inventory though. A piracy tool need not bother about frequent errors and minor &quot;fixes&quot;, but a legitimate backup or transfer tool needs to be virtually error free to be useful.

Neither Second Inventory nor Neillife handle the OpenSim interface very well at present - I suspect that this is the reason. 

The Niellife internal format is already XML so it should need only minor changes to generate a true IAR file. 

The SI &quot;local drive&quot; files are encrypted so there is no way to know.

I will post a copy of this to both blogs to see if maybe at least ONE of them will produce a workable backup/transfer tool for OpenSim!
