<PRE>Folks,

James made a reasonable request.
&quot;How about taking these marathon email threads to a private CC list?&quot;
 I will make it more explicit.

If you want to post to the list to share information useful to the general
population of OpenSim users,   Please DO!!   Simple netiquette rules
apply,   post it with a meaningful subject,  make it concise, and provide
references to where more can be learned about the topic you wish to discuss.

Since the automated nature of this list sends emails to all recipients
whenever you are too lazy to do anything other than hit a reply button, so
you can post your  &quot;I agree&quot;...   PLEASE consider  cutting the RELEVANT part
of the prior post..  and THEN consider if that is vitally important for us
to know.   OTHERWISE  send an email to the person you agree with   instead
of all of us.

If you want to post information about how &quot;L33T' you are, how bad you think
patent attorneys are, how DRM can be circumvented , or the fact that you
personally hate sculpties,   Please DO NOT!

If your intent is to flaunt the fact that you are intentionally violating
the Linden labs terms of service or  boast about how efficient it is to get
pirated content via this URL vs another,  Please  talk to a good lawyer and
take those discussions elsewhere.

There are a lot of people dedicating significant amounts of TIME and MONEY
trying to make OpenSim a working application platform.   One of the  MAJOR
hurdles to that effort is the fact that anyone who comes to see what the
user community is about sees POST after POST after POST detailing your basic
disregard for the concepts of content ownership.     They AREN'T going to
read your sentence at the end where you &quot;disclaim&quot; any relationship with the
folks generating tools designed to rip legitimate content.

Honestly.   Please..   If your bitch with Linden Labs is about your
inability to make backups of the things you designed on the SL platform,
take it to their forums.   Your postss here do nothing to resolve that
issue.  Your continued discussion of methods of exporting SL content to
OpenSim just makes us ALL look like we share your disregard for the contract
you entered when you agreed to use SL.    There are dedicated efforts to
making legitimate backup tools for content creators in OpenSim.  Once those
tools are in place, OpenSim will have a competitive advantage.  That
advantage will be useless when all of our future customers are wondering if
we are still using all of these other &quot;tools&quot;.
