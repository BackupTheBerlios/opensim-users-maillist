<PRE>That is rather odd... And I only see this happen on the Windows version of OpenSim. I wonder if it's a difference between running it with the .NET Framework in Windows as opposed to Mono in Linux? That is the only apparent difference I can see between the two set ups. I wanted to switch my OpenSim use over to Windows because .NET seems to be capable of compiling scripts a lot faster than Mono; but with the random missing data that seems to be happening here, it's too much of a risk for me right now.

  I've experienced this as well recently.  But in my case the &quot;uploaded&quot; texture is always designated as 0x0 in size.  It's intermittent but seems only to happen when trying to upload multiple textures at once.  And as with others have said, I can almost certainly tell when this will be the case if the uploads suddenly appear to lag some.

    I'm not sure to be honest. This happens when trying to view recently
    uploaded textures from the inventory. The data also appears to be
    nonexistant for other recently uploaded items as well, such as animations
    and sounds... That is they appear to work fine until the server is shut down
    and restarted, then the data is gone o.O I've only noticed this on the
    windows version of OpenSim.

    &gt; That sounds rather like what has been reported in mantis 0004331
    &gt; The avatar textures are there momentarily on rebake, but then white out,
    &gt; possibly because the baked textures are not uploading??

    &gt;&gt; On some versions &quot;quit&quot; did not update the database before shutting
    &gt;&gt; down!
    &gt;&gt;
    &gt;&gt; There also seem to be some SQL level problems as well although I have not
    &gt;&gt;  yet been able to isolate them. I find that items sometimes simply &quot;lose&quot;
    &gt;&gt;  their textures and appear as white. I am unable to reproduce that effect
    &gt;&gt;  consitently, once I do I will add a JIRA report.

    &gt;&gt; &gt; Date: Tuesday, February 9, 2010, 10:59 PM
    &gt;&gt; &gt;
    &gt;&gt; &gt;
    &gt;&gt; &gt; I am having trouble
    &gt;&gt; &gt; with uploading animations,
    &gt;&gt; &gt; textures, sounds, etc to OpenSim when running it under
    &gt;&gt; &gt; Windows.
    &gt;&gt; &gt; About a third to half of
    &gt;&gt; &gt; the time I upload anything
    &gt;&gt; &gt; to OpenSim, it takes a few seconds longer than usual to
    &gt;&gt; &gt; upload
    &gt;&gt; &gt; the data (especially
    &gt;&gt; &gt; noticable when performing a
    &gt;&gt; &gt; bulk upload of said data). That in itself isn't too
    &gt;&gt; &gt; worrisome to
    &gt;&gt; &gt; me,
    &gt;&gt; &gt; but, if I log off OpenSim,
    &gt;&gt; &gt; shut the server down
    &gt;&gt; &gt; using the 'quit' command and restart it, and log
    &gt;&gt; &gt; back into OpenSim,
    &gt;&gt; &gt; the data that I uploaded
    &gt;&gt; &gt; appears to be gone. The
    &gt;&gt; &gt; inventory objects referring to the data appears to still be
    &gt;&gt; &gt; in
    &gt;&gt; &gt; inventory,
    &gt;&gt; &gt; but the data that it
    &gt;&gt; &gt; refers to on the asset server
    &gt;&gt; &gt; seems to be null and void.
    &gt;&gt; &gt;
    &gt;&gt; &gt; For instance, if I
    &gt;&gt; &gt; uploaded a few (say
    &gt;&gt; &gt; 10 to 20) textures with the bulk import
    &gt;&gt; &gt; command, log off, shut
    &gt;&gt; &gt; down and restart the server, and log back in;
    &gt;&gt; &gt; I can still see that the
    &gt;&gt; &gt; textures I uploaded are
    &gt;&gt; &gt; still apparently in my inventory, but if I try to open them
    &gt;&gt; &gt; to view the
    &gt;&gt; &gt; textures, all
    &gt;&gt; &gt; it gives me is a blank
    &gt;&gt; &gt; white texture that is
    &gt;&gt; &gt; 256x256 in size. Same goes for animations and sounds that
    &gt;&gt; &gt; don't appear to
    &gt;&gt; &gt; upload
    &gt;&gt; &gt; correctly; except the
    &gt;&gt; &gt; animations won't play and the
    &gt;&gt; &gt; sounds won't play if it was a &quot;bad&quot;
    &gt;&gt; &gt; upload. I've tried clearing my viewer
    &gt;&gt; &gt; cache and relogging,
    &gt;&gt; &gt; but the data is still
    &gt;&gt; &gt; gone.
    &gt;&gt; &gt;
    &gt;&gt; &gt; I can tell it will be a
    &gt;&gt; &gt; bad upload when using bulk
    &gt;&gt; &gt; because it takes quite a few seconds longer per file to
    &gt;&gt; &gt; upload than
    &gt;&gt; &gt; usual.
    &gt;&gt; &gt; The server output seems to
    &gt;&gt; &gt; be normal in that it is
    &gt;&gt; &gt; acknowledging that it is receiving the uploaded data... But
    &gt;&gt; &gt; the persistance
    &gt;&gt; &gt; of
    &gt;&gt; &gt; it seems to be gone about
    &gt;&gt; &gt; a third to half of the
    &gt;&gt; &gt; time I upload data. I can access the data that was
    &gt;&gt; &gt; uploaded perfectly
    &gt;&gt; &gt; fine... as long as I
    &gt;&gt; &gt; do not log off and/or
    &gt;&gt; &gt; restart the server. Other
    &gt;&gt; &gt; times the data will persist fine between logging and/or
    &gt;&gt; &gt; restarting the server
    &gt;&gt; &gt; (this is characterized
    &gt;&gt; &gt; by the data uploading at a
    &gt;&gt; &gt; quick and steady pace
    &gt;&gt; &gt; rather than hesitating between each upload).
    &gt;&gt; &gt;
    &gt;&gt; &gt; I've double checked my
    &gt;&gt; &gt; MySQL, OpenSim.ini, and also
    &gt;&gt; &gt; my Cenome Cache settings, every thing seems to be in
    &gt;&gt; &gt; working
    &gt;&gt; &gt; order.
    &gt;&gt; &gt; I am using the same
    &gt;&gt; &gt; settings in the server I run on
    &gt;&gt; &gt; Linux32 with Mono and uploads do not exhibit this
    &gt;&gt; &gt; strange behaviour with
    &gt;&gt; &gt; Linux.
    &gt;&gt; &gt; Have not changed any
    &gt;&gt; &gt; settings in MySQL except for
    &gt;&gt; &gt; the Max Packet Size which I changed from 1 MB to
    &gt;&gt; &gt; 16 MB to allow
    &gt;&gt; &gt; database
    &gt;&gt; &gt; backup and
    &gt;&gt; &gt; restore.
    &gt;&gt; &gt;
    &gt;&gt; &gt; Specs for my Windows OS
    &gt;&gt; &gt; installation:
    &gt;&gt; &gt; OpenSim git revision
    &gt;&gt; &gt; r12198 (have tried others
    &gt;&gt; &gt; as well) on .NET Framework
    &gt;&gt; &gt; Windows 7
    &gt;&gt; &gt; 32-Bit
    &gt;&gt; &gt; 2.5 GB Ram
    &gt;&gt; &gt; AMD Athlon Dual
    &gt;&gt; &gt; Core @ 1.6
    &gt;&gt; &gt; Ghz
    &gt;&gt; &gt; MySQL 5.1 for
    &gt;&gt; &gt; database
    &gt;&gt; &gt;
    &gt;&gt; &gt; Any help or insight would
    &gt;&gt; &gt; be greatly
    &gt;&gt; &gt; appreciated!
