<PRE>I've always had a strong fondness for expressing my creativity in a 3D
representation.  I was lucky enough to find a platform with Second Life
where I could also see a profit from my interest.

But like with the recording industry, change is inevitable in the platform
and as must likewise learn to adapt.  I believe the most difficult thing to
overcome is the natural tendency toward stagnation of reason.  I want things
to remain the same because that is what I'm most comfortable with.

Second Life of yesteryear is not the Second Life of today, and the same is
true of OpenSim.  For example, I'm so opposed to the use of sculpties it's
almost evangelical in nature.  I absolutely detest them in any &quot;shape, form
or fashion.&quot;  But that is because I'm old school.  I 'cut my teeth' learning
3D virtualization when the basic prim and its derivatives were all you had
to work with, so creatively working with that medium was all I had.  Now one
can create a limitless assortment of items simply by the use of sculpties.

But if I can learn to accommodate sculpt maps into my virtual life, then
surely I can accommodate other changes, including a new business model
surrounding my passion.
