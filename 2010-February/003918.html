</I>I'd like to add here my own personal experience with one of the &quot;banned&quot;
viewers - CryoGen.  Since obtaining a copy of it some time back I've spent a
tremendous amount of time using it on my own personal OpenSim servers and
have grown rather addicted to it.  However, the use of it in Second Life
results in immediate &quot;not open for discussion&quot; banning and account
cancellation so I am very cautious not to use it to log into my SL account.

And, of course, the obvious - that the viewer's intention is to replicate
anything and everything in sight, without any regard for who owns what.  It
simply ignores all rights and permissions.

So why do I think it's better than sliced bread now?  Because I have been
able to save thousands of items I've built over the years in Second Life and
each item is saved as a simple text file - an XML file, to be exact.
Properly named and stored, I have my entire archive of furniture, buildings,
you name it - all saved neatly as little text files.  Even better...
Uncompressed they total *1.54 Gig*, but when I 7-Zipped them, the final
archive was *5.67 Megs*.  I kid you not.  I was then able to upload my
entire prim-based Second Life inventory as a small attachment to an email,
and have put a few other copies here and there on thumb drives, in my Google
Docs storage not that it allows me to upload any file, etc.

You might be wondering how I managed to backup my Second Life inventory
using it without logging into Second Life.  Well, that is the main reason it
is so damned terrifying.  Logging into Second Life using a free account and
the CryoGen browser, and using my premium account to temporarily block the
use of scripts on my land (which can be used to detect and auto-ban users
logged in with CryoGen) I used the free account and CryoGen to walk through
my various stores and replicate everything in sight.

While I do not whatsoever condone stealing in any form, it's an interesting
conundrum for me to have to use &quot;illegal&quot; software to steal MY OWN products,
but as you said about Second Inventory being less than par, CryoGen does a
phenomenal job of allowing me to copy perfectly replicated items from my
shops in SL to my sandbox in OpenSim.
