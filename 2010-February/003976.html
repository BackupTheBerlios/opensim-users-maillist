<PRE>I'd also like to add that I know I can make adjustments to my viewer so the
sculpts render beter and more cleanly, even at greater distances.  But I
feel like &quot;modifying the viewer&quot; so that I can better see the world is like
wearing glasses when I have 20/20 vision.  I already know what the world
looks like and do not need anything to assist me.  If, in its natural state,
the world is a blur and sculpted mess, then there is something, to me,
inherently wrong with the world and it must therefore be repaired.

for me, proper reparation is removing the offending item - sculpts.

&quot;I'm not God, but I play one in OpenSim.&quot;

LOL

&gt;<i> Karen,

</I>&gt;<i> When I fist started seeing sculpties I was impressed.  The rounded edges on
</I>&gt;<i> cushions, the ability to render fully complex tlattices and window frames
</I>&gt;<i> with only a single prim, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But I felt a feeling I can only describe as &quot;nausea&quot; the first few times I
</I>&gt;<i> came upon something and watched its twisted, contorted and violently
</I>&gt;<i> mis-shapen form gradually snap into shape as the sculptmaps rezzed and the
</I>&gt;<i> sculpties themselves take their final form.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A similar feeling comes over me when I either approach something comprised
</I>&gt;<i> of sculpts, or back away from something comprised of them.  The way they
</I>&gt;<i> kind of snap in and out of shape, distorting and forming depending on my
</I>&gt;<i> distance and Internet connection just makes me feel ill.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the other hand, when I walk into a shop that containes objects of the
</I>&gt;<i> same degree of complexity, but that render instantaneously as a series of
</I>&gt;<i> individual prims, I just get this relaxing and calm feeling that &quot;life has
</I>&gt;<i> rendered beautifully&quot; once again.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Like I said, it's a personal thing and I don't expect anyone to understand
</I>&gt;<i> it fully.  It just seems very VERY unnatural for me in a virtual world to
</I>&gt;<i> have sculpted items when the core nature of the world is all a matter of
</I>&gt;<i> X-Y-Z coordinates and clean-cut numerical values to everything.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A prim-based flagpole and flag, for example, to me is a mathematical thing
</I>&gt;<i> of beauty, even as the flag sways in the breeze, it's the result of pure
</I>&gt;<i> numbers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But a sculpted flagpole and flag seems like a massive mess of numbers all
</I>&gt;<i> tangled together and disorganized, trying to make sense but never being
</I>&gt;<i> quite capable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I hope that helps a little bit.  :)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I've always had a strong fondness for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; expressing my creativity in a 3D representation.  I was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; lucky enough to find a platform with Second Life where I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; could also see a profit from my interest.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; But like with the recording industry, change is inevitable
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; in the platform and as must likewise learn to adapt.  I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; believe the most difficult thing to overcome is the natural
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; tendency toward stagnation of reason.  I want things to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; remain the same because that is what I'm most
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; comfortable with.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Second Life of yesteryear is not the Second Life of today,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; and the same is true of OpenSim.  For example, I'm so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; opposed to the use of sculpties it's almost evangelical
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; in nature.  I absolutely detest them in any &quot;shape,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; form or fashion.&quot;  But that is because I'm old
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; school.  I 'cut my teeth' learning 3D
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; virtualization when the basic prim and its derivatives were
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; all you had to work with, so creatively working with that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; medium was all I had.  Now one can create a limitless
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; assortment of items simply by the use of sculpties.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; But if I can learn to accommodate sculpt maps into my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; virtual life, then surely I can accommodate other changes,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; including a new business model surrounding my passion.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
