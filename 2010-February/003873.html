<PRE>Interesting, very interesting.

I'm not an expert in Systems Architecture (well, I'm not an expert in
anything :-P) so my method is &quot;read, try, change, try again, read more...&quot;
but the last posts are opening my eyes. I will look carefully hardware
specs, and will try to tweak operative system... Maybe Windows is not so
evil :-P

About standard asset server, I suffered the problem with Mysql when my
assets table grow up to 6 Gb. Maybe Oracle or MS-SQL can perform better with
blobs...

Thanks for the comments

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Boot up time is around 10 minutes and is impossible to do anything but

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have tested this with 3 machines (4Gb ram, 500Gb hd RAID, Intel Core Duo

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I was using grid mode (grid server on separate computer... no ROBUST or

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Separating Mysql to another machine on the same local network (100 Mbps

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Running opensim on Linux (amd64, 4gb ram, ubuntu server 9.04 64 bits) and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> db
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on separate linux server 2 avatars could work smoothly and filling the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> region with 25000 prims (no simple prims, but different sizes, texturized
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and scripted).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Anyway, that were my &quot;home&quot; experiences... My conclusion: separate db,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> don't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> use windows.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Greetings
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Well 1st a bit on that. going back in time 1.5 years now running
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> opensimulator, At 1st it dident really matter as there wasent enough of a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> DB
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to become a problem with YET. I had to take in account baised on (no was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> really shure about anything) what it was i wanted someday. I knew that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> both
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> linux and win were used but seemed a hot argument and still no one really
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> had an answer for whats best for running a grid on. I Decided  that the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> true way to know is run both and see.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So i purchaced 5 quad core servers all the same equip. ram ect. To me this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would be enough putter power to find out with. Remeber that opensimulator
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> still alpha and was more so then.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I begain testing the MANY ways a grid can be formed and the equip. made it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bit easyer to see it Side By Side in real time.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It dident take long to see that mysql would grow in perpotion to the db
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> size
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as to its own demands.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> At 1st it was faster to have mysql local to the services and was for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sometime. Later it started to glom onto the same resources the instances
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> needed and begain to get verry slow. At that point assets were around 3-4
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> gigs. Seeing the problem i knew i had to do something as the longer i
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> waited
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the worse it would get.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Moved Mysql to another box knowing latency would be there.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That indeed delt with the 'tipping point' it reached. It wasent hard to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> see
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for my selph what happend.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That worked well for sometime but it begain to develop its own problems
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> due
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to the unknowen) as to its settings. Had to readj the MySql settings 4
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> times
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and 2 total rebuilds due to the never ending growth of assest data. When
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hit around 10-11gigs assests a whole new set of problems showed up. The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> big
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one is all that data has to be maintained and backed up. This took most of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> day of downtime as why its doing all that its locking the tables and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Opensimulator freeks. Thats not good and not only is the grid offline but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the amout of time by me to work on it became excessive. As orginaly i had
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bee wise and bought enough computers i spent a good while learing about
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Mysql replication. This does solve some of the problems as it lets me
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> switch
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the services to use the other Mysql and allows maint to happen with little
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> effort.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Only the one maint is beeing done on has tables locked not both.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Moveing to current time. 23+gigs assests and at my goal of 100 regions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (un-told amout of prims and scripts whatever) it was a verry good plan.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is it as fast as it could be? Nope! The problem will allways be there. Is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> scaleable? You betcha!.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I guess my point is Depends on what you expect your grid tobe and planning
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> assuming worse case as best as you can.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Opensimulator is made to be as felxable as it needs tobe and what oper.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> system i find is a push. Both do an excellent job and Both can and do show
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the same performance when set up properly.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For me the differances realy boiled down to what was more comfortable for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> me
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to maintain. In my case im dealing with many servers acting as one. If you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ask me whats better ill say none.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My best suggestion for ppl starting out is expect nothing and be really
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> happy when it all works better than you though
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> :-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There will allways be argument and theroy and thats a good thing but there
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is no better judge than you and what you can see in realtime.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> :working:
