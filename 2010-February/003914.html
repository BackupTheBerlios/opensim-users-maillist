Loading the IAR via &quot;load iar&quot; should have worked as well - I would suggest that you double check your password details first :)

IARs are one solution for this kind of data storage and they should remain compatible with future versions of OpenSim.  They have the advantage of probably being somewhat more reliable and quicker than solutions such as Second Inventory because they directly interface with the server rather than sucking/blowing through the client interface, which isn't built for that kind of thing.  

Of course, this also gives them the disadvantage of only working if you have region console access (though in principle somebody could put an interface on which allows non-region owners to load and save).

As well as second inventory, I know that some of the other SL clients (e.g. Imprudence, Meerkat) have inventory suck and blow built in and store data using a different file format.  I'm not sure what the current state of play is there - last time I looked the contents of items themselves were not being saved/restored.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hello All...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I just started at looking at OpenSim and managed to get the &quot;Diva&quot;  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> distribution installed in Sun/Oracle's VirtualBox running under  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Unbuntu. I'm evaluating it as part of  programs we might like to use  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it with for our K8 students. It was pretty easy to get started, and  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with the ability to export the VirtualBox as an &quot;appliance/image&quot; it  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would be easy to create and and share an OpenSim environment in  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;appliance format,&quot;  lesson plans, avatars,  beginning inventories,  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> etc. etc.  by just sharing the VirtualBox applicance on  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> DVD.   ...Everything preconfigured and ready to go. I actually  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tested this out with my son (9th grader) and he was able to pick it  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> up pretty quick.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Here's my question. If I have multiple people developing the content  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for a &quot;pre-packaged&quot; OpenSim curriculum, what is the easiest way to  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> collect these assets, centralize them, and then load them up into  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and target sim for sharing?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> -I have looked at the SecondInventory product. It looks like a  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> possible solution, but not sure if it would work with multiple  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> students and teachers saving to a common repository?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> -I also looked at the short section on IAR files. This appears to be  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a good way to archive and save out individual build items, houses,  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> furniture, etc. etc. I was thinking this would be better than  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> SecondInventory, however I must not be using it correctly. Here's  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what I did:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1. Downloaded the sample iar file from the OpenSim site. (my-great- 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> items.iar)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2. Moved the iar sample into the documents folder on my server
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3. Used the following command:  load iar Dr. Klink Documents/my- 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> great-items.iar IAR-Additions/ mySuperSecretPassword
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is what I get:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> [Inventory Archiver]: PLEASE NOT THAT THIS FACILITY IS EXPERIMENTAL.  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> BUG REPORTS WELCOME.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> [Inventory Archiver]: Loading archive mySyoerSecretPassword to  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> inventory path Documents/my-great-items.iar for Dr. Klink
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> [Inventory Archiver]: Password for user Dr. Klink incorrect. Please  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> try again.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The second line seems a little strange. Is it supposed to report  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> back the avatar password there?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also, if there is a better way to save build assets off the OpenSim,  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'd be much appreciative!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thank you!
