At this point im not going to go into the settings as of the current changes
on git master has altered things.
There are enough diff. that thay are going tobe correct. As we know this
changes alot each day and would be speculation on my part. A few new twists
is that the land parcles that were fine (b4 the last git pull ) were ok are
now changed and not quite working as before. Also the loop i was seeing is
back and no longer effected now with the changes i had done to that point.
So ill end this here and at this point most of this is still correct. Who
knows what is next changes will be or how long my findings will be of use
but at least to my knowlage by actualy trying this, it is still useable.

</I>&gt;<i> being use to this taking like 20min to reload again,now it took about
</I>&gt;<i> 15min. Logged back in thinking that got it! but all it seemed to do was
</I>&gt;<i> make it reload faster, bandwidth use was the same. Next line in the ini is
</I>&gt;<i> usualy this 'use_async_when_possible = false' i change this to
</I>&gt;<i> 'use_async_when_possible = true' leaving the 1st line i changed
</I>&gt;<i> 'async_call_method = BeginInvoke' as it seemed to help a bit as far as the
</I>&gt;<i> time it took to load the instance. After another reload finnaly no more
</I>&gt;<i> loop! Bandwidth showed 0kbps as it normaly did on the non-megaregion
</I>&gt;<i> version of it.
</I>&gt;<i> As i dident want to get into a bug hunt as to the why of it. I left it
</I>&gt;<i> like that. 
</I>&gt;<i> It seems to have caused no harm it also (other than the bandwidth problem)
</I>&gt;<i> dident gain any better performance. not noticable at wire speeds anyway.
</I>&gt;<i> Im shure it would impact web connected clients and if that happened for
</I>&gt;<i> each client that is logged on would prob. end up as bad thing. 
</I>&gt;<i> I am working on other tweeks but i thought that may be important to know
</I>&gt;<i> should someone run into that. Why my changes may not be the best ones it
</I>&gt;<i> did stop the loop.
</I>&gt;<i> A side note: When it was looping, i tryed a few things and found for some
</I>&gt;<i> resion when i sat in my car to drive around. the loop stoped untill i got
</I>&gt;<i> out and it started again. I tryed sitting on other things but only sitting
</I>&gt;<i> in the car broke the loop. Verry odd. After the changes, it dident matter
</I>&gt;<i> ether way so ill leave it at that. BTW all of this testing is in 32bit
</I>&gt;<i> mode and using the 32bit launcher not Opensim.exe.
