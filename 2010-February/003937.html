<PRE>There have been several public domain versions of plants available for a long time now. 

OpenSim even has a &quot;tree&quot; module which will create a virtual forest with included trees (one of which is a palm tree).

Most of the ones I recognise as being derived from various 3d libraries including Renderosity free stuff.

Do you actually have some evidence that these trees are copied from Lilith Heart or is this just that &quot;they look very similar&quot;.

Lets not go down the same path as Second Life with this mindless hysteria without at least some evidence of actual wrongdoing.

Over the years I have built quite a lot of content which I am willing to donate to OpenSim users, but I am not willing to risk being labled a crook as a result!

</I>&gt;<i> I created an account on OSGrid back in
</I>&gt;<i> November of 2007.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; These days I spend an enormous amount of time
</I>&gt;<i> there with some of my publicly accessible regions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Yesterday I relocated one of my homestead regions
</I>&gt;<i> and where I put it was next to about 5
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;pirate/island&quot; themed sims/regions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Being nosy, I flew around my neighboring
</I>&gt;<i> regions.&#160; And lo and behold I found and extraordinary
</I>&gt;<i> collection of palm trees swaying in the breeze and luxurious
</I>&gt;<i> tropical plants as far as my eyes could see.&#160; And yet, this
</I>&gt;<i> entire world seemed a bit more than faintly familiar...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Upon closer inspection, every single palm tree,
</I>&gt;<i> bush, shrub, grass, tree, and water lily bore a certain
</I>&gt;<i> extreme recognizability...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; I wonder if Lilith Heart, who has made her fortune
</I>&gt;<i> selling an endless variety of absolutely beautiful plants in
</I>&gt;<i> Second Life knows that her years of devoted and hard work
</I>&gt;<i> have been cleanly ripped and presented all over OSGrid?&#160;
</I>&gt;<i> And in what probably amounted to a couple hours of image
</I>&gt;<i> ripping and XML exporting...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Sadly, there's not a single thing she can
</I>&gt;<i> do.&#160; Which is why, though I happily imported my entire
</I>&gt;<i> furniture and building collection into OpenSim, not a single
</I>&gt;<i> piece of it is (yet) available to the general public on
</I>&gt;<i> OSGrid.&#160; I eventually plan to make it all available, but
</I>&gt;<i> the simple fact is, when I do, it will immediately be ripped
</I>&gt;<i> to shreds and will be found spread out all over the grid.&#160;
</I>&gt;<i> Not such a bad thing to one degree since the furniture is
</I>&gt;<i> all very highly detailed, but it will surely put a very
</I>&gt;<i> resoundingly obvious period at the end of my virtual
</I>&gt;<i> business endeavors.&#160; In other words, I don't see a
</I>&gt;<i> penny from it.
