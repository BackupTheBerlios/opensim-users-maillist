<PRE>I have simply GOT to investigate BVH creation more.  I have a number of
ideas I'd like to try out.

One thing has to do with tinies and my own &quot;single prim avatar.&quot;  As it
stands the best way to compress my core avatar form is to set all sliders to
zero (pretty much) and then use an animation overrider that folds my arms
and legs into themselves so essentially I'm a small head and torso with
stumps for arms and legs and even my head shoved down into the torso.  The
final step is to create a prim slightly larger than the longest aspect of my
body.

I have recently been messing around with Blender and an export to BVH plugin
for it, but not enough that my creations are very useful or realistic.

</I>&gt;<i> Neil brags about being the only one to copy animations which could be
</I>&gt;<i> useful if they were converted to a BVH file. I understand that the internal
</I>&gt;<i> database representation is a BVH form and picking at my OpenSim database
</I>&gt;<i> tends to confirm this. It is not in a form that can be output directly as a
</I>&gt;<i> text file though.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Second Inventory promises to output BVH animations in their next release
</I>&gt;<i> (whenever THAT finally happens :-( ), so it is not worth a lot of effort to

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As much as anything I want the BVH files so I can make small changes to the
</I>&gt;<i> actual animations that I use, things like different actions for the arms
</I>&gt;<i> while walking or whatever.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Lots to explore still ...
