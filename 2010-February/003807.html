<PRE>I have noticed that since the November or December series of git revisions (0.7.9 Dev) , prim physics of any kind seem to quit working.
Whenever I create a new prim, raise it up in the air a bit, and then check the 'Physical' check box under object parameters the prim just stays in the air. If i edit the prim, I find that the Physical check box has become unchecked. I have checked my OpenSim.ini for the physics settings and it seems to be correct. I've tried other physics engines as well to no avail. I did some research on it and the only thing close to my problem that I could find was that bad sculpties can cause physics to quit working. So I completely emptied my regions (after backing up oars of course) to get rid of any possible bad sculpted objects, restarted OpenSim, and prim physics still exhibits this bizzare behavior. After this, I backed my MySQL database up to a sql file, deleted the databse for OpenSim, limited my regions to just one region, and ran OpenSim again through initial setup of a new database, logged in, and prim physics is still showing the same symptoms. I can walk, run, jump, fly, etc. just fine. It just seems that physics for prims is gone.

Has anything changed recently with the configuration/setup for physics? This has been a real head scratcher for me lol.

Any thoughts/help would be greatly appreciated!
