<PRE>Sadly like so many schemes that only works until some crook fakes the &quot;do not copy flag&quot; or something similar.

Even something which is a &quot;closely held&quot; as the IPod has similar problems. I did a search for Ipod apps on Pirate Bay the other day. 

They are always a good check of what works and what doesn't!

I found more than 1000 items, including all kinds of MP3s, software, and &quot;hacks&quot;!

Many many very competent people have worked on Digital Rights Management (DRM), but as far as I know there has never been any solution worth the trouble and hassle involved!

That doesn't stop the snake oil salesman from claiming to have &quot;the ultimate&quot; solution of course.We are seeing that on Second Life right now.

</I>&gt;<i> Actulay ill dabble in a bit of what IF here. 1st off
</I>&gt;<i> blocking users or
</I>&gt;<i> clients isant the problem and as we know not effective
</I>&gt;<i> really. 
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is the content it selph has no safegurds. 
</I>&gt;<i> In my way of thinking at this stage of opensimulator dev.
</I>&gt;<i> We can add in
</I>&gt;<i> some.
</I>&gt;<i> One could be what ill call a 3rd state of perms. for
</I>&gt;<i> example: I make a chair
</I>&gt;<i> i set it no copy. That could also set a 3rd state that sets
</I>&gt;<i> a NO EXPORT FLAG
</I>&gt;<i> to the assest server. Now lets say i do want to give it
</I>&gt;<i> away to anyone. So i
</I>&gt;<i> set it so anyone can copy. It would then drop the no export
</I>&gt;<i> flag from the
</I>&gt;<i> oject and insted add the users water mark. That item can
</I>&gt;<i> now be exported and
</I>&gt;<i> be traceable at the same time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Other Opensimulators can test for the watermark and export
</I>&gt;<i> flag used to
</I>&gt;<i> decide if it can be imported. (might help keep fakes out).
</I>&gt;<i> Watermarks could
</I>&gt;<i> be portable for the user that can be used to authenticate
</I>&gt;<i> them as the
</I>&gt;<i> creator and where it was 1st made evan if its on another
</I>&gt;<i> grid.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Im shure i havent thought this thru well enough but i still
</I>&gt;<i> feel protection
</I>&gt;<i> of content has to be part of the content its selph. At
</I>&gt;<i> least the abuilty to
</I>&gt;<i> do things like that would give Opensimulator the tools to
</I>&gt;<i> make a good 1st
</I>&gt;<i> step twords anti-content theft.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I know all this is alot more complicated todo than it
</I>&gt;<i> sounds and thats why
</I>&gt;<i> its just a What If .
