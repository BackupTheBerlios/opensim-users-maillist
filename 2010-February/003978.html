The greatest weakness of our virtual environment is that it must ultimately
be rendered within the confines of a viewer application to make the world
visible on our computer screens.  This, by its very nature, makes it
impossible to protect any content whatsoever.

It's like all the copyguards surrounding video.  they all work well and
great when attempting media to media copying, as in disc duplication.
However, the moment the video is rendered on a screen then it is ultimately
vulnerable to exploitation.

One of the easiest, fastest and most sure-fire ways to &quot;steal&quot; a new movie
in the theaters is by simply using a video camera in the theater to record
the video as it plays on-screen.

With virtual worlds, the fact that everything must ultimately be rendered so
that we can see and enjoy it, also means that circumventions can easily
exist to exploit the rendering and thus be &quot;recorded&quot; and saved by an
unscrupulous pirate who can then do whatever they wish with the end result.

Well i think its more a matter of making it less attractive for someone to
do mostly. If there is no use for stolen stuff because the system wount let
it be imported or exported is part of it. The other would be a type of water
mark in it to. Why i agree most all of that wount stop it, it could at least
leave a verry bad taste in there mouth. Most users are verry cool and dont
want problems from anyone and tend to do the right things. As it is were not
really trying at all and i think anything is better than nothing. 

We dont have to make it easy or attrative for the bad guys though. :-)
