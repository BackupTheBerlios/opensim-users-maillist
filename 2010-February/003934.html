I know of a number of people who were banned from Second Life within minutes
after simply logging into SL with a &quot;bad&quot; viewer.  One of them is the person
I got my copy of CryoGen from.  He showed me twice in-world how it worked,
before both times suddenly disappearing, then via Google Talk explaining
that he got &quot;auto-banned&quot; again and had to spoof a different IP address then
create a new free account before he could log back in again.

The idea of being &quot;banned for selling stolen content&quot; doesn't even exist
here.  There is absolutely no way the stolen content can be identified as
stolen.  Unless the original creator can prove that custom textures in use
were ripped using something like the OpenGL texture ripper tool that hackers
can also use in Second Life.  The object itself is 100% entirely identified
as created and constructed by who-ever rezzes it in-world from the saved XML
files previously ripped.

Of course, if you are selling an item that is &quot;obviously&quot; an exact duplicate
of something a well-known seller offers, then it's pretty easy to assume
you're a thief.  But the vast bulk of everyday items can be slightly
modified or a different texture or shade applied to it, and suddenly it
appears like it's an original created by you and you alone.
