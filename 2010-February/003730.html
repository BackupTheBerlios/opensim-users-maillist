Has anyone considered the fact that Freeswitch is set to ONE IP URL ?  If it
had a way to roam through different IPs then it would know that the person
is going from one server to the next. Here is a test. Try making a 2 Region
SIM on one server. See if it keeps the voice going between the two. If it
does then you scored. If not then my theory went out the door here.  lol

If you then cross into another server ( computer with different IP ) and it
loose voice, then you found your problem.

Just a thought.. and don't forget that in the router setting 5060 to TCP AND
UDP. It needs both to acquire a synchronization.

One of my staff members and myself from my company are working on a new PBX
Server from scratch. We are making it specific for my Grid. If successful,
i'll share it out there with you all and see if I can help you integrate it
into your Grids / Sims / Regions / MegaRegions / Servers.

It will be writtin in C#.
