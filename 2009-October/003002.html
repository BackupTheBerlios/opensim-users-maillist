<PRE>Based on a checkout of the code just now (5:30PM EST, Oct. 30), it seems 
that there
have been some improvements to the physics code; however, there are problems
remaining compared with the checkout on 10/19, where there are no physics
issues (default ODE values from 10/19's OpenSim.ini--I checked today's
OpenSim.ini.example, and didn't see any differences in the ODE section 
regarding
variables): This setting is the only non-default:     av_capsule_tilted 
= false.

  * I still am unable to move through two large doorways. There are no 
phantom or
     transparent prims blocking the way--the avatar simply cannot go 
through these
     wide open doorways,  and is blocked by something, but not sure what 
since there
     is no blocking geometry. This means I cannot enter these two buildings.

  * While walking up stairs appear to work reasonably well, walking down 
stairs is
     not possible -- the avatar ends up flying down the stairs without 
touching the
     steps, even if going slowly.

   * The mesh collision problems (walking through stairs) seem to have  
been solved

   * Bounce still happens when flying, and pressing Page-Down or C, but 
not as
      often. In the last git checkout, the bounce always occurred. Now, 
after pressing C
      the avatar sometimes bounces back up and then one must press C 
again to stop
      flying. Sometimes, I must press C 3 or 4 time in a row to stop 
bouncing back up.

   * The feet, rather than overing a little above the ground looks much 
better, although now
       the feet are ever so slightly in the ground (i'd say about the 
latter quarter to
       half of both feet).

NOTE; none of these conditions exist in the 10/19 checkout
