<PRE>Hi and welcome to Opensim!

I found the dependencies much more manageable on a Debian-based distro. (in my 
case Kubuntu).

As far as the big config file goes, once I got it working, I stuck with it 
doing a side-by-side comparison and manual update with the new config-example 
files as they change. A bit tedious, but tedium includes a notable reduction 
in surprises.

If you intend running all the grid-regions yourself off one box, you might 
also look into running a standalone mega-region. Many of the benefits of a 
grid without some of the inter-region issues. I have heard good things about 
Diva's mega-region setup, though I had bootstrapped myself a mega from the 
mainline already before that was available.
