<PRE>I completely agree with you regarding compiling freeswitch:(

But I managed to find windows binary for freeswitch that was really easy.

Would love to run all this on Linux, but we just found better performance and reliability on windows at the moment...

Karen - using ODE physics try creating a 2m ball, hollow it out to 95%, make
it physical, then drop it on the ground. It will either crash your region,
stick to the ground and maybe slide around if you push it, or it will roll
like it should when you push it. Let me know what yours does.

Ollie - yes I actually tried a test install of 0.6.5 and I was not able to
get actual voice to work on the region but the OpenSim log showed that the
Freeswitch module was trying to communcate so it looks like previous to
0.6.5 Freeswitch just won't run with OpenSim. Compiling Freeswitch on Jaunty
is ... well ugly at best. I have been a Unix admin on and off for the last
30 years and I can't get these Linux boxes to behave, and don't get me
started on the whole Mono thing. :)

I agree with Olli. I suggest to upgrade your opensim and try it again. 
I'm using opensim 0.6.5 Alpha in conjunction with freeswitch 1.0.3 and 
it works fine. I have installed it successfully on ubuntu 9.04 and on a 
windows platform. It was a little bit tricky to compile it on windows, 
but with the help of the manual on www.opensim.de it was no problem to 
get it working on linux. If you start your opensim and freeswitch the 
first time, the freeswitch module responds in general with an error 
message (http error 404) that could be ignored and with some status 
messages, that is &quot;has been answered&quot;. Furthermore, opensim returns some 
[FreeSwitchDirectory] status messages indicating that several requests 
were send. I just tried freeswitch 1.0.3 with opensim 0.6.8 trunk 
version and it works, too :-)

If you have further questions let me know. Maybe I can help.

greetings
Daniel

Yeah so it looks like the voice module is getting disabled because the
configuration problem.

One thing that worries me is that your log file is saying Asterix and the
latest version voice module says [FreeSwitchVoiceModule]. 

If I would be you I would install the latest version of OpenSim and then
see
if you can get the voice working with this first. I have a feeling that
you
might need an upgrade for your current system, since the development
activity around voice has been mainly the last 9-12 months if I have
understood it correctly.

I will try using several other versions of OpenSim to see if that
helps. On
my current install I get the following message when I run OpenSim:
2009-10-07 10:35:43,411 INFO  - OpenSim.Region.Environment.ModuleLoader

2009-10-07 10:35:43,412 INFO  -

I have no idea what I can do to try manually hitting the Freeswitch
server
just to see if it is actually responding.

Yeah we use it all the time. The first time around we worked it out

from

the
OpenSim freeswitch wiki page. I thought that was good documentation

on how

to get things working.

Where are you hitting the brick wall at the moment?

Regards,

Olli

Is there anyone who would be willing to volunteer to teach a class

on

how to
get voice running? Is there anyone even interested in wanting to use
voice
on their regions? There is not really any complete and easy to
understand
information on step by step Voice for Dummies.
