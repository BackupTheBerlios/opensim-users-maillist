<PRE>Hi Kevin,

 

Since the ExternalHostName configuration parameter only allows IP addresses
at the moment, the only way to get behind NAT scenario working for both
external and internal users it to implement some kind of rule in your
firewall that if there is a request coming from the internal network to an
external IP then route it back to the internal IP. However, in most firewall
this kind of requests are blocked by default as suspicious.

 

 So, really the easiest solution to this is to stick your OpenSim server to
DMZ without NAT and with a public IP.

 

I know it is very annoying. I can't wait to see domain names working for
ExternalHostName.

 

Regards,

 

Olli

'Waiting for region handshake' (LoginPacketNeverReceived) on other intranet
computers

 

So this is where I am at (opensim 0.6.6 working externally, but not
accessible on my internal LAN).

 

Many thanks to Clive Gould for getting me this far! (and I'm making this as
detailed as I can to help anyone else stuck on this!)

 

For a 'standalone' implementation, V0.0.6 'Regions.ini' in
(/bin/Regions)needs to look like this:

===========================================

[Test Island]

RegionUUID = 37d57d73-ff97-482f-84ab-4f1f132a4092

Location = 1000,1000

InternalAddress = 0.0.0.0

InternalPort = 9100

AllowAlternatePorts = False

ExternalHostName = 11.22.33.44

MasterAvatarFirstName = 

MasterAvatarLastName = 

MasterAvatarSandboxPassword =

===========================================

Running opensim the first time may enter most of the information - but some
of it is not correct, so you need to edit it.

 

(Note: The wiki's talk extensively about files in '/bin/Regions' called
'default.xml'.  This is no longer the case and this file is replaced by
'Regions.ini' I believe.)

 

The 'ExternalHostName' is your numeric external IP address (11.22.33.44 is
just example which I'll use again later).  I don't believe using a FQDN like
'www.mydomain.co.uk' will work here (unfortunately).

 

I have changed the InternalPort from 9000 to 9100 because I already have
something on Port 9000.

 

In the router I have forwarded port 9100 to IP address 192.168.10.100
(internal IP address of my opensim server PC) for both TCP and UDP packets.

 

Externally, my ISP provides a Dynamic IP Address.  I have a dynamic DNS
service (like dynDNS) which constantly ensures 'www.mydomain.co.uk' points
at my current external IP address ('11.22.33.44').

 

So - in the 2L viewer shortcut I use: &quot;C:\Program
Files\SecondLife\SecondLife.exe&quot;  -loginuri <A HREF="http://www.mydomain.co.uk:9100">http://www.mydomain.co.uk:9100</A>

 

This works fine for a viewer outside the firewall .

 

However - this raises 2 problems.

 

Problem-1:  Whenever my ISP changes my IP address (about once a week) I have
to manually edit 'ExternalHostName' in my 'Regions.ini' file and restart
opensim!

 

Problem2:  I cannot access opensim from inside the firewall (PC's running
Windows XP).  Even though I have edited the 'hosts' file (in
c:Windows/system32/drivers/etc) to forward 'www.mydomain.co.uk' to
192.168.10.100 - so the viewer can 'see' opensim, it hangs at the region
handshake again (because, I guess, the viewer is comparing 192.168.10.100,
which it resolved from the hosts file, with 11.22.33.44 which I also guess
is sent somewhere in the region login packet from opensim).

 

Problem#1 I could live with.  But the fact that it won't login unless the IP
address provided in the viewer exactly matches the address in 'Regions.ini'
makes it unworkable (and it seems a strange requirement - everything up to
that point works just fine!).

 

I noticed from searching the forums that a request to fix this (I think) was
put in by Paul Fishwick a few months ago.  Has it been fixed in a later
revision?

 

Any ongoing help appreciated! - Kevin

 

*UPDATE* - I just saw 0.6.7 has been released - does anyone know if this
issue has been resolved in this version?

I just built it using same ini's as v0.6.6 and the problem still seems to be
there  :-(
