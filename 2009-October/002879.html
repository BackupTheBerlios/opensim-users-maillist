<PRE>Well since anyone can edit it.  Then I decided to update it a little.  Clarified some of the information &amp; put in a link to the Port / Forwarding information.  I think some of the problem is a lot of this was initially written by people that already had it all up and running. so a lot of stuff might have been skipped.  As I discover things I can put in little notes, and we should all probably do the same and mention it in here.

I'd ask the &quot;Old Timers&quot; to take a look to see if what we are updating  makes sense and is accurate. I'd also like to ask about any conflicting information. Would this list be the correct place to ask for answers or would that be on the developers list?

Rich

Sadly the wiki is editable by everyone and when discovering which
bits are right and which bits are wrong, it's the perfect time to 
fix them for the next person ... and those who keep having the same
region handshake issues over and over again (so it seems.)

I know it got me so bummed out after having set up a really cool
standalone grid, only to discover NOBODY could get in, no matter
how many settings of IP addresses, ports forwarded by router, etc.
