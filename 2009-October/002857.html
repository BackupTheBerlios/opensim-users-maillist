<PRE>Hi karen,

Thanks for your email. I once enquired about default character shapes,
textures and animations on IRC and I still have notes about it.

Here they are:The Assets are loaded on startup from various files in
/bin/assets,  so under /bin/assets is a readme file that might help in
understanding what to do next. Animations are just one of the
subdirectories, and it looks like to put them there and load them at
startup, we'd need to convert those bvhs to .dat format....

Maybe we can get something working as a wiki page for people to figure out
how to put them into their default avatar inventory?

I would find a separate website for this more useful in the long run though,
as projects may come and go and new virtual worlds like sirikata might also
be looking for places to store things like this.

If &quot;open licensed&quot; then yes making such a repository would not only be
allowed, but would eb useful to most OpenSim users!

My preferred format would be as a addition to the default library that is
available to every avatar.

I am not sure just how best to do this, but I am sure someone can tell us.
