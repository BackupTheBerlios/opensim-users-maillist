<PRE>I have considered getting the bleeding-edge version, lol.  But I wanted to
start with something stable (...).  Thanks for the suggestion though - but I
DID check my ports with a port scanner.  I'm pretty sure a blocked port
isn't the problem though.  It's weird that it works perfectly if opensim and
the viewer are on the same machine - after all, they STILL talk to each
other via the same network protocols - they just didn't go through a LAN
card and the lower layers is all.  And there's a LOT of interaction before
they get to the region handshake point - so network protocols in general
seem to be just fine.  I was wondering if there is anything tangibly
different about the 'loginpacket' like maybe it goes to an undocumented port
or something which isn't covered in the '.ini' files.  I also have a port
logger - and nothing looks untoward in that either - but it's kinda hard to
analyse unless you know the protocols!

I haven't yet tried just connecting my machines to each other with the
dumbest of routers, rather than going via the Belkin, to see if that makes a
difference.  Cheers, Kevin

I usually run the bleeding edge version in fresh directories (to keep a 
trail
of implementations). This is mainly because of fairly recent changes that
do well with 64-bit Ubuntu. Not sure if this will help, but I have found 
port
scanners to be useful during testing:

However, if you cannot connect even behind your firewall....not sure...

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a pseudo-Static Domain: i.e. a Dynamic Domain Name from the ISP and a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> service from 'deerfield.com' called 'DNS2Go' that tracks it - has

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> like to get opensim running as a standalone-hypergrid implementation - 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but just standalone seemed a good first step. I planned to test it: 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> viewer on same PC as opensim, viewer on different PC but within the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> firewall and finally: remote access using my Static Domain.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> After a few false starts, I built the release on one of my PC's 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (Windows XP SP2) using Port 9100 (Port 9000 is used already by my 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> streaming music system). It works just fine if I use either the 2L 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> viewer (v1.23.4 - 123908) or Hippo viewer, running on the same machine 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as opensim.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, if I run the viewer on different machines within my firewall 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (I have 2 others: Windows XP, also SP2 plus a Vista laptop - both 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tower PC's are high performance Pentium-4's with high-end NVIDIA 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> graphics cards btw) it finds my opensim OK (can see the modified 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> welcome message during login) but hangs at 'Waiting for region 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> handshake'. Then I get the 'may have network issues message' and stops.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I also got a friend to try to login from far away (outside the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> firewall) with the same failure at 'Waiting for region handshake'. I 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> am about 50h into this now and have run out of ideas (and hair). I 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have seen in various forums that a number of people have (are) also 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> experienced this problem - but so far I have never seen a posted
</I>solution.
&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So far I have done the following things (and they have made no 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> difference - behaviour is exactly the same):
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Tried different Ports: 9100, 9200, 9217 and even 9000 by shutting 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> down my music server (changing the port addresses in 'Regions.ini' and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 'opensim.ini')
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Tried 'runprebuild' ('compile' runs with no errors) and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 'runprebuild2008' (path error for .NETFramework - I have v3.5 btw)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Tried '0.0.0.0', '127.0.0.1', '192.168.10.100' (the server PC 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> internal address) as 'InternalAddress' inside 'Regions.ini'
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Tried 'SYSTEMIP' and '192.168.10.100' as 'ExternalHostName' inside 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 'Regions.ini'
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Tried '127.0.0.1', '192.168.10.100' and even my external domain name 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in the various places in 'opensim.ini'
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Tried running the '/bin' application on a different PC on the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> intranet (so then the viewers work OK on that PC but not now on the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> original server PC)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Tried 'AllowAlternatePorts' as both True and False
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - I have inserted the 'AV rezzes as cloud' patch and rebuilt (that 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fixed THAT issue!)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - I have totally rebuilt from scratch many times
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - I have rebooted all the PC's at various times
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Tried router firewall off and on (not that it should matter - router 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is Belkin F5D8635-4v1 btw)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Tried Windows firewalls off and on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Searched high and low on the internet (generally and within the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> opensim forums)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> All to no avail.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> All I have changed in 'opensim.ini' (and 'Regions.ini') are the Port 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and Internet related addresses. The only other thing I changed was 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> somewhere I had to uncomment a line to say which version of cache to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> use. Everything is 'out of the box' (I did, of course, copy the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> '.ini.examples' and convert them to '.ini's as appropriate).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Has anyone had this issue and actually fixed it? How?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Any help really appreciated. I'm a professional programmer by the way 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - but I wasn't intending to have to start diving into the opensim 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> source to fix this!
