<PRE>So this is where I am at (opensim 0.6.6 working externally, but not
accessible on my internal LAN).

 

Many thanks to Clive Gould for getting me this far! (and I'm making this as
detailed as I can to help anyone else stuck on this!)

 

For a 'standalone' implementation, V0.0.6 'Regions.ini' in
(/bin/Regions)needs to look like this:

===========================================

[Test Island]

RegionUUID = 37d57d73-ff97-482f-84ab-4f1f132a4092

Location = 1000,1000

InternalAddress = 0.0.0.0

InternalPort = 9100

AllowAlternatePorts = False

ExternalHostName = 11.22.33.44

MasterAvatarFirstName = 

MasterAvatarLastName = 

MasterAvatarSandboxPassword =

===========================================

Running opensim the first time may enter most of the information - but some
of it is not correct, so you need to edit it.

 

(Note: The wiki's talk extensively about files in '/bin/Regions' called
'default.xml'.  This is no longer the case and this file is replaced by
'Regions.ini' I believe.)

 

The 'ExternalHostName' is your numeric external IP address (11.22.33.44 is
just example which I'll use again later).  I don't believe using a FQDN like
'www.mydomain.co.uk' will work here (unfortunately).

 

I have changed the InternalPort from 9000 to 9100 because I already have
something on Port 9000.

 

In the router I have forwarded port 9100 to IP address 192.168.10.100
(internal IP address of my opensim server PC) for both TCP and UDP packets.

 

Externally, my ISP provides a Dynamic IP Address.  I have a dynamic DNS
service (like dynDNS) which constantly ensures 'www.mydomain.co.uk' points
at my current external IP address ('11.22.33.44').

 

So - in the 2L viewer shortcut I use: &quot;C:\Program
Files\SecondLife\SecondLife.exe&quot;  -loginuri <A HREF="http://www.mydomain.co.uk:9100">http://www.mydomain.co.uk:9100</A>

 

This works fine for a viewer outside the firewall .

 

However - this raises 2 problems.

 

Problem-1:  Whenever my ISP changes my IP address (about once a week) I have
to manually edit 'ExternalHostName' in my 'Regions.ini' file and restart
opensim!

 

Problem2:  I cannot access opensim from inside the firewall (PC's running
Windows XP).  Even though I have edited the 'hosts' file (in
c:Windows/system32/drivers/etc) to forward 'www.mydomain.co.uk' to
192.168.10.100 - so the viewer can 'see' opensim, it hangs at the region
handshake again (because, I guess, the viewer is comparing 192.168.10.100,
which it resolved from the hosts file, with 11.22.33.44 which I also guess
is sent somewhere in the region login packet from opensim).

 

Problem#1 I could live with.  But the fact that it won't login unless the IP
address provided in the viewer exactly matches the address in 'Regions.ini'
makes it unworkable (and it seems a strange requirement - everything up to
that point works just fine!).

 

I noticed from searching the forums that a request to fix this (I think) was
put in by Paul Fishwick a few months ago.  Has it been fixed in a later
revision?

 

Any ongoing help appreciated! - Kevin

 

*UPDATE* - I just saw 0.6.7 has been released - does anyone know if this
issue has been resolved in this version?

I just built it using same ini's as v0.6.6 and the problem still seems to be
there  :-(
