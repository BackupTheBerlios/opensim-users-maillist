<PRE>I thought I would test the current 0.6.7 post-fixes and tool r/11301 
from the GIT web interface zip download.

It prebuillt and compiled fie (the usual warnings on used code 
elements - 44 I note).

I already had a 0.6.6 setup (r/9903) with Hypergrid, UGRM (R=AI) 
setup with 14 .xml specified region files

I brought over the previous changes to the config files into the new 
version as usual and stayed with the UGRM (R=AI) setup.

I just had to alter references in my startup scripts from 
Opensim.Services.exe to Opensim.Server.exe and of course change 
incorporate the previous data base connect string changes into the 
similarly renamed Opensim.Server.ini

Good news is that the system came up fine.

Problems that I spot in initial tests:

a) My avatar is stood with its ankles about 0.1m to 0.2m underneath 
surfaces (whether the object surfaces are 0.5m or 2m deep its still 
the same depth of penetration. If I go on solid terrain, the avatar 
starts failing, drops through the terrain surface, etc. Or if you 
move it a bit, it has ankles below ground with bent knees. If I go 
back on to an object, the avatar straightens up, but still has anjles 
below ground.

b) Using the new region .ini style files, the 
<A HREF="http://virtual.aiai.ed.ac.uk:8002/index.php?method=regionImage1111111...">http://virtual.aiai.ed.ac.uk:8002/index.php?method=regionImage1111111...</A> 
style of call to show region maps on a web page does not work .  This 
is same as 0.6.6.  I think Melanie may have contributed a patch to 
fix that in later versions than 0.6.7?  I wonder if someone has the 
knowledge to incorporate that change in the 0.6.7 postfixes before 
its stable... as it is a visible issue.  I reverted to .xml region 
files and it works fine.

c) Having now disabled DotNetEngine to be ready for the change later 
in 0.6.8, I note one minor extra error I have not seen before... 
indicating System.Invocation.TargetInvocationException saying 
llRemoveVehicleFlags is not implemented.  Its just in a script in a 
vehicle brought over from SL that is not working anyway, so I 
disabled it for now.#

d) I have had one issue when the regions went down while a Viewer 
logged in but could not repeat that, but will do more testing now.

Hope these short notes are useful, Ai
