You could run all the UGAIM and the region server on the same machine, which would be effectively a standalone grid.

&gt;<i>

</I>
Curious - load oar shouldn't affect attachments, since it only ever adds to assets (if necessary).  If you could file a 
Mantis for this with the steps to reproduce I would appreciate it.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When following the instructions for setting up Grid mode I rapidly

</I>&gt;<i> leaving well enough alone.  (mono OpenSim + MySQL storage)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The instructions for setting up Grid mode were thorough up to a
</I>&gt;<i> point, but then stopped without enumerating what has to happen
</I>&gt;<i> to get all of UGAIM running, or what executables + databases +

</I>&gt;<i> because most people who want to run in Grid mode will wish to
</I>&gt;<i> connect to, rather than run their own, services for some
</I>&gt;<i> combination of User, Inventory, Asset,etc.
</I>
The instructions used to be okay, but they may have degenerated with the recent server changes.  There are tutorials 
around on the web which it might be worth googling for.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Am I right in assuming that there's no reason, and therefore no
</I>&gt;<i> complete instructions for, running all of UGAIM services locally?
</I>&gt;<i> (what I would refer to as &quot;Standalone Grid&quot; mode)
</I>
Standalone is certainly simpler, but if one plans to grow the grid then I think that starting off with a 'standalone 
grid' is a perfectly valid thing to do.  It's probably just that the instructions are a bit lacking right now.
