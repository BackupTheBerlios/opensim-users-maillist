<PRE>Is there such thing as a 'standalone grid' mode?  I'm not sure
how OpenSim deals with multiple regions' assets and inventories
for the same avatars teleporting between regions.  I've seen
strange errors about attachment state when teleporting between
regions, but this may be due to abuse of the 'load oar' command,
and how it affects asset UUIDs.

For example, an avatar standing in a region will lose their 
attachments and clothing if &quot;load oar&quot; is run for that region.
Maybe it's intended to only run when no one's around, or you're
still OpenRuth and you have no clothing/attachments to lose. :)

When following the instructions for setting up Grid mode I rapidly
came to the conclusion that it's probably NOT the right way to set
up multiple Regions on the same OpenSim server, and reverted to
leaving well enough alone.  (mono OpenSim + MySQL storage)

The instructions for setting up Grid mode were thorough up to a
point, but then stopped without enumerating what has to happen
to get all of UGAIM running, or what executables + databases +
configurations needed to occur, and I realize that is probably
because most people who want to run in Grid mode will wish to
connect to, rather than run their own, services for some
combination of User, Inventory, Asset,etc.

Am I right in assuming that there's no reason, and therefore no
complete instructions for, running all of UGAIM services locally?
(what I would refer to as &quot;Standalone Grid&quot; mode)
