<PRE>I would be interested in the answer to this as well. I to am running the
Diva server. 

But from what I understand. Diva grid is made to run as a standalone. as
apposed to grid mode, so not sure if its possible. 

Plus if you did make the changes. wouldn't the update application mess this
up?

Subject: [Opensim-users] Multiples of Diva's Megaregion Server

 

I'm a little foggy on coordinating multiple servers and ask for some
clarification...

    Using OpenSim 0.6.5.1 I've classically created multiple region xml files
and utilized that method for having a single OpenSim server to host multiple
regions locally.

     Having now successfully set up and logged into Diva's new distribution
and having begun realizing the benefits of the megaregion concept, at least
when playing around and designing objects locally, I'd like to stich
together several megaregions.

     Specifically I'm wanting to connect 9 megaregions in a 3X3 grid, but
want each megaregion to run independantly on 9 different computers
(actually, I've found with OpenSim 0.6.5.1 that netbooks make wonderful
&quot;stackable&quot; segregated region servers).

     So my plan is to run 9 of Diva's servers on 9 separate netbooks locally
and have them all stiched together as a single &quot;world&quot; of 9 megaregions as a
3X3 grid.

     My main and biggest uncertainty is MySQL administration.  Do they all
run off the same MySQL server?  I'm not familiar with how each region would
know who the user is when logging in regardless of the regions...

     On the most basic level, what must be accomplished here to do this?  I
do not need an extensive explanation, just the basics since I'm enough
familiar with basic single server administration.

Thanks everyone!
