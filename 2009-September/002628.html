<PRE>Thanks a lot for that post, Chris. I'm looking for that solution very, very long and I wondered why I didn't get streaming media to work in OpenSim although it works in Second Life. But now I know why :)

By the way, is there a possibility to update the flash player plugin in the Hippo Viewer to enable playback of current videos hosted on youtube? For me the Viewer complains that the flash player plugin seems to be to old. Is there any chance to update?

I did a blog post about this a while back, and it does indeed get the
viewer displaying web content on a prim like on SL:

It works to a point - you get to see web pages on prims, but there is a
catch - I had trouble after making that change in viewing streaming
media, and others had similar issues. It seems the autodetect code in
the client is not clever enough.

The better solution is to get mime types communicated between the
OpenSim server and the client. I looked into this once before and it was
somewhat tricky to unravel where the communications went (there was some
LibOpenMetaverse involvement).
