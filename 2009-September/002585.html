<PRE>Hey Guys,


I am having some issues which are driving me kind of crazy here. First some
background about the setup, I got 2 dedicated servers, one running the
gridservices and 2 sims, and another one running 7 sims on a linux platform.
Everything was working fine after the update to 0.6.6 with post-fixes for
about one month. Yesterday however there was an unexpected Domain Controller
breakdown at the datacenter, which caused someone to press the button on my
machine(The one wit 7 sims) and reboot it. After this reboot I was able to
fire the 7 sims up once again, but this time with some serious issues. What
happens now is the following; I can cross the regions from one server to the
other without issues(As ussual), I can teleport between the regions on the
different servers(Also as ussual), I can't cross or teleport between the
regions on the server that went down unexpectedly(The one with 7 sims)
anymore. I have tried to restore the DB from backup (Both ugaim and certain
regions) and the problem persists. I have tried to shut down my firewall and
the problem still persists. If anyone has ever experienced this behaviour
and found a solution to it than I am kindly open to suggestions,

Regards and thanks in advance,

Ben
