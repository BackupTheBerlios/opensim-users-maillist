<PRE>Should svn 9993 (0.6.6 release) work with UGRM (R for SA and I) and 
is that the &quot;correct&quot; config to aim for?

I have spent some time trying to get new configuration for a version 
0.6.6 system from the installer for windows ion the 
<A HREF="http://opensimulator.org">http://opensimulator.org</A> entry page... upgrading from a 0.6.3 version 
from April 2009. Can someone in the core team advise on what is the 
correct and fixture direction facing configuration to use for the 
services, as I know I can run with UGAIM in legacy style, or with the 
ROBUST services running the A and I elements or just the A element 
too it seems.  I just don't want to spend more time than I need to 
changing configurations.

I already have realised that theOpenSim.Server.ini.example file 
included with 0.6.6 does not include the entries needed for the 
Inventory Server, but I found those at: <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/ROBUST">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/ROBUST</A>

I think I have a UGRM (with R Inf A and I) now and it seems to be 
coming up and even authenticating SL Viewer 1.23 users at login.  I 
am just getting stuck at the point where the region handshake takes 
place. With SL Viwer on same computer as the UGAIM services and a 
region, or coming in from another viewer with access that worked with 
0.6.3.  I have not yet worked that out as the region XML file IP 
addresses look okay to me. If anyone can give a pointer there to save 
some time it would be helpful.
