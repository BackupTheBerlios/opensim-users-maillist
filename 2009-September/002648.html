<PRE>The way Meerkat appears to work is that it will copy every object that you have selected, including the link structure and textures. 

All embedded scripts, animations are simply dropped - that is the source of the problem I am having!

I have copies some fairly complex buildings this way, including unlinked objects such as doors (mostly).

There are two limits to this, the object must be selected and you must have full perms (and/or be the creator) of EVERY prim in the collection. 

ANY prim for which those conditions are not satisfied is simply dropped.

I have not done any testing on the full perm vs creator (not just owner) condition since everything I want to move is stuff that I have both created and have full perms.

I have read some philosophical debates on whether or not any object that has full perms implies that it be copyable as a backup, but I really don't know the status of those discussions.

Anyway prims, textures, and their links are clearly NOT the immediate problem! There are still some issues on that front which so far seem to be shared by Second Inventory.

Meerkat does not copy scripts either, but if you have full perms on the script you can manually cut and paste the script to OpenSim. 

Almost all Second Life scripts compile under OpenSim 0.66 BTW. 

I am working on JIRA reports for the discrepancies I find, so far it seems to be mostly that the OpenSim script engine does a more thorough check of the code than the Second Life script engine rather than any functional differences.

This is workable solution if you are just setting up an OpenSim world, but really does not solve the problem if you want to create a scene in OpenSim and then port it back to Second Life.

I have around 15,000 separate items in my inventory (some of them are packages of much larger collections) and would like to move about a third of that to OpenSim. 

The Meerkat &quot;selection&quot; system is workable, but slow with that many objects.. It would be quite usable to move a completed build between sims (e.g. my standalone grid to Second Life) - provided that the &quot;backup&quot; included all of my scripts and animations!

With the planned divergence of capability between OpenGrid, RealeXtend, and Second Life there would also need to be some sort of &quot;sanity check&quot; build in to make sure that what was exported would actually &quot;play nice&quot; in the target grid. I know of nothing with that function at present, hence the problem with prims larger than 10m on a side.

My understanding is that Second Inventory uses a more sophisticated system to determine what to export, and that TestClient requires the UUID of each object exported.

So far the only true &quot;show stopper&quot; is animations and gestures!

This is my understanding of the situation as it exists, hopefully someone can correct any errors.
