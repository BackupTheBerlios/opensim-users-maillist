<PRE>Robert,

I don't know what the last revion was where ODE physics worked properly in
that regard.   The physics only seems to work properly if the ball is
selected ( as if you were going to edit it ) after it is made physical.    I
have also experienced problems where physical things ( like balls less than
1M in diameter ) sink into the ground, appearing to ignore the .ini file
specifications for distance to remain above the ground...     It seems to
respect the parameters if i put it on a prim.
Gravity and &quot;external forces&quot;   seem to be applied  but the update rate (
until the object is selected)   will make it seem as though it is NOT
moving.    If you wait long enough it will... but it is obviously NOT
happening in an interesting time frame.

  1.  Physics Issue with 0.6.6 (Robert Klein)
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hey Everyone,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I put this out there on the OSGrid forums but thought I might check you all
</I>&gt;<i> too. Under previous versions of OpenSim I could create a large 3m ball,
</I>&gt;<i> hollow it out, and make it physical then drop it on the ground. Then I
</I>&gt;<i> could
</I>&gt;<i> push it around and it would roll like it should. Now it doesn't roll. It
</I>&gt;<i> just kind of slides along until I stop pushing it. Is anyone else having
</I>&gt;<i> this issue? I have tried it on Ubuntu and Windows with the same results.
</I>&gt;<i> Using ODE and Meshmerizer and MySQL 5.1 for the database. Also tried it
</I>&gt;<i> with
</I>&gt;<i> Hippo and SL viewers. I simply can not get a ball to roll. You might be
</I>&gt;<i> thinking, &quot;who cares if a ball rolls or not?&quot; I do a lot of training and
</I>&gt;<i> stuff like this has become critical to many of the lessons I have designed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Robert
