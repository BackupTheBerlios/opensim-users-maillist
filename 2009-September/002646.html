<PRE>Thanks for the tip Clive!

     I actually recall using Meerkat a while back and it was neat how I
could copy things out of SL and import them into OS.  But the trouble with
that is it only allows me to do it one rezzed object at a time.  I have
close to 12,000 objects that need transferring...

     BTW, after reading a lot of forum posts on the Second Inventory site I
found many, many posts that indicated a lot of trouble with exporting
animations and gestures because of the nature of how they are incorporated
into SL and utilized.

     My only other cause for concern is the obvious fact that OpenSim is
still very much alphaware and from what I've seen multiple times already on
the Second Inventory forums is that any tiny change that takes place in
OpenSim as to how it manages inventory is cause for breakage in how Second
Inventory performs restorations of inventory.

     I'm getting the impression it's going to be a pot luck approach for the
time being by trying Second Inventory, Meerkat, and in some regards simply
rebuilding the objects in OpenSim.

     Second Life is now so well seasoned that it looks like the best forward
march (for me at least) will be to create exclusively in OpenSim and export
from there to import into Second Life, thus maintaining all original
creations locally in OpenSim for the least trouble in the long run...

&gt;<i> Hi

</I>&gt;<i> I don't know about gestures, but I know you can successfully use the
</I>&gt;<i> Meerkat viewer to move objects from SL to OpenSim.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Meerkat also allows you to copy objects that you have full permissions
</I>&gt;<i> on directly from Secondlife into Opensim. This is easily achieved by
</I>&gt;<i> logging into SL using Meerkat, right clicking on the object you wish
</I>&gt;<i> to copy choosing More&gt; More&gt; Backup from the round menu. Using the
</I>&gt;<i> Browse option, create a directory on your local hard drive where you
</I>&gt;<i> then save the objects xml description and texture. Change grid to
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim and choose viewer top toolbar menu File &gt; Import &gt; Upload
</I>&gt;<i> textures + Import. Load the object xml file from where you saved it
</I>&gt;<i> and the object magically appears in front of you in OpenSim :D
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Good luck
