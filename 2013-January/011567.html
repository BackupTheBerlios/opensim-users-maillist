<PRE>Thanks Tom,  I enjoyed that. Where are those Sun and Moon settings 
for star brightness?  Is it something in OpenSimDefaults.ini?

And thanks to Guy and Nebadon for the information.

I am using NVidia cards by the way... Nvidia Quadra 4500 1GB and 
Nvidia GTX 580 2GB.

I tried this again in a similar setting on a VCE region in OSGrid and 
on Second Life.. with the sun set to midnight, same size window, but 
using LL viewer for SL and Firestorm for OSGrid.

Second Life VCE region, Midnight, LL latest viewer

OSGrid/OpenSim VCE Region, Midnight, Firestorm latest OS viewer
<A HREF="http://www.aiai.ed.ac.uk/~bat/EXPORT/TEMP/OS-Stars.jpg">http://www.aiai.ed.ac.uk/~bat/EXPORT/TEMP/OS-Stars.jpg</A>

I think I am setting exactly the same &quot;shape&quot; on each viewer, but the 
SL one is half the size of the OSGrid/OpenSim one.  is there an 
OpenSim release setting that is perhaps set up a bit too big?

Funnily enough.. I was just watching the Doctor Who episode with 
Vincent van Gogh this evening :-)  Starry Starry night

</I>&gt;<i>You are right. I do not think that this is a problem though. I 
</I>&gt;<i>checked some photos of stars ... (Jodrell Bank) and shapes seem more 
</I>&gt;<i>realistic.

</I>&gt;<i>I fiddled with the environment editor under Sun and Moon Settings 
</I>&gt;<i>StrBrite. If I increase the star brightness in both SL and OS there 
</I>&gt;<i>comes a point where they look like shapes as per Ai's photo. OS 
</I>&gt;<i>looks a bit more shapely but it is difficult matching skies. I am 
</I>&gt;<i>using an NVIDIA GeForce GT 650M and Firestorm 4.3.1.31155 15-inch, 
</I>&gt;<i>Mid 2012 MBP. At 2.00 (nice dots) becoming more shapely with 
</I>&gt;<i>increasing brightness.

</I>&gt;<i>I have only seen this when using ATI ( radeon ) video cards. Are you 
</I>&gt;<i>using such?.. if so that is probably the reason the night sky looks wierd.

&gt;<i>From: Nebadon Izumi &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-users">nebadon2025 at gmail.com</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>I spoke to Linden Labs about this a long time ago, I believe this is 
</I>&gt;<i>a driver issue, do you get same results in Second Life, at the time 
</I>&gt;<i>I noticed this i was having same problem in SL and OpenSim, and one 
</I>&gt;<i>of the Lindens seemed somewhat unaware of the issue, and after 
</I>&gt;<i>asking others about it i recall the answer being its a driver 
</I>&gt;<i>problem with video cards. If you could test in Second Life that would be great.
