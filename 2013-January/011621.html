<PRE>Hi Laurent, et al,

I cannot answer your questions about &quot;the normal behavior when saving [an]
oar [file]...&quot;  However, like you, every time I upload an oar file, all of
the content includes my name only as the creator and owner.  In turn, as a
grateful user of all the creative commons and other freely shared content I
can find in different OpenSimulator grids, I am advocating a &quot;cornerstone
convention&quot; solution -- see the image at
<A HREF="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-odD2jgL2Fk4/UOMJpJ9ghEI/AAAAAAAAAbA/-1MGQUZSDAM/w497-h373/Cornerstone%2BProject%2B1.jpg">https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-odD2jgL2Fk4/UOMJpJ9ghEI/AAAAAAAAAbA/-1MGQUZSDAM/w497-h373/Cornerstone%2BProject%2B1.jpg</A>
.

More specifically, after reading Pam Broviak's recent blog post entitled,
&quot;How Much Credit Do You Have to Give?&quot; [to virtual world content creators
-- see
<A HREF="http://www.publicworksgroup.com/blog/2012/12/how-much-credit-do-you-have-to-give">http://www.publicworksgroup.com/blog/2012/12/how-much-credit-do-you-have-to-give</A>],
I was motivated to think about the best ways to give credit to the content
creators that generously share their work with others.  In turn, I came up
with three possible best practice ideas (see below):

(1)  Since the information in the &quot;Name&quot; text box and &quot;Description&quot; text
box on objects is always preserved (even when content is moved around via
OAR and IAR files), use these two boxes to identify the original creator(s)
of a virtual world build.

(2)  [If my own building experience is typical...]  Open source or creative
commons content items very quickly end up unlinked and accordingly,
disassociated from their &quot;root&quot; identifier prim/sculpty.  Accordingly,
using a transparent phantom cornerstone in the lower front left-hand corner
of a building or object could be one convention for identifying the origins
of builds and accompany content.

(3)  The further use of a note card in the cornerstone (in concert with a
note card giver script) would be a way to acknowledge the origin of
additional content in the build.

What do you think?  Is the &quot;Cornerstone Project&quot; [to establish a convention
for providing credit to the generous content creators in virtual worlds] a
viable solution?

Again, as the [low budget] &quot;chief cook and bottle washer&quot; for the nine
island grid I created to use in my e-teaching, having access to all of the
content various talented and generous OpenSim creators make available is
invaluable to me.  Accordingly, I would like to keep giving credit were
credit is due as well as hope to motivate even more content sharing.

Best,
Kay

</I>&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've noticed when loading the oar file of a backup, all objects were

</I>&gt;<i> creator and owner of objects ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've also seen about the &quot;--perm&quot; tag that :
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If the --perm option is specified then objects with insufficient
</I>&gt;<i> permissions will not be saved to the OAR. The user whose permissions are
</I>&gt;<i> checked is the estate owner. This can be useful for grids that allow their
</I>&gt;<i> customers to export their regions to OARs, because it ensures that
</I>&gt;<i> exporting to OAR can't be used to bypass content permissions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How is it possible ? I see no option in the ini files to force this
</I>&gt;<i> behavior, so it's up to the customers to use or not this flag.
