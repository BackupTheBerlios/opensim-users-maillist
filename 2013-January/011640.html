&gt;<i> Yeah --home was --profile up until 0.7.3.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I must admit, I haven't look at --home for a while but from what R.Gunther is saying it sounds like it works.  I believe it places the url (in this case <A HREF="http://www.osgrid.org">http://www.osgrid.org</A>) in the creator information - I don't know if it then appends anything else.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> From looking at [1], the original intention may have been to make this a link to each user's profile on the 'home' grid given.  However, I'm not sure if this work has reached a point where one could just use that URL to see the original user's profile, esp. as profile support seems rather sketchy atm.
</I>
The problem is that it remains an option and not a default behaviour. I'm asking you that because I have my own sim and that my friend is building on it. Last time I had to restore the sim with an oar archive, I've discovered that all the objects she had created were marked with me as creator. She tells me that she doesn't feel secure anymore building on an Opensim if the owner of the sim just need to make an oar backup to have him marked as the creator and owner of the objects she has done.
