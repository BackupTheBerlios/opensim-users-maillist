<PRE>I maintain the XmlRpcGroupsServer at [1].  Not in a particularly active fashion but I do maintain current functionality 
and as happy to look at any patches that people submit to that github project.  I can't comment on other versions of 
that code.

However, I don't think that the group IM attachment issue does not have anything to do with groups itself but is rather 
due to some bug in the way that OpenSimulator is handling attachments to these messages.  I'm assuming that it's broken 
- I haven't had a reason or an opportunity to take a look at that functionality myself.
