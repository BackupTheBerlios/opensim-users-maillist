<PRE>I am having problems with NPC's losing attachments. 

1. I create an appearance note card by having an avatar touch a &quot;Clone
yourself&quot; prim having a script with the line 
osAgentSaveAppearance(llDetectedKey(0), &quot;appearance&quot;); 

I open the prim and rename the resultant appearance note card and then save
it to my inventory. I can then drop this note card into another prim and
recreate the NPC controlled by that object using
npc = osNpcCreate(firstn, lastn, npcPos, renamednotecard);

Seems to work great if the model avatar is logged directly into the grid
when the note card is created. However if the avatar that i am modeling is
there via HyperGrid the attachments only seem to show up temporarily.
Clothing, shape and skin are still there when i recreate the npc but not
attachments.

So 
2. I see by looking at the xml of a note card that it appears that
attachments are listed by their attachment point and then identified by an
item key and an asset key. 
Can I edit the appearance card xml and add/modify attachments by reference
to something that i have in my inventory? (I can find an asset key by
looking at the item in my inventory but where would i find the 'item key'?
