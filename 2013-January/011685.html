<PRE>Hello all,

I'm running OpenSim commit fd34a75 (r/21883) and am noticing some 
oddness with playing and stopping animations. If I play an animation 
from inventory and then stop it, it will appear that my avatar is frozen 
in the last frame that was played before stopping instead of returning 
the avatar to the state that was in before the new animation was played. 
If I am playing and stopping animations from a script (such as an AO for 
instance); when the animation is stopped it will appear to keep playing 
until another animation is played after it. In both cases the weirdness 
with the stopped animation(s) will persist until some other animation is 
played whether it be another inventory animation or a default avatar 
movement animation. It doesn't seem to matter which animation is played 
from inventory / script.

For  a script it can sort of being worked around by doing this:

llStartAnimation(&quot;some_anim_name&quot;);

... Later on when it needs to be stopped ...

llStopAnimation(&quot;some_anim_name&quot;);
llStartAnimation(&quot;stand&quot;);
llStopAnimation(&quot;stand&quot;);

It gives the appearance that the animation is stopped; but I'm thinking 
that it's simply just overriding the stuck animation long enough to put 
a apply a new animation to the avatar to &quot;unstick&quot; it.

Its not an issue when the script plays one animation after another but 
if it's a one time animation that needs to be stopped the results can 
look really funny.

On a side note... I notice that when I attempt to play the same 
animation again with out first playing a different animation, the 
current playing animation won't appear to restart like it previously did 
not too long ago. I noticed this in my synced pose ball script that has 
a sync command which would simply play the poseball anim again when an 
avatar sat on it (sends a link message to other linked pose balls to 
tell them all to play the animation again) in attempt to sync up the 
animations of multiple avatars sitting on the link set.

Previously my sync function looked like this

sync()
{
     llStopAnimation(anim);
     llStartAnimation(anim);
}

Then had to change it to this once the animation issue started appearing 
to get it to work again

sync()
{
     llStopAnimation(anim);
     llStartAnimation(&quot;stand&quot;);
     llStopAnimation(&quot;stand&quot;);
     llStartAnimation(anim);
}

Is any one else experiencing this?

Thanks!
