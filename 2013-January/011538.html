<PRE>Thanks gang, I think I've pretty much got things configured the way I 
want them.  One individual region per section seems to work best for my 
needs.  Now, I'm off to the task of actually rebuilding all this stuff.  
Of course after I get my avatar pieced back together!  Luckily I found 
an old oar of Ellis, but yeesh does it ever look long in the tooth after 
all that time in storage.  Time to break out Blender and start meshing 
it all.  :)

I can't wait to get all of this done so I can ship it all off to a vps 
somewhere (or maybe look into shipping my old 2x quad core xeon (24 gig 
/ ram) 1U back to a colo) so others can visit!  Or, who knows - maybe by 
that point Ma Bell (AT&amp;T) will spring up off her walker and upgrade the 
antiquated dsl lines in my neighborhood so I may actually get some real 
bandwidth.  Yeesh, 11 years with 6mb down and .5mb up.  Talk about long 
in the tooth! :)

Thanks again, and I hope to maybe run into some of you while I'm out 
popping around the hypergrid!  :)
