<PRE>Okay so after a lot of annoying bugs and frustration, I finally got  
search, profiles, and offline messaging working.  Thanks to Guy for  
giving me that last push I needed to revisit it.

For those who are having trouble with the profiles, search, and  
offline messaging and are running on windows I recommend the following  
steps as it worked for me.

1. Install IIS (you can either install the IIS 7.5 express from  
Microsoft or activate IIS 6.0 through your control panel by going to  
the control panel and under programs turn on or off new features.  In  
the features manager check the boxes for IIS and click ok.)

2. Through the web installer from Microsoft you'll want to install php  
5.3.19 (sorry I am not to sure yet why profiles, search, and offline  
messaging hates php 5.4.x.  I'll try and play around with this when I  
get some time and through the list of projects I have waiting for me  
to implement.)

3. Go to your IIS Manager by clicking on start and typing in IIS  
Manager to find the manager.

4. In the IIS manager you might need to scroll down to find the php  
manager.  Open the manager.

5. In the php manager you might get an incompatibility highlighted in  
yellow.  No need to panic this is normal.  Click the recommended link  
next to this message and it will go away.

6. Click the php.ini link and edit the php.ini file and turn on  
asp_tags and short_open_tags.  Then click save.

7. Click the phpinfo link to verify that you have configured  
everything correctly.  No need to worry about the php_curl or  
php_xmlrpc as these are on by default. (they were for me).

8. Minimize your IIS manager now.

9. Copy the web root folders for search and profiles to your IIS  
wwwroot folder.  You can find this directory in C:\inetpub\wwwroot\

10. In my case I named the search, profile, and offline messaging  
directory folders search, profiles, and messaging.  I also changed the  
xmlrpc groups web root directory to groups.

11. Make sure to configure your database info and your ini files  
accordingly in your opensim server.

12. Restart or launch your opensim instance.

13. Log in using your viewer of choice and test.  Everything should  
work quite well.

I am sorry to see these modules not working well with the current php  
versions in wamp and xampp servers.  Someone will need to revisit that  
and figure out how to actually make these compatible with any  
php-xmlrpc version.

Thanks to Guy who gave me that bit of encouragement I needed and to  
Fleep/ Chris for posting his steps on his wiki.  Once I saw on Fleep's  
wiki that he had it working with IIS it got me thinking there might be  
a problem on windows with wamp and xampp server php-xmlrpc instances.

My next project is the economy modules for our grid and then  
addressing the issue relating to bigger region sizes.  Now that the  
developers of Firestorm are implementing the var regions, it is time I  
think to re address this.  I will let everyone know how this project  
turns out once I get to it in a day or two.  Currency comes first.

Emperor
