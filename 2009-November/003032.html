<PRE>Hi len thank you for responding,

I have done similar various tricks like mega prim boxes etc to achieve the appearance of another environment in Second life. But I could have sworn I read somewhere about (perhaps the realxtend folks?) using different void scapes in their sims with success.

I used to work in Unreal tournament community and in that environment we had a concept called environmental mapping which was to create a seperate area off of the main map (called coincedentally a skybox)&#160; in which you created your &quot;sky scene&quot; and placed a camera in the center of it. Then you would change the type of texture on your outer walls of your build to the environmental map and it would show you instead of a dead wall the scene which you created. with the camera as a central point of reference the scene would appear to move as you did much the way the moon &quot;appears&quot; to follow you in real life (which is actually just a matter of reletiveness and distance, smiles).

So I am hearing you say that this is a client factor which makes since. maybe the realxtend guys had experimented with their client and that is what I was seeing.

Still, imagine how amazing, powerful and cool this would be! I am kinda tired of the endless ocean expanse and would love to see a way to change this without boxing myself in. For me the problem is I like to camera around and look at the sim from a distance when building so once you step out side of the box it kinda ruin s the illusion.

be well.

Before mega-regions gave me an alternative, I was using a huge hollow cylinder 
around the perimeter of my sim with a landscape generated in povray pasted on 
the inside. It worked quite well as it was never intended to be viewed up 
close. Set it to phantom too as there was no need to touch it ever - it was 
actually out of the sim bounds so touching it was impossible anyway. It did 
wreck the minimap as it became a huge square covering everything.

I would LOVE to be able to change the void ocean level, though that is mostly 
a client-side issue. Customising the moon texture should also be possible but 
I have never been able to get my custom texture to take.

More on testing 0.6.7 postfixes (r11301). I am using a UGRM setup 
with R=AI and a number of regions all on same server.&#160; MySQL is DB in use.

I observe in the message server has a regular message every 5 minutes saying

[SERVER] Registered with <A HREF="http://virtual.aiai.ed.ac.uk:8002">http://virtual.aiai.ed.ac.uk:8002</A>

and that continues 3 or 4 times, then I get a red message

Unable to connect to server 
<A HREF="http://virtual.aiai.ed.ac.uk:8002.&#160;">http://virtual.aiai.ed.ac.uk:8002.&#160;</A> Server not running?

but after a while I see the successful register messages again. That 
has been happening in a soak test overnight all night.

At times I can connect both locally, and over a connection from 
outside the local network. , at others I cannot connect and see&#160; a 
user server message
[LOGIN] Region is not available for login. System.Net.WebException: 
the operation has time out.

I also see this morning that when a user client logs in or logs out I 
get a red message in the opensim,.exe console saying:

&#160; &#160; &#160; Failed to notify message server of agent leaving for &lt;UUID?

and the messaging server gives a red error saying:

&#160; &#160; &#160; Unable to connect to server <A HREF="http://virtual.aiai.ed.ac.uk:8002.&#160;">http://virtual.aiai.ed.ac.uk:8002.&#160;</A> Server n

At the same time there seem to be a number of data base connection 
lost and reconnecting errors in the Grid and message servers.

Anyone else having these sorts of problems with 0.6.7?&#160; My 0.6.6 
(r9903) system on which this is based was very stable and did not 
show these sorts of problems.
