+1 to what Diva says about contributing time and free stuff!!

</I>&gt;<i> +1 to donating to OSGrid.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Just want to make sure that there is no confusion here, as this thread 
</I>&gt;<i> is in *opensim*-users. The OpenSim project and OSGrid are two separate 
</I>&gt;<i> and independent things. OpenSim is... well OpenSim. OSgrid is an 
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim-based grid run by Adam, Nebadon, Charles and a few other 
</I>&gt;<i> volunteers. The people behind OSGrid are instrumental in testing the 
</I>&gt;<i> bleeding edge OpenSim, they are the frontline of large-scale OpenSim 
</I>&gt;<i> testing; but they are not the only testers.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The OpenSim project itself also takes donations, but we don't really 
</I>&gt;<i> value that kind of contribution. We value people's time best. You can 
</I>&gt;<i> find info about it in this obscure page:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Donations">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Donations</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Personal note: at this point, what I would value most coming from people 
</I>&gt;<i> who aren't programmers but who want to donate something to the OpenSim 
</I>&gt;<i> project would be free content -- avatars, clothes, etc.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      What brought the contribution issue to mind especially is that 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> until recently I had been paying Linden Lab for a full private region in 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Second Life.  And you may know those regions go for $295 per month (even 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;light use&quot; regions are $195 a month). That's a hefty chunk of change.  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Of course, now I use OpenSim almost exclusively and would be far more 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> willing now to pay a monthly contribution to this project rather than 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> continuing to breastfeed the Linden Lords.  :)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Last I heard they have around 300,000 regions they are feeding off of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> now.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks again and I'll be very happy to initiate a decent monthly 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> contribution soon if the contribution portion of the site gets updated 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and more properly managed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> BTW, you mentioned having to change the stats in several places on the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> site.  Is it not running on PHP or similar?  Even if it still had to be 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> manually entered into the database, surely drawing the stats for 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> contributions from a single database field would simplify matters.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I had a non-profit site for a few years and had a small bar meter graph 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in the header (on every page)  that relied on a field in the database.  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Once a week I entered that week's donations and expenses in and the bar 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> graph updated to reflect it.  It made sense because on that same day I 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> also spent donated money for hosting, supplies, etc so it was a fairly 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> simplistic process.  I then displayed what purchases I made as a simple 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pop up when the donation meter was clicked on.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I had a disclaimer, as you do, that I had authority to determine in what 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ways the donation was to be used, but by also displaying what I used it 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for then there was little question coming from donors.  I even had a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;back-pat allowance&quot; that I openly said was pocketed money for personal 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> enjoyment (generally 10-15% of the total donation amount monthly).  I 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> never had a single complaint, but I believe that was because I was 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> crystal clear from the start - if you disagreed with my use of donations 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> then you had the simple choice - not to donate.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks again Adam!

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Sorry about this &#8211; we switched it (or should have) recently over to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     a fixed message on the screen (may not have been put on the live
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     site yet, I believe Dave was supposed to be doing that?), since
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     tracking the donations turned out to require a manual count of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     subscriptions every time it needed to be updated (which naturally
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     resulted in it not getting done after a few months), and it needs to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     be updated in about fifteen different places on the site&#8217;s code.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     That said, I do think it is still a little shy of the target right
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     now, but we&#8217;re ahead of our costs which is good &#8211; I would like to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     prod Ckrinke (*prod prod*) to do some kind of news piece on the site
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     with just a quick update on where the fundraising efforts are going,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     and what the current donation levels are &#8211; we&#8217;re trying to hit a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     target of having about years operational fees in balance (which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     should be described on that page) which gives us a bit of long-term
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     security.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     If you are curious about what it&#8217;s being spent on &#8211; right now, I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     believe (and don&#8217;t quote me here, I&#8217;m not doing the books) we&#8217;re
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     slightly ahead of our current costs which are entirely consumed by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     server lease fees. We also had a couple of one-off expenses this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     year with paperwork filing fees in CA to get the registered
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     organisation wrapped up (and we&#8217;re formally applying for federal tax
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     exempt status this week &#8211; long process). If I had to guess based on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     the balance in the bank account; we&#8217;re taking in about $250/mo right
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     now, and our target is $300 (so 80% or thereabouts).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     We do also get a couple of one-off payments which we don&#8217;t count
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     towards the regular monthly commitments; we&#8217;ve had a couple of very
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     generous persons who have donated $100+ at a time; which we&#8217;re
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     putting into a rainy day fund that will be used to cover shortfalls
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     in other months (ie; if we have a month where donations is less than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     our costs, as has happened occasionally), or may be used in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     future to purchase new hardware (we are eyeballing replacing the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     current asset server with something more purpose built for the task.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Costs remain right now at $160/mo + one-offs; so the donations are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     still much appreciated &#8211; once we hit that magic $300/mo, we want to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     go ahead and buy a second UGIM server to act as a hot-backup to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     current systems (since right now our regular backup is in Nebadon&#8217;s
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     basement &#8211; and not really ideal if we ever need to do a big restore
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     like in January.) &#8211; this is non-essential for the grid operations,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     but we do want to insure ourselves against catastrophic hardware
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     failure and has been a priority to setup hopefully sometime this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> year.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     In addition to the donations, there are also the sponsors &#8211; OSgrid
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     is sponsored to a fairly considerable tune by people who have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     donated dedicated servers to the grid. The electric sheep company
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     provides our central database &amp; UGIM server right now, Dave
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Coyle/Knifejaw Systems provide a fairly powerful box that hosts LBSA
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Plaza &amp; others; DeepThink (disclaimer, I&#8217;m part of D.T.) donates two
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     boxes which host the remaining plazas (inc. Wright) [which deepthink
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     recently just upgraded].
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     As mentioned on the site &#8211; OSgrid is a registered nonprofit, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     while the above may paint a somewhat rosy position; in absolute
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     terms it is still only ~$250 per month; and we desperately want to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     both; a) have savings for a rainy day (e.g.; a critical machine
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     fails &amp; needs replacing), and b) purchase some new equipment from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     time to time to expand our services when possible; which means that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     every donation is very-much appreciated &#8211; and it can be assured
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     we&#8217;re doing our best to keep our costs down &amp; not wasting any funds
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     we receive.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     With all the above said, the opensim-users list isn&#8217;t really the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     place for osgrid specific discussion (#osgrid on freenode is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     probably the proper place) &#8211; but I hope I answered any questions or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     concerns you might have about the donations &amp; where they go.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     I just noticed this on their donations page:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     &quot;*Current Status:* $50.00/mo pledged. (Last updated: 11:36PM PST,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Monday 20th July 2009)&quot;

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     That is quite interesting as well.  I don't see how they come to the

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> $250.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Hi!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>          I've been wanting to make a monthly donation to OSGrid.org but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     for the last several months (as far back as I can recall) the site
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     has shown a static &quot;Funding at 58% of Target&quot; and not changed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     whatsoever.  I find that extremely hard to believe.  Is OSGrid
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     simply lying and maintaining that 58% donation figure for months on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     end to compel people to donate?  for all I know at this point, they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     may be receiving thousands in donations per month, but of course,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     without transparency, that is impossible to identify.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         I regularly donate money to open source projects I have an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     interest in, but only when their donation requests are transparent
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     and clear.  On OSGrid's donation page, they state their target is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     $250.00 per month.  I just find it very hard to believe that, with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     the thousands of users and connected regions they are still only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     getting about $150 per month without any changes in that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     contribution level all through the summer and fall.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>          I have the suspicion that others who would like to donate as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     well are turned off by the seemingly forever static contribution
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     coverage percentage.  If I saw even a little fluctuation I'd at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     least know there is some variability in contributions and I'd not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     hesitate to offer a monthly contribution via PayPal.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>          Heck, even if they said that contributions were at 100% but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     that they could always make use of more money, even if for personal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     compensation to those working on the project, I'd not have the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     slightest problem with that.  I have no reservations about making a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     donation that the recipient pockets - as long as they are actively
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     contributing to the project in some manner.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>          But for now I'm donating my money to other groups while
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     OSGrid.org maintains their contributions as only 58% of their meager
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     $250/month goal...
