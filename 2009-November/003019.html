<PRE>Sounds like a timezone conflict between where your server thinks it is
and where your client thinks you are when it converts to human-readable
time.

 

The number in the database is Epoch time which means the time is nice
and universal and timezone-independant:

Hope that helps,

Chris

Subject: [Opensim-users] How is &quot;Date/Time&quot; Recorded in the Database?

 

Hi Everyone!

 

     Do any of you know how OpenSim saves time in the database?

 

     Here's the situation - I started a brand new fully updated
&quot;bleeding edge&quot; OpenSim server at home on November 1st.  The region
shows it was created on Nov 1st but after creating a new skin, shape,
etc for my new avatar - I noticed my avatar profile says it was created
on November 2nd.

 

     In the database for my avatar is the following: 1257137090 to
represent when the avatar was created.  I suppose I could make the
number slightly smaller in the database and see what happens, but if
there is some &quot;basic and simple&quot; means that the current date is encoded,
what is it?  I want my avatar to also show a birthday of November 1,
like the region it's building...

 

Any hints?

 

Thanks!

 

- Len W. Brown
