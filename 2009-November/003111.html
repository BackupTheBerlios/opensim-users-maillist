<PRE>Hello everyone

Everybody interested, can have a look at the git branch of Adam Frisby's PayPal money module, that I have created:
    <A HREF="http://github.com/SnoopyPfeffer/DTL-PayPal">http://github.com/SnoopyPfeffer/DTL-PayPal</A>

I have implemented the following functional extensions and bug fixes:
- User2User pay, User2Object pay, User2Object purchases and User2Land purchases work properly, now
- User2User payments are confirmed with instant messages to senders and receivers
-
Support for group owned objects and land can be enabled (default: off);
requirement: PayPal email accounts have to be defined per group
- Underscores in email addresses do not cause error messages during opensim
startup anymore
- Object and land purchases for US$ 0 do not initiate a PayPal transaction anymore
- Object purchases properly transfer the purchased contents to the buyer, now
-
User email addresses are loaded from the local ini file; invalid email adresses are ignored, but loading is not aborted anymore
- User
email addresses can also be fetched from the Users grid service, if
that feature is enabled (default: off); fetched email addresses are
cached by the region server until region restart; local email addresses
always take precedence, to ensure an acceptable level of security
- Locally defined user email addresses should be used
for all users that receive bigger amounts of money within a region
(i.e. shop owners); the reason is the much higher security, if these email
addresses are not fetched from the Users grid service; beside that it
is possible to locally use a special PalPal micropayment account for
all shop transactions to save fees, instead of a standard PayPal
account used elsewhere
-
Group email addresses can be defined per group UUID in the local ini
file to support group owned objects and land as mentioned before
-
Non existent user or group email addresses are handled by showing
warning messages, instead of error messages for crashed code
- Added start and success log messages for all kinds of PayPal transactions
- Rounding problems made it impossible to pay certain amounts (like US$ 1.23); now all amounts work and are displayed nicely

Interesting findings:
-
PayPal can send money to all email accounts, even to email accounts not
registered at PayPal yet; thus it is not necessary to handle that case
- PayPal micropayment accounts are not available in all countries worldwide

The following still needs to be done:
- Web pages that are shown after successful or cancelled PayPal transactions
- Locking for PayPal transactions while buying land or original objects
- Events or functions that allow to lock vendors while a PayPal transaction is in progress
- Too small amounts that do not cover the PayPal transaction fees produce a misleading error message on the PayPal web page; maybe it would be good to be able to define a minimum amount globally and/or per email address to avoid that
- It would be good if a scripter using llGiveMoney gets a warning message, that this function is not supported by the PayPal money module
- User2User payments are confirmed with instant messages to the sender
and receiver of money, but only if these users are online at that time;
maybe it is possible to improve that, so that even users offline get
such confirmation messages as stored offline messages

Installation of the PayPal money module:
- Install the addon-modules/dtl-paypal under OpenSim/Region/OptionalModules/
- Install the files for bin dir in the OpenSim bin folder
- Add the addtional config settings in config-include in bin/OpenSim.ini
- After that compile OpenSim

Snoopy
