<PRE>Thank you so much Adam!  I really appreicate you taking the time to detail
these things for me.

     What brought the contribution issue to mind especially is that until
recently I had been paying Linden Lab for a full private region in Second
Life.  And you may know those regions go for $295 per month (even &quot;light
use&quot; regions are $195 a month). That's a hefty chunk of change.  Of course,
now I use OpenSim almost exclusively and would be far more willing now to
pay a monthly contribution to this project rather than continuing to
breastfeed the Linden Lords.  :)

Last I heard they have around 300,000 regions they are feeding off of now.

Thanks again and I'll be very happy to initiate a decent monthly
contribution soon if the contribution portion of the site gets updated and
more properly managed.

BTW, you mentioned having to change the stats in several places on the
site.  Is it not running on PHP or similar?  Even if it still had to be
manually entered into the database, surely drawing the stats for
contributions from a single database field would simplify matters.

I had a non-profit site for a few years and had a small bar meter graph in
the header (on every page)  that relied on a field in the database.  Once a
week I entered that week's donations and expenses in and the bar graph
updated to reflect it.  It made sense because on that same day I also spent
donated money for hosting, supplies, etc so it was a fairly simplistic
process.  I then displayed what purchases I made as a simple pop up when the
donation meter was clicked on.

I had a disclaimer, as you do, that I had authority to determine in what
ways the donation was to be used, but by also displaying what I used it for
then there was little question coming from donors.  I even had a &quot;back-pat
allowance&quot; that I openly said was pocketed money for personal enjoyment
(generally 10-15% of the total donation amount monthly).  I never had a
single complaint, but I believe that was because I was crystal clear from
the start - if you disagreed with my use of donations then you had the
simple choice - not to donate.

Thanks again Adam!

- Len

</I>&gt;<i> on the site&#8217;s code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That said, I do think it is still a little shy of the target right now, but

</I>&gt;<i> levels are &#8211; we&#8217;re trying to hit a target of having about years operational
</I>&gt;<i> fees in balance (which should be described on that page) which gives us a
</I>&gt;<i> bit of long-term security.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you are curious about what it&#8217;s being spent on &#8211; right now, I believe
</I>&gt;<i> (and don&#8217;t quote me here, I&#8217;m not doing the books) we&#8217;re slightly ahead of
</I>&gt;<i> our current costs which are entirely consumed by server lease fees. We also
</I>&gt;<i> had a couple of one-off expenses this year with paperwork filing fees in CA
</I>&gt;<i> to get the registered organisation wrapped up (and we&#8217;re formally applying
</I>&gt;<i> for federal tax exempt status this week &#8211; long process). If I had to guess
</I>&gt;<i> based on the balance in the bank account; we&#8217;re taking in about $250/mo
</I>&gt;<i> right now, and our target is $300 (so 80% or thereabouts).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We do also get a couple of one-off payments which we don&#8217;t count towards
</I>&gt;<i> the regular monthly commitments; we&#8217;ve had a couple of very generous persons
</I>&gt;<i> who have donated $100+ at a time; which we&#8217;re putting into a rainy day fund
</I>&gt;<i> that will be used to cover shortfalls in other months (ie; if we have a
</I>&gt;<i> month where donations is less than our costs, as has happened occasionally),
</I>&gt;<i> or may be used in the future to purchase new hardware (we are eyeballing
</I>&gt;<i> replacing the current asset server with something more purpose built for the
</I>&gt;<i> task.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Costs remain right now at $160/mo + one-offs; so the donations are still
</I>&gt;<i> much appreciated &#8211; once we hit that magic $300/mo, we want to go ahead and
</I>&gt;<i> buy a second UGIM server to act as a hot-backup to the current systems
</I>&gt;<i> (since right now our regular backup is in Nebadon&#8217;s basement &#8211; and not
</I>&gt;<i> really ideal if we ever need to do a big restore like in January.) &#8211; this is
</I>&gt;<i> non-essential for the grid operations, but we do want to insure ourselves
</I>&gt;<i> against catastrophic hardware failure and has been a priority to setup
</I>&gt;<i> hopefully sometime this year.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In addition to the donations, there are also the sponsors &#8211; OSgrid is
</I>&gt;<i> sponsored to a fairly considerable tune by people who have donated dedicated
</I>&gt;<i> servers to the grid. The electric sheep company provides our central
</I>&gt;<i> database &amp; UGIM server right now, Dave Coyle/Knifejaw Systems provide a
</I>&gt;<i> fairly powerful box that hosts LBSA Plaza &amp; others; DeepThink (disclaimer,
</I>&gt;<i> I&#8217;m part of D.T.) donates two boxes which host the remaining plazas (inc.
</I>&gt;<i> Wright) [which deepthink recently just upgraded].
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As mentioned on the site &#8211; OSgrid is a registered nonprofit, and while the
</I>&gt;<i> above may paint a somewhat rosy position; in absolute terms it is still only
</I>&gt;<i> ~$250 per month; and we desperately want to both; a) have savings for a
</I>&gt;<i> rainy day (e.g.; a critical machine fails &amp; needs replacing), and b)
</I>&gt;<i> purchase some new equipment from time to time to expand our services when
</I>&gt;<i> possible; which means that every donation is very-much appreciated &#8211; and it
</I>&gt;<i> can be assured we&#8217;re doing our best to keep our costs down &amp; not wasting any
</I>&gt;<i> funds we receive.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With all the above said, the opensim-users list isn&#8217;t really the place for
</I>&gt;<i> osgrid specific discussion (#osgrid on freenode is probably the proper
</I>&gt;<i> place) &#8211; but I hope I answered any questions or concerns you might have
</I>&gt;<i> about the donations &amp; where they go.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      I've been wanting to make a monthly donation to OSGrid.org but for the
</I>&gt;<i> last several months (as far back as I can recall) the site has shown a
</I>&gt;<i> static &quot;Funding at 58% of Target&quot; and not changed whatsoever.  I find that
</I>&gt;<i> extremely hard to believe.  Is OSGrid simply lying and maintaining that 58%
</I>&gt;<i> donation figure for months on end to compel people to donate?  for all I
</I>&gt;<i> know at this point, they may be receiving thousands in donations per month,
</I>&gt;<i> but of course, without transparency, that is impossible to identify.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I regularly donate money to open source projects I have an interest in,
</I>&gt;<i> but only when their donation requests are transparent and clear.  On
</I>&gt;<i> OSGrid's donation page, they state their target is $250.00 per month.  I
</I>&gt;<i> just find it very hard to believe that, with the thousands of users and
</I>&gt;<i> connected regions they are still only getting about $150 per month without
</I>&gt;<i> any changes in that contribution level all through the summer and fall.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      I have the suspicion that others who would like to donate as well are
</I>&gt;<i> turned off by the seemingly forever static contribution coverage
</I>&gt;<i> percentage.  If I saw even a little fluctuation I'd at least know there is
</I>&gt;<i> some variability in contributions and I'd not hesitate to offer a monthly
</I>&gt;<i> contribution via PayPal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      Heck, even if they said that contributions were at 100% but that they
</I>&gt;<i> could always make use of more money, even if for personal compensation to
</I>&gt;<i> those working on the project, I'd not have the slightest problem with that.
</I>&gt;<i> I have no reservations about making a donation that the recipient pockets -
</I>&gt;<i> as long as they are actively contributing to the project in some manner.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      But for now I'm donating my money to other groups while OSGrid.org
</I>&gt;<i> maintains their contributions as only 58% of their meager $250/month goal...
