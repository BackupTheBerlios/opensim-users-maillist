<PRE>Thanks for the explanation nlin. For me (on 0.6.7-post-fixes), tilted=false 
solved the bendy knee issue and the feet partially underground issue, 
although everyone now seems to float slightly above the ground.

I'll keep a lookout for the other two issues you mention.

Subject: Re: [Opensim-users] Changed default av_capsule_tilted to false 
inOpenSim master

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2009/11/10, Justin Clark-Casey &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-users">jjustincc at googlemail.com</A>&gt;:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There was a bit of discussion last week in the OpenSim dev's office hour 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> irc that changing av_capsule_tilted = false in OpenSim.ini.example would 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> good idea in the master branch for avatar related physics for ODE.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The av_capsule_tilted=false should generally be safe. Please let me
</I>&gt;<i> mention some general things to watch out for. These shouldn't be a
</I>&gt;<i> problem now, but were problems that I encountered and hopefully fixed:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Avatar falling through terrain
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Extremely rapid changes of direction and movement could conceivably
</I>&gt;<i> cause the avatar capsule to become unstable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note that these items are refer to poor behavior in terms of the
</I>&gt;<i> physics engine itself (visualized with drawstuff), as opposed to ways
</I>&gt;<i> that poor behavior might manifest itself in the viewer (such as
</I>&gt;<i> bendy-knees).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regarding 1, terrain collisions, reducing the avatar tilt seems to
</I>&gt;<i> increase the tendency of the avatar to fall through the terrain - this
</I>&gt;<i> has something to do with the ODE terrain collider, which I wasn't able
</I>&gt;<i> to fully debug - anyone wanting to give it a shot, let me know. As a
</I>&gt;<i> workaround, currently a small, experimentally-determined tilt is
</I>&gt;<i> maintained (even with tilt=false) to prevent falling through the
</I>&gt;<i> terrain. This isn't ideal, but seems to work well enough.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regarding 2, rapid changing of avatar direction: The tilt rotates with
</I>&gt;<i> the avatar, snapped in 90-degree increments to one of  four directions
</I>&gt;<i> (NE,NW,SE,SW), so that the direction of the tilt always is opposite
</I>&gt;<i> the direction of movement. In other words, if your avatar is moving
</I>&gt;<i> forwards, the avatar is leaning slightly backwards. The reason the
</I>&gt;<i> tilt is rotated with the avatar is to reduce/remove
</I>&gt;<i> direction-dependent behavior, such as being only able to climb over
</I>&gt;<i> prims from a certain direction. The reason the tilt rotation is
</I>&gt;<i> snapped to 90-degree increments, instead of smoothly rotating with the
</I>&gt;<i> avatar, is to prevent extremely rapid changes in tilt orientation,
</I>&gt;<i> which is done by setting ODE motor stops. If you change ODE motor
</I>&gt;<i> stops too rapidly, the avatar capsule may &quot;explode&quot; and go flying
</I>&gt;<i> several hundred meters into the air. Conceivably, if your avatar
</I>&gt;<i> walked directly straddling a line facing northeast and constantly did
</I>&gt;<i> a zig-zag motion above and below the NE line, this could cause the
</I>&gt;<i> avatar orientation to change rapidly enough to cause avatar
</I>&gt;<i> instability. In practice I doubt that this will be an issue. (Still,
</I>&gt;<i> would be interesting to write a bot to try to provoke this behavior.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> More generally, however, this dynamically rotating tilt is not ideal.
</I>&gt;<i> I think there are 2 avatar physics issues that need further
</I>&gt;<i> investigation:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Removing the tilt completely instead of just reducing it. Currently
</I>&gt;<i> not workable because the terrain collider then allows the avatar
</I>&gt;<i> capsule to fall through sometimes. Fixing this would allow complete
</I>&gt;<i> consistency (direction-independence) in avatar physics behavior, close
</I>&gt;<i> avatar interactions like hugging, and no need for changing the motor
</I>&gt;<i> stops while the avatar is moving, reducing risk of explosion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Allowing flexible height of steps that the avatar can step over.
</I>&gt;<i> Currently the bottom-most hemisphere of the avatar capsule always
</I>&gt;<i> drags against the terrain or any objects it collides with. This has
</I>&gt;<i> the limitation that the height of obstacles that can successfully be
</I>&gt;<i> stepped over cannot be directly tuned, as it depends indirectly on the
</I>&gt;<i> size of the hemisphere and the specifics of collision handling (things
</I>&gt;<i> like ERP, CFM, bounce). Ideally we would want to be able to directly
</I>&gt;<i> tune the height of &quot;steppable&quot; objects in OpenSim.ini, or perhaps have
</I>&gt;<i> this be different per avatar (dependent e.g. on the avatar height).
</I>&gt;<i> But it looks like we would probably have to implement a new avatar
</I>&gt;<i> physics mechanism to handle this flexibly: something like a floating
</I>&gt;<i> capsule, capsule+sphere, or using mesh collisions instead of primitive
</I>&gt;<i> capsules.
</I>&gt;<i>
