<PRE>Hi!

     I've been wanting to make a monthly donation to OSGrid.org but for the
last several months (as far back as I can recall) the site has shown a
static &quot;Funding at 58% of Target&quot; and not changed whatsoever.  I find that
extremely hard to believe.  Is OSGrid simply lying and maintaining that 58%
donation figure for months on end to compel people to donate?  for all I
know at this point, they may be receiving thousands in donations per month,
but of course, without transparency, that is impossible to identify.

    I regularly donate money to open source projects I have an interest in,
but only when their donation requests are transparent and clear.  On
OSGrid's donation page, they state their target is $250.00 per month.  I
just find it very hard to believe that, with the thousands of users and
connected regions they are still only getting about $150 per month without
any changes in that contribution level all through the summer and fall.

     I have the suspicion that others who would like to donate as well are
turned off by the seemingly forever static contribution coverage
percentage.  If I saw even a little fluctuation I'd at least know there is
some variability in contributions and I'd not hesitate to offer a monthly
contribution via PayPal.

     Heck, even if they said that contributions were at 100% but that they
could always make use of more money, even if for personal compensation to
those working on the project, I'd not have the slightest problem with that.
I have no reservations about making a donation that the recipient pockets -
as long as they are actively contributing to the project in some manner.

     But for now I'm donating my money to other groups while OSGrid.org
maintains their contributions as only 58% of their meager $250/month goal...
