Yes, using normal meshes in the Ogre format has been working in reX for 
2 years now.

First in the quick prototype, which was modified SLviewer where Ogre was 
added, and a modified (fork) OpenSim which could store meshes and 
materials etc. For about 6 months now the production version of the 
server has been unmodified OpenSim with the ModRex plugin adding the 
extensions that mesh support needs.

The production viewer is still the prototype that uses both SLviewer and 
Ogre code, and due to how it switches opengl contexts on the fly it 
requires good opengl drivers (has always worked on nvidia and at least 
nowadays on ati too, but afaik not in Intel). Also although it uses 
cross-platform technologies, the build system etc. were not 
cross-platform, so people have been running it on Linux via WINE only. 
But some folks for whom it works have been using it to build etc quite a 
lot.

The new viewer is quite ok under way, writing it started in March and 
0.0.2 preview pre-alpha was released about two weeks ago. Uses only Ogre 
for drawing so works basically anywhere (either d3d or opengl, e.g. 
intel integrated cards in laptops), and cross-platformness is a 
requirement so builds on Linux too (and should on Mac). Renders scenes 
ok and has basic UI for chat and inventory now, info &amp; screenshots at: 
<A HREF="http://wiki.realxtend.org/index.php/Getting_Started_with_Naali">http://wiki.realxtend.org/index.php/Getting_Started_with_Naali</A> .

We're planning the first actually usable release candidate by the end of 
the year, beginning of next year then bugfixes &amp; polish for that for 
first production release. Then continue to add missing &amp; new features 
next year. Please anyone who is interested give 0.0.2 a shot now and 
report back if there are probs (there is one known stupid bug: crashes 
on vista with UAC on, doesn't have permissions to write user name to a 
file in the user home dir - has been fixed in trunk, but if you get that 
you can run 0.0.2 as admin). At least if you have a powerful machine you 
can log-in to osgrid or whatever (the amount of prims there is a lot for 
the unoptimized prim rendering code in Naali - places made with meshes 
typically have much less objects so are lighter).

&gt;<i> For example I have almost 10 years of content that I have generated with Poser and similar tools which I would be delighted to move to OpenSim!
</I>&gt;<i> Much of my Poser generated content could be shared with the community.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
I think there's no reason to wait with that if you want, we could 
experiment with some of those models etc. straight away. There are reX 
demo scenes etc. and also our company has things we've made in Blender 
for Ogre games before, but different kinds of content from folks with 
different usage ideas etc. would be interesting.

Oh and also the Idealist viewer (and the 3di browser plugin that uses 
it) has reX-compatible(?) mesh support? And as Linden has been 
experimenting with that too, is interesting to see if they actually take 
it to production use. I hope everyone does and we get interoperability 
and standards - the basics of meshes have been the same for so long now 
(15 years?) that seems that there's a change.

You are right that there are issues, but also working and even mature 
technology that we can use today to get started.
