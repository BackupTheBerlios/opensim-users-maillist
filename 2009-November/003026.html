<PRE>Before mega-regions gave me an alternative, I was using a huge hollow cylinder 
around the perimeter of my sim with a landscape generated in povray pasted on 
the inside. It worked quite well as it was never intended to be viewed up 
close. Set it to phantom too as there was no need to touch it ever - it was 
actually out of the sim bounds so touching it was impossible anyway. It did 
wreck the minimap as it became a huge square covering everything.

I would LOVE to be able to change the void ocean level, though that is mostly 
a client-side issue. Customising the moon texture should also be possible but 
I have never been able to get my custom texture to take.
