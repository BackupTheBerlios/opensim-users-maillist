<PRE>I just noticed this on their donations page:

&quot;*Current Status:* $50.00/mo pledged. (Last updated: 11:36PM PST, Monday
20th July 2009)&quot;

That is quite interesting as well.  I don't see how they come to the
conclusion that a $50 donation pledge is &quot;58% of Target&quot; which is $250.

&gt;<i> Hi!

</I>&gt;<i>      I've been wanting to make a monthly donation to OSGrid.org but for the
</I>&gt;<i> last several months (as far back as I can recall) the site has shown a
</I>&gt;<i> static &quot;Funding at 58% of Target&quot; and not changed whatsoever.  I find that
</I>&gt;<i> extremely hard to believe.  Is OSGrid simply lying and maintaining that 58%
</I>&gt;<i> donation figure for months on end to compel people to donate?  for all I
</I>&gt;<i> know at this point, they may be receiving thousands in donations per month,
</I>&gt;<i> but of course, without transparency, that is impossible to identify.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I regularly donate money to open source projects I have an interest in,
</I>&gt;<i> but only when their donation requests are transparent and clear.  On
</I>&gt;<i> OSGrid's donation page, they state their target is $250.00 per month.  I
</I>&gt;<i> just find it very hard to believe that, with the thousands of users and
</I>&gt;<i> connected regions they are still only getting about $150 per month without
</I>&gt;<i> any changes in that contribution level all through the summer and fall.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      I have the suspicion that others who would like to donate as well are
</I>&gt;<i> turned off by the seemingly forever static contribution coverage
</I>&gt;<i> percentage.  If I saw even a little fluctuation I'd at least know there is
</I>&gt;<i> some variability in contributions and I'd not hesitate to offer a monthly
</I>&gt;<i> contribution via PayPal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      Heck, even if they said that contributions were at 100% but that they
</I>&gt;<i> could always make use of more money, even if for personal compensation to
</I>&gt;<i> those working on the project, I'd not have the slightest problem with that.
</I>&gt;<i> I have no reservations about making a donation that the recipient pockets -
</I>&gt;<i> as long as they are actively contributing to the project in some manner.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      But for now I'm donating my money to other groups while OSGrid.org
</I>&gt;<i> maintains their contributions as only 58% of their meager $250/month goal...
