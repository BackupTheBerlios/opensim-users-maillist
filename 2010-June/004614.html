<PRE>Yes LaeMing I agree with you.

FWIW the Tshirts etc. that I am making with your images (and more with my
own images BTW) will also be freely licensed and distributed, my only
concern is that they NOT be imported or used in Second Life! Mostly because
I am sure that would stir up accusations of copying, however baseless.

With my background in IP law I tend to a formal BSD style license, but the
essential thing is to have some statement that users and distributors can
rely on.

We often seem to lose sight of the fact that the entire justification for
all IP laws worldwide is to increase creativity and innovation.

In fact the very first IP law was made by King James of England who declared
&quot;Anyone may have exclusive use of an invention, for a time, provided the
teach an Englishman the art.&quot;

His motivation was to break the stranglehold that the European Guilds
(mostly Dutch and French) held over virtually all English production of the
day.

Very similar to the present day situation in many ways.

One reason that virtual world fashions tend to be much fancier than real
life though is that virtual clothes don't get dirty or tangled in things!
Anyone who has raised children (both boys AND girls) knows exactly what I
mean. :-)
