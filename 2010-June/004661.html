<PRE>Don't mean to revive a 4 month old thread but I have come across a couple findings regarding this issue.

If I run the OpenSim server, MySQL, and the viewer all on the same computer I do not have any trouble with uploads
and the data persisting to the database.

However, if I run OpenSim and MySQL on one computer (under Windows XP 32-Bit, or Windows 7 32-Bit)
run the viewer on a different computer, and try to upload textures, sounds, animations, and etc;
about half of the time it will exhibit the behavior explained below in the original message.

If I upload data to OS and it turns out to be a bad upload (you can tell because it will take anywhere from 5 - 10 seconds to
complete each upload instead of being almost instant i.e. 1 - 2 seconds) the data will be there until the server is shutdown
and restarted.

With this in mind, I decided to make an IAR backup of the assets that were &quot;bad&quot; (before restarting the server)
just to see if the data would actually be included in the backup. Much to my surprise, the assets were actually there
and presumably if I restored that IAR, it would restore the assets properly to the database.

Just thought I would share these findings with anyone who might be trying to work out a fix for this.


Thank you for the awesome work on OpenSim! =)



--- Original Message ---

I am having trouble with uploading animations, textures, sounds, etc to OpenSim when running it under Windows.
About a third to half of the time I upload anything to OpenSim, it takes a few seconds longer than usual to upload
the data (especially noticable when performing a bulk upload of said data). That in itself isn't too worrisome to me,
but, if I log off OpenSim, shut the server down using the 'quit' command and restart it, and log back into OpenSim,
the data that I uploaded appears to be gone. The inventory objects referring to the data appears to still be in inventory,
but the data that it refers to on the asset server seems to be null and void.

For instance, if I uploaded a few (say 10 to 20) textures with the bulk import command, log off, shut down and restart the server, and log back in;
I can still see that the textures I uploaded are still apparently in my inventory, but if I try to open them to view the textures, all
it gives me is a blank white texture that is 256x256 in size. Same goes for animations and sounds that don't appear to upload
correctly; except the animations won't play and the sounds won't play if it was a &quot;bad&quot; upload. I've tried clearing my viewer cache and relogging,
but the data is still gone.

I can tell it will be a bad upload when using bulk because it takes quite a few seconds longer per file to upload than usual.
The server output seems to be normal in that it is acknowledging that it is receiving the uploaded data... But the persistance of
it seems to be gone about a third to half of the time I upload data. I can access the data that was uploaded perfectly fine... as long as I
do not log off and/or restart the server. Other times the data will persist fine between logging and/or restarting the server (this is characterized
by the data uploading at a quick and steady pace rather than hesitating between each upload).

I've double checked my MySQL, OpenSim.ini, and also my Cenome Cache settings, every thing seems to be in working order.
I am using the same settings in the server I run on Linux32 with Mono and uploads do not exhibit this strange behaviour with Linux.
Have not changed any settings in MySQL except for the Max Packet Size which I changed from 1 MB to 16 MB to allow database
backup and restore.

Specs for my Windows OS installation:
OpenSim git revision r12198 (have tried others as well) on .NET Framework
Windows 7 32-Bit
2.5 GB Ram
AMD Athlon Dual Core @ 1.6 Ghz
MySQL 5.1 for database
