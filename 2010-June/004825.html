<PRE>What is the behavior for

      fcache assets

I want to cache all assets in 14 regions ahead of doing a save oar to 
avoid any asset lookup problems during the backups.  I see that 
fcache assets returns immediately, and the command reports its 
completion later. But I ma getting suspicious (wrong - Completed 
Scene Caching, 832 assets found) assets numbers all the same... even 
though I do a change region ahead of each fcache assets.

Does fcache assets work only on the current region?

How can I wait until each completes before carrying on when doing a 
command-script script run?
