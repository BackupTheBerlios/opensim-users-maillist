&gt;<i> The sad fact of the matter is this...   If you open your grid to the

</I>&gt;<i> step-by-step procedures
</I>
DMCA is a very US law, and few other parts of the world have yet any 
similar laws. Thats why the US press so hard in the ACTA negotiation for 
having that added. The proper way in Sweden here is for the person that 
have the copied item to either make a criminal case by making talking to 
the nearest police station. Or a civil case, sending in a request to the 
court to order the operator to give out the personal information they 
have on someone. The courts have also made changed many see as against 
the EU registrations to take down bandwith to the site PirateBay. The 
ISP have taken this to a sigher court instance so what that wil end in 
is not sure yet.

In fact a ISP or grid operator is regulated to be not allowed to do some 
parts om the US DMCA laws unless a court takes the decition. They are 
not allowed to give out any information about there customers. They are 
not allowed to keep eccessive logs not needed for billing and so on.

In the end the legal ways varried greatly with WHERE you are operating.

Would I have a grid, a user agreement written wel may give me the right 
to take down users content when a creator asks me. I have no 
&quot;obligations&quot; until he court orders me. The situations is totally 
different here.
