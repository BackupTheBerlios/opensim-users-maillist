</I>&gt;&gt;<i> no intentions of connecting to it.  My personal project lets personal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> friends of mine come and enjoy a tour of Shuri Castle during the time of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> King Sho nei.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, groups do work with a standalone. Just yesterday, I have set up 
</I>&gt;<i> the flotsam XmlRpcGroups implementation for my standalone which also 
</I>&gt;<i> uses a OpenSim 0.6.9 binary distribution provided by OSGrid.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ok, I don't seem to have any other troubles, my friends log in fine and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so do I.  I don't loose anything but between shutting down and coming
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> back up some worn items have to be reattached.  I logged into flotsom
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and downloaded what I thought I needed from them the php files and all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that.  But once I get how I think they tell me to set it up done, I turn
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on the group in the opensim.ini and all I get are errors, and even after
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pointing to my own xmlrpc.php in my xampp/htdocs/groups dir via http
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> address one of the errors I get say it is trying to use something to do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with OSGrid.  Oh and quits while apparently trying to find the user in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the user database.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Have you followed the installation instructions at 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/flotsam/wiki/XmlRpcGroups?">http://code.google.com/p/flotsam/wiki/XmlRpcGroups?</A> You do not need to 
</I>&gt;<i> care about the OpenSim module because it is already part of the 
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim distribution.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So it started making me think before I continue maybe I misunderstood
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with all these people running with many configurations, should I be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> running in Gridmode, not connected to OSGrid but should I need to run my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> opensim in grid mode using all those external files to run the user
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> server so it will find the users.  Or did I do something else wrong.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But if someone could just help me configure groups in a more detailed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> way for a standalone that would be nice too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Follow the link given in step 1) of the installation instructions and 
</I>&gt;<i> use the &quot;Download Source&quot; button in the upper right of that page to 
</I>&gt;<i> download a ZIP archive with everything you need (and some more).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Inside this ZIP archive, you'll find a subdirectory 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;XmlRpcGroupsServer&quot;. The contents of that directory are what you 
</I>&gt;<i> actually need to copy to your xampp/htdocs/groups directory. Your 
</I>&gt;<i> Apache web server must be able to run PHP scripts in this directory 
</I>&gt;<i> (since you are using XAMPP, I take it that this is  already the case).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Step 2) tells you to copy config.php.example to config.php and to edit 
</I>&gt;<i> it appropriately. Make sure that you provide the correct settings for 
</I>&gt;<i> the database (see next step). You can keep the default values for the 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Group security&quot; settings. (Once you have groups successfully running, 
</I>&gt;<i> you may want to change both $groupRequireAgentAuthForWrite and 
</I>&gt;<i> $groupEnforceGroupPerms to TRUE; they work fine in my setup.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Step 3) requires you to add some tables to the MySQL database. You can 
</I>&gt;<i> add these tables to the same database that you are using for your 
</I>&gt;<i> standalone, or use a separate one. I added the tables to my existing 
</I>&gt;<i> standalone database with this command:
</I>&gt;<i>    mysql -u root -p standalone &lt; groups.sql
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;standalone&quot; is the name of my database, and groups.sql is a file in 
</I>&gt;<i> the directory that you copied in step 1).  You will be asked for the 
</I>&gt;<i> database server's root password.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now, in step 4), you can enable the settings in the [Groups] section 
</I>&gt;<i> in OpenSim.ini. Make sure that the GroupsServerURI is correct and that 
</I>&gt;<i> the other settings correspond to those you made in step 2. For 
</I>&gt;<i> example, the ReadKey and WriteKey must match in both OpenSim.ini and 
</I>&gt;<i> config.php.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Don't forget to restart your standalone after making these adjustments.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please let us know if you still have problems with the setup.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I use windows 7 64bit using 32bitlaunch.  Running on 8 gig of ram and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1720 gig drive space.  Quad core.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I use MySql data base.  DSL 5.5 kbps and use DynDNS providing my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> personal web address.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> MY web page runs fine from my machine.  I used XAMPP to install apache,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mysql I downloaded and installed separately first.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am not a networking expert and might have gone wrong from the start.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I had to change the port in which opensim runs.  because windows 7 was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> using 9000 for its own use, I tell opensim to use port 9030 and could on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from there for regions.  Not sure if that was the way to go.  Could I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have done that another way?  I do use a router.  The D-Link 4500 with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Game fuel turned off.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Any help appreciated, thanks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>OK, I haven't tried it yet, I only just woke up.  But I didn't want to 
wait to thank you, that was the most comprehensive discription I have 
seen yet.  I will let you know how it all goes.  And it sounds like this 
should help.  The first time I tried to get each file off of flotsom's 
site individually.  I never noticed the zip file.  I am a legally blind, 
only one useful eye and one that gets fuzzy after to much use.  That 
alonge with a kidney transplant.  I don't know if that zip was there 
before or I might have missed it.  But this sounds like it will help 
me.  Thanks again. 

I really apprecaite your time.
