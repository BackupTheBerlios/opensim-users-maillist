<PRE>How about RDF for OAR metadata?

kind regards,

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is related to a thread from the dec '09 archives, &quot;Re: OAR File
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sharing Revisited&quot;, but I have some subject matter to add to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; previous discussion that I don't think was directly addressed.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The OAR &amp; IAR file formats need a meta-data component, most likely
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; XML-based. This would facilitate many file sharing capabilities, allow
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for some sort of version system AND, most importantly I think, allow for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tracking relationships between OAR's. The last capability seems to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; relate back to &quot;Re: OpenVCE OAR on Mega-Region?&quot; thread from jan '10.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There actually is already a metadata file contained within OARs and IARs
</I>&gt;<i> called archive.xml.  It doesn't act as a manifest but it does record
</I>&gt;<i> version numbers for upward compatibility purposes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Right now there's no mechanism for tracking relationships between
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; multiple OARs other than the archive's filename which tells almost
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; nothing about contents of the archive. Dido for IAR. A Meta-data system
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of OAR/IAR archives should first and fore-most list the contents of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; archive as well as additional meta-data for each of individual component
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of those contents. Version tracking is particularly useful  in the case
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; where a second user wishes to edit and re-archive the contents of an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; OAR, which would be a kind of sim re-mix. The would also allow for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; saving/loading multi-region sims in ways that address some of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; short-falls of the current megaregion scheme (terrain load-tile still
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; isn't working on my server, but I digress...)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not being able to save multi-regions is annoying and will ideally be fixed
</I>&gt;<i> one day.  Loading/saving regions is unfortunately probably more
</I>&gt;<i> complicated than simply load/saving the separate 256x256 spaces.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I also think that the issue of sharing content is seperate from the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; issue of running the OpenSim server, meaning it should not be handled by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; another os module. All that the OpenSim server requires for loading new
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; content from OARs and IARs is that the archive be placed in a folder
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; under the bin heiarchy (I download OARs to bin/import/oar)  and then
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; loaded via the server command line. This is a pretty simple mechanism,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; although some extra command line tools like the ability to list the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; contents of an archive before loading it (via meta-data component) would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be extremely helpful.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Archives are actually just tar.gz files.  You can untar them and inspect
</I>&gt;<i> their contents.  See
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/OpenSim_Archives">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/OpenSim_Archives</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> for more details.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However, the issue of retreiving OARs and IARS from a remote location is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; another matter. What's needed is a  separate application for tracking
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and sharing OAR/IAR and it would naturally implement the above mentioned
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; meta-data component. Given these needs it seem like an appropriate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; system might be something like a feed/subscription system, kind of like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a podcast/aggregator app. Feeds allow an app to track updates to content
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; without requiring the host system to actually download such content. The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; retreival process can be managed, customized and automated, much like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the process of retrieving new and past episodes in a podcast feed.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Although the podcast system is limited by centralization, I think an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; OAR/IAR feed system could implement some form of peer-to-peer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; distribution capability, as well as allowing for multiple
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; creator/authors for a single feed (and multiple versions of a single
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; OAR/sim).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not going to address this point directly, but I will note that it's
</I>&gt;<i> possible to load iars/oars on the command line from an URL as well as a
</I>&gt;<i> file.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Any more complicated arrangement should almost certainly be left for tools
</I>&gt;<i> outside OpenSim, imo.  There are hooks by which add-on region modules can
</I>&gt;<i> call load/save oar/iar functionality.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This would be awesome. My lexicon of technical terms kind of fails me
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; when I think about the possibilities for OpenSim. If there's any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; interest in these ideas I'd love to have an extensive group discussion
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on the details of a potential implementation.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; play and have fun,
