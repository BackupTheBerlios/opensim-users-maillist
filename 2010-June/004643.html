<PRE>Hello everyone,

I'm using OS 0.6.9 compiled from source and running on Win7 64-bit.  Currently, I am operating in HyperGrid-StandAlone (Serverless Grid) mode.  Although, over the last two years, I've run OS in each of its supported modes at various times, respectively.

When I start my current simulation, I launch a 4X4 matrix of 16 OpenSim.32BitLaunch.exe instances.  The OS Simulator instances are themselves each a 4X4 matrix of 16 Regions.  Thus, total adjacent (contiguous) regions are 256.  I typically use the SL viewer to visualize my simulation.  However, the problem I'm about to describe also existed on XP SP2 64-bit and does exist with the Hippo viewer.  Please note, I run a LAN connected between the &quot;server-side&quot; box and 2 separate &quot;client-side&quot; boxes.

Once my simulation is launched, I can generate my 16, 32-bit OS Sims and I can see within the SL map viewer all of the 256 Regions without any trouble.  Aside from the problem I'm about to describe, I can move my avatars and their inventory (custom JPG tattoo-skins and tiny body-sizes) through-out the entire simulation.  No data is ever lost through the MySQL backend and simulations with OS 0.6.9 are actually quite good otherwise.

I have 2 intermittent OS problems.  I will describe only one here.

Sometimes, the mini-map output and the simulated &quot;physical&quot; terrain output associated with the mini-map display does not exist after a Teleport to a distant region.  Effectively, after TP, my avatar will reappear suspended over water and then a few seconds later, it will just disappear.  I may, or may not, see adjacent Regions within the SL viewer.  My Regions are numbered 0-15 on a side; 0-3, 4-7, 8-11, 12-15, per OS Sim instance, respectively.  Ports, of course, are unique.

This is an intermittent failure and can (sometimes-by-work-around) be overcome by Teleporting or Flying/Walking into an adjacent-diagonal Region and then re-entering the missing area &quot;straight-on.&quot;  (Note: it appears that Regions only generate when I'm +2 Regions removed from the offending &quot;target&quot; Region.)  However, when this problem does occur, even this &quot;work-around&quot; will not cause the missing Regions to generate.  Furthermore, there is no consistency as to which regions will fail to rezz and demonstrate this problem.  Even my &quot;home&quot; region can demonstrate this trouble when I TP back to it.

Time to generate-rezz is not an issue.  I have literally waited overnight in tests to understand this problem.  Also, if the missing Regions &quot;ever do&quot; generate, they can be manipulated and WILL hold prims for later usage.

Has anyone seen anything like this?  If it has already been reported in a Mantis, I couldn't find it.  Thanks in advance for the opportunity to ask the user group.  I look forward to your collective help.

Respectfully,

Chris
