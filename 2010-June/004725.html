</I>
There actually is already a metadata file contained within OARs and IARs called archive.xml.  It doesn't act as a 
manifest but it does record version numbers for upward compatibility purposes.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right now there's no mechanism for tracking relationships between
</I>&gt;<i> multiple OARs other than the archive's filename which tells almost
</I>&gt;<i> nothing about contents of the archive. Dido for IAR. A Meta-data system
</I>&gt;<i> of OAR/IAR archives should first and fore-most list the contents of the
</I>&gt;<i> archive as well as additional meta-data for each of individual component
</I>&gt;<i> of those contents. Version tracking is particularly useful  in the case
</I>&gt;<i> where a second user wishes to edit and re-archive the contents of an
</I>&gt;<i> OAR, which would be a kind of sim re-mix. The would also allow for
</I>&gt;<i> saving/loading multi-region sims in ways that address some of the
</I>&gt;<i> short-falls of the current megaregion scheme (terrain load-tile still
</I>&gt;<i> isn't working on my server, but I digress...)
</I>
Not being able to save multi-regions is annoying and will ideally be fixed one day.  Loading/saving regions is 
unfortunately probably more complicated than simply load/saving the separate 256x256 spaces.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I also think that the issue of sharing content is seperate from the
</I>&gt;<i> issue of running the OpenSim server, meaning it should not be handled by
</I>&gt;<i> another os module. All that the OpenSim server requires for loading new
</I>&gt;<i> content from OARs and IARs is that the archive be placed in a folder
</I>&gt;<i> under the bin heiarchy (I download OARs to bin/import/oar)  and then
</I>&gt;<i> loaded via the server command line. This is a pretty simple mechanism,
</I>&gt;<i> although some extra command line tools like the ability to list the
</I>&gt;<i> contents of an archive before loading it (via meta-data component) would
</I>&gt;<i> be extremely helpful.
</I>
Archives are actually just tar.gz files.  You can untar them and inspect their contents.  See

<A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/OpenSim_Archives">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/OpenSim_Archives</A>

for more details.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, the issue of retreiving OARs and IARS from a remote location is
</I>&gt;<i> another matter. What's needed is a  separate application for tracking
</I>&gt;<i> and sharing OAR/IAR and it would naturally implement the above mentioned
</I>&gt;<i> meta-data component. Given these needs it seem like an appropriate
</I>&gt;<i> system might be something like a feed/subscription system, kind of like
</I>&gt;<i> a podcast/aggregator app. Feeds allow an app to track updates to content
</I>&gt;<i> without requiring the host system to actually download such content. The
</I>&gt;<i> retreival process can be managed, customized and automated, much like
</I>&gt;<i> the process of retrieving new and past episodes in a podcast feed.
</I>&gt;<i> Although the podcast system is limited by centralization, I think an
</I>&gt;<i> OAR/IAR feed system could implement some form of peer-to-peer
</I>&gt;<i> distribution capability, as well as allowing for multiple
</I>&gt;<i> creator/authors for a single feed (and multiple versions of a single
</I>&gt;<i> OAR/sim).
</I>
I'm not going to address this point directly, but I will note that it's possible to load iars/oars on the command line 
from an URL as well as a file.

Any more complicated arrangement should almost certainly be left for tools outside OpenSim, imo.  There are hooks by 
which add-on region modules can call load/save oar/iar functionality.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This would be awesome. My lexicon of technical terms kind of fails me
</I>&gt;<i> when I think about the possibilities for OpenSim. If there's any
</I>&gt;<i> interest in these ideas I'd love to have an extensive group discussion
</I>&gt;<i> on the details of a potential implementation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> play and have fun,
</I>&gt;<i> Revlin
