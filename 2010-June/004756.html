Exactly Mr. Blue that is the general framework in a nutshell. Regression
testing of versions, operating systems, and hardware configurations for
comparisons and such would be a wonderful thing indeed.

The idea of a common single region oar file is great too.

Dirk, the load testing would be targeted at individual servers (machines) to
help people determine what their systems can handle. This of course would
benefit those who are putting together grids too. It often feels like we are
all building race cars but have no idea what race we are going to be using
them at. How do we know what hardware will handle what purpose? It is a
pretty reasonable assumption that most people at least have some idea what
they are hoping to accomplish when they build their OpenSim systems. Maybe
they just want a single region for their 10 friends to watch movies or
someone might need to train 100 people for an afternoon on some new business
process. If I have a server that is performing at 75 btps (Bot Trots Per
Second) and we know that equates to 12 avatars comfortably using a single
region then I need to plan my hardware accordingly. Who knows, you might
just need to make a few tweaks to an INI file to get your Bot Trots up to
150. At least there would be a way to measure it. It may be necessary to
have 5 or 6 actual tests to determine various aspects of the server
capabilities or as simple as making 500 bots run from one side of the region
to the other in the shortest time (we could call it the Red Rover effect).

Just from my own observations of people in SL and other grids there are only
a few things we all do consistently (other than buying shoes), stand around
and chat, walk, dance, and fly. Creating some bots that do those things
would be a great starting point. I remember RealXtend came with Beneath the
Waves and it had several bots swimming all around (really killed my poor
little laptop server). :)
