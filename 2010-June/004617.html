<PRE>Actually...

I believe a more accurate summation of this thread would be...

Un-knowing Grid operator recieves a PROPER request from Lilith to remove
un-authorized copies of her creations...

Grid Operator begins rant about how it isn't  HIS responsibility that
someone on his grid decided to upload pirated content..  These include
digressions into how  HIS stuff is FREE... It MUST be the Lindens fault for
letting it leak...culminating in the inevitable  &quot;DRM is STUPID&quot; conclusion

Grid Operator shares semi-coherent &quot;play by play&quot; on his efforts to make
things right...   Readers ignore it and go Huh?

Anti-DRM/DMCA participants  point to this as ANOTHER reason why efforts to
&quot;protect content creators&quot; are inherently evil and disruptive to our
existence....

The sad fact of the matter is this...   If you open your grid to the
public,  you GIVE YOURSELF the responsibility to respond to appropriate DMCA
take down requests.  Because OpenSimulator is an alpha product, there are
not any real established &quot;best practices&quot; or step-by-step procedures
available to grid operators to accomplish the requested/required asset
identification and removal.  This doesn't mean you are not REQUIRED BY LAW
to comply with a proper request.  Sadly,  this means that some unknowing
grid operators who decide that having a grid full of &quot;cool stuff&quot; is more
important than having a &quot;clean grid&quot; are going to find their business model
&quot;disturbed&quot; when their &quot;cool stuff&quot;  is identified as pirated content.

It's pretty clear that there is a community of people using OpenSimulator
that detest the concepts of DRM and view the DMCA as &quot;wrong&quot;, so they make a
personal choice to ignore its existence.  Instead of posting rants here,
maybe your efforts to reform DRM and the DMCA would be better served by
posting it to lists where the legal community can read it.  This is a
software development support mailing list.  Some of us believe that in order
for OpenSimulator to grow into a platform for commercial applications, it
will REQUIRE that content creators see efforts devoted to protecting their
IP.

Just like Master Mirage, our efforts to move the software forward are
hindered.  They are hindered by perceptions that the entire OpenSimulator
community feels the same about protecting content.   Instead of endlessly
posting political positions and stories about your personal decisions to be
&quot;better&quot; than those who prefer to distribute licensed content, please keep
the mailing list discussions directed at issues related to helping others
install, configure, and operate OpenSimulator.

</I>&gt;<i> Subject: Re: [Opensim-users] Speaking of Content Theft, How About Our Own
</I>&gt;<i> Backyard?
</I>&gt;<i> This is the last post from Lillith Heart that made it to the opensim-user
</I>&gt;<i> list so I will respond to this one.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What Lillith seems to be advocating is converting Second Life and
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSimulator grids into some sort of &quot;There.com&quot; clone where all sales are
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;vetted&quot; by the grid management.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As the fate of There.com shows, this is every bit as unworkable as the
</I>&gt;<i> DMCA!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In simple terms these mass inspections cost a LOT of time, money and
</I>&gt;<i> effort!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Time, money, and effort that could be spent improving the grid itself for
</I>&gt;<i> the users.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would remind everyone that the purpose of IP laws is NOT to ensure that
</I>&gt;<i> large &quot;content Creators&quot; get rich, but to encourage and reward innovation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://news.slashdot.org/story/10/05/25/2222207/The-Fashion-Industry-As-a-Model-For-IP-Reform">http://news.slashdot.org/story/10/05/25/2222207/The-Fashion-Industry-As-a-Model-For-IP-Reform</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No one can argue that the RL fashion industry is not creative and hugely
</I>&gt;<i> profitable if you get the formula right!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In short unless the &quot;injured party&quot; themselves provide the identification
</I>&gt;<i> of stolen content AS THE LAW REQUIRES, there is no reason for authorities to
</I>&gt;<i> assume this burden.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There have been any number of attempts to shift this burden, but I am not
</I>&gt;<i> aware of any that has actually increased innovation or creativity in any
</I>&gt;<i> way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As we see in Second Life right now though, these witch hunts are a great
</I>&gt;<i> way to &quot;settle scores&quot; and &quot;cripple the competition&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
