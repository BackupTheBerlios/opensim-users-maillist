<PRE>OpenSim is an opensource software. Which means it's unstoppable. It
will grow, it will be cloned/forked, more and more grids will pop up,
etc...

As such, there is no enforcing of content theft spotted in a grid
other than the usual procedures applying to the web in general. I, as
a webcomic artist (oghme.com) have experienced it too. Same for
musicians, same for software developers, same for everybody publishing
anything in a format that can be numerically duplicated.

You can't expect &quot;free grids&quot; administrators (you don't pay for osgrid
servers if you don't want to donate) to do more than an
isp/hosting-company would do. And that is : act when there solicited
by a legal authority through the already existing chanels. And i'm not
even talking about the myriad of standalone grids, for which your only
resort already IS to try and work it out with the myriad of ISPs.
(good luck)

Total Content Protection on the web is a dream (or nightmare according
to where you stand from). If Second Life had its time, its closed and
profitable business model is dying (fast). All the more so as the
scarcity of extra-SL content is bound to  become a memory as more and
more grids go open and interconnect to one another.

When the injured party is an individual, on the web, its weight equals
something close to zero.

Sad &amp; true.

(personal POV)
