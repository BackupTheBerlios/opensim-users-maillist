<PRE>Aloha!

As someone who also uses bots to do a lot of my testing, I thought I'd share
my $.02....

I'm not going to comment a lot about the overall usefulness of small scale
Load Tests.....  MrBlue had it right a couple posts ago when he said...

Testing the load of a large number of clients requires a lot of
infrastructure -- multiple client systems and a lot of networking. That
makes stress testing difficult to set up and to create a portable, automated
stress tester.

Proper tests don't just pick one aspect of performance ( how many agents
does my console report in the region), but are designed to see how many
pieces in the complex system interact under stress. Another difficult aspect
of generalized tests is identifying which level of performance is
acceptable.   Load testing Currency Transfer routines is vastly different
from making sure all 4500 of your particles are properly rendered at 48
meters....  In this same way,  bots are NOT graphical viewers,  but they are
usefull tools for interacting with virtual spaces...so efforts to make them
better help us all.

That being said,  I use both *TestClient*  (
<A HREF="http://lib.openmetaverse.org/wiki/TestClient">http://lib.openmetaverse.org/wiki/TestClient</A> ) and  *Radegast* (
<A HREF="http://radegastclient.org/wp/">http://radegastclient.org/wp/</A> ) based bots for my testing.   Radegast is my
favorite for a light weight client that lets me access a bot when I want to
interact with others or inventory.  All of the scripted testing I do is via
a TestClient based bot.  There are a number of reasons for this... First.
it is simple to approximate loads close to &quot;real&quot; avatars.   Like MrBlue
says...

I have found that TestClient bots that do something (walk around, chat), in
aggregate, give a load pretty close to a &quot;normal&quot; viewer load.  I have been
using scripts that start up groups of bots that walk around (waypoint to
waypoint) but I don't have good scenarios of what large numbers of avatars
realistically do in a region.

Second..  The scripting option makes it easier to devise simple tests.
When I have a script that uploads 100 textures, it can be repeated, timed,
and its success documented as the number of failed uploads.  It can also be
combined with scripts designed to stress other capabilities we expect as
users.


Here are some of the &quot;tests&quot;  I have designed and used.

Logins -  automated login and logout of clients.  I have found that the
TestClient command /console gets cumbersome with more than 10 bots per
client.   I have scripts to log in groups of 10 and groups of 5.  Testing
involves logging in n groups of 5 or 10 to reach a specified avatar count.
Once they log in they TP to a particular place in the region and rebake
thier appearance. Performance is measured in % of successful logins
completed, Time for all the logins to complete, and the % of appearance
rebakes that complete.  If you just do THIS test to a remote server, you
will understand quickly that the only thing really stressed is your modem
and the network traffic police at your ISP,  Unless they charge you by the
Byte...

Random Chat - Login 4 groups of 10 bots.   Position the groups in 4 corners
of the region.  Seat each of the bots on a poseball designed to switch
between poses every 25 seconds starting from when the bot sits down.  Every
time the pose changes, have the pose ball chat the name of the new pose.
This simulates groups of avatars changing animations and the load associated
with delivering and filtering chat messages.  Since it is difficult to
assign particular Success/Failure rates to this, I use it as &quot;background
noise&quot;...  How many bots can I have in region doing this while I can still
do &quot;my stuff&quot;

Texture uploads - Create a scripted object in world to act as a timer.   Add
loop in the timer event to send an IM to each bot, requesting it do a
texture upload.  Clone 1 for each of the bot groups.  Login 4 groups of 10
bots, sit them on the Random Chat poseballs  and have them accept IM
commands from the scripted prim.   Set the timer for 15 seconds,  this
should result in each bot getting an IM to upload a texture ( remember each
IM takes a second ).  Run this test over time...  It is simulating Asset
Database Additions,  Inventory updates,  In region IMs, inter-agent chats.
If you code your upload scripts right,  this can also be one way to get your
huge collection of textures loaded to a new grid :)

Walking paths -  login groups of various sizes to corners of the region,
script them to walk in sync with their group from corner to corner in loops
while either adding more walking avatars or loads of other types.  I usually
start with groups of 10 in each corner.  They are lined up on spots 1 meter
apart, their HOME location set, and then the whole group is commanded in
sequence to walk the same path.  after I get 40 avatars walking around the
outer edge of the region, I add groups of 5 to a path closer to the center
of the region and send the next 20 avatars walking around the loop.  There
is something &quot;just right&quot; about seeing the lines of bots flowing around the
edge of the region, and its easy to see when things &quot;break down&quot;...
commands get delayed, and bots get off-track.  You start to lag and watch
them walk off the edge of the region into never never land.   The lag gets
so severe that it takes bots 5-10 times the amount of time it should to walk
from corner to corner...    Just makes you want to be a Linden &gt;wink&lt;


As a final word...   There is important work to be in the &quot;Capabilities&quot;
testing space that might be more productive at this point in the OpenSim
development cycle.   IMHO, individuals are a bigger help to the development
community if they spend more time building things they want in empty
regions, and pushing the platform capabilities, rather than testing the
capacity of an architecture that is undergoing revolutionary change..
