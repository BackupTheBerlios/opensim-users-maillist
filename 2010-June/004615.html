Wow, that's quite a leap from her actual comments.  I don't think she
advocated anything (which was a shame) other than that grid owners be
sensitive to content creators.  Personally I'd like to see more of a
dialog from content creators on what sort of solutions they'd find
acceptable.  At a minimum I believe (and past history would seem to
support it) that grids providing publicly accessible services need to
provide a mechanism for reporting illegal use of copyrighted content and
when reports are filed investigate and handle them. And yes this costs
money. It's a cost of doing business.

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;<i> In short unless the &quot;injured party&quot; themselves provide the

The legal responsibility runs both ways.  Yes, the injured party needs
to provide proof of infringement.  And the service provider needs to
handle reports diligently when they happen.  Past attempts to claim a
service is just a pass through and that there's no responsibility for
content therein have failed. The law recognizes service providers as a
part of the transaction so grid operators need to consider how they wish
to handle that responsibility if they're providing a publically
accessible service.
