<PRE>I'm so glad someone did this.  When I started about a month ago,  it took me
a couple of days to get things going since I was doing stuff that didn't
need to be done.  So much incorrect information wasted a lot of time.

Thanks!

Subject: [Opensim-users] Overhauled some of the basic OpenSim instructionson
the wiki

Hi folks,

Because I'm the exception that proves the rule, I spent quite a lot of time
today overhauling the basic OpenSim wiki configuration instructions at

<A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Configuration">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Configuration</A>

I deleted a lot of the old out-of-date misleading information and tried to
simplify the text.  I also removed some information that is better explained
in the various .ini.example files.  At this stage, experience suggests that
duplicating this information on the wiki just leads to it becoming stale and
misleading.

I've also added addition text for standalone setup instructions in 0.7-rc1
and onwards (these are also in the README.txt file in the OpenSim
distribution - in this case I think the duplication is better than not).

I haven't yet added 0.7-rc1 grid setup instructions though I have added an
extra notice on how they've probably changed. 
  In fact, these will be simpler in the future since a basic setup now only
requires you to start up a single Robust.exe (thanks Melanie :)

If people want to take a look over it that would be great (or even update it
if necessary).  I think that we should keep this page as simple as
reasonably possible and shunt more advanced information over to other pages
(preferably with an entry in the main user page at

<A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/User_Documentation">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/User_Documentation</A>

as well.
