<PRE>The non root prims are now persisting after a restart as of latest git =)

But I can not unlink the attachment objects after rezzing them in world. 
If I try to unlink them it will immediately highlight only the root prim 
and report a prim count of 1. After unlink attempt I end up with a 
similar situation when the bug was first reported where I can not edit 
the unlinked prims and the server believes that I am wearing the object 
again: Take is gone from the menu, Detatch is there and grayed out, and 
the Viewer will crash immediately if I attempt to edit. All the prims do 
survive a server restart though. I can however edit, delete, and 
otherwise manipulate the prim that used to be root before unlink attempt.

This time around a server restart will not remedy it and the client will 
always crash if I try to edit any part of the unlinked object other than 
what used to be root. I have to revert to an older git before the bug 
first appeared in order to get rid of these prims.

As long as I don't try to unlink the objects I can edit, delete, move 
the object etc and all the prims seem to persist after a restart.

Testing with Phoenix 373, 1102, SL Viewer 2.7, and SLv3.0 and using 
latest git as of r/16652

Thank you!
