</I>&gt;<i> but the script states didn't clear them selves out (if i remember correctly) until just recently.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The relogging I don't mind so much =) but is there anyway to keep the script states from deleting themselves in this
</I>&gt;<i> situation?
</I>
There may well be a fix but I don't think that it can be done for the coming release, Chris.  Please could you open a 
mantis and put the details in there.  Thanks!
