<PRE>Sounds intressting, but if there's a switch. it sounds more intressting
to save creators and uuid's always. and with loading check if uuid
exists. if not use creator name.

</I>&gt;<i> user names (or to the estate manager if they are not present).

</I>&gt;<i> Also, in this we're doing things that the client was never explicitly designed to do, though it has been working.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The problem is that when imported via an OAR, the owner/creator of an asset are set correctly IF that UUID can be found
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in the database (we are running all of them under MySQL). If it can't be found, it defaults to the simulator owner (me).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That means that I wind up owning all the assets I have to move between simulators.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Has anyone got any suggestions as to how I could change the UUIDs to be the same on each of the simulators (in other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; words, what tables in the opensim database need to be modified and what fields)? Has anyone tried to do this before?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I suspect I am going to run into the same problem with user UUID's when I move all of the stand-alones into a grid
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; configuration.
