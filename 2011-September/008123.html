<PRE>I agree with you!

I use the name &quot;Karen Palen&quot; on at least a dozen grids, each with
content that I have created on my private standalone. Often there are
local &quot;tweaks&quot; suited to the local grid.

Typically (but not always any more) the items were uploaded via Second
Inventory or a Viewer based XML file so the &quot;owner&quot; is the local
&quot;Karen&quot;. In several instances recently though I have used hypergrid for
my standalone &quot;Karen&quot; to visit a &quot;Karen&quot; on another grid to transfer items.

Name collisions of this kind would be very hard to resolve even without
any &quot;evil intent&quot;!
