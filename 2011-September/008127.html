<PRE>IThe question I've seen asked on on this list before, but searching
through archives I'm not finding it. It regards SoaS, and how to use
it on a computer that isn't online. It seems to need an active network
connection to be able to log in. So what do I need to change to be
able to use SoaS when not connected to the network? It was a really
simple fix, if I recall.

Something related to share that the tin-foil-hatters among us may find
curious (if it's not already common knowledge and I'm just living
under a rock). I recently installed PeerBlock (formerly PeerGuardian)
to supplement my firewall. When connecting to OpenSim grids (including
SoaS), it seems Imprudence sends an outbound HTTP connection to Linden
Lab and won't allow login to any grid as long as that connection is
blocked. I haven't tried this with any other TPVs. It's difficult to
imagine any reason for LL to be notified anytime someone logs onto an
OS grid with a TPV. Probably just totally benign left-over code from
the original SL viewer that nobody's gotten around to removing, would
be my guess. Anyway, that's actually what sparked the fruitless
archive dig and the subsequent question above!

Cheers,
~!CJ
