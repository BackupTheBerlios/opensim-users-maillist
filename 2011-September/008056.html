<PRE>I am not Gary, but you will love that new router.  I have one and have 
run it on my opensim grid for a few years of this now.  One thing to 
remember.  Maybe you know something I don't, but running it on my 
network seems it causes issues with people not being able to log on when 
I turn on the gamefuel options.  I turned them off and all is well.

Also this router makes it easy to give each computer on the network a 
permanant LAN address.  I didn't even have to dig around the windows 
config.  Have fun and good luck.

</I>&gt;<i> Both the diva d2 grid from the vista computer and the opensim grid

</I>&gt;<i> Let me say what I did:
</I>&gt;<i> 1-I bypassed the router, making the computer connected straight to the

</I>&gt;<i> 2-I turned the windows firewall off
</I>&gt;<i> 3-I turned the avg antivirus off (looks like the people don't

</I>&gt;<i> 4-I changed the ini files to use my external IP address as you

</I>&gt;<i> 5-Asked the remote friends to use <A HREF="http://myExternalIPaddress:9000">http://myExternalIPaddress:9000</A> to login
</I>&gt;<i> Then, this work. They was able to connect to the grid from Diva D2 and 
</I>&gt;<i> also to the new grid straight from opensimulator.org intructions.
</I>&gt;<i> The conclusion is I have no grid setup problem.  The most probable 
</I>&gt;<i> issue is the router. I was using Belkin Surf router.
</I>&gt;<i> I bought a new router suggested from the simulator.org list with the 
</I>&gt;<i> most large loopback, the D-Link DGL-4500. Soon I will back here to update.
</I>&gt;<i> (Just in case, I bought it by $87 days ago.)
</I>&gt;<i> The remaining issues are about the Windows firewall and the 
</I>&gt;<i> Antivirus.  About windows firewall, I believe the ports are open well, 
</I>&gt;<i> unless there are
</I>&gt;<i> same ports being used by another applications (I don't have skill 
</I>&gt;<i> enough for this), that make some kind of conflict (only supposition). 
</I>&gt;<i> About the antivirus I will ask them
</I>&gt;<i> in case of the handshaking problem remain after install the new router.
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you again and I will be back with the conclusion about the new 
</I>&gt;<i> router installation.
