<PRE>Let me try Chris. Othere can correct me if I am wrong on any point.

The first thing to understudying is that the HG arrangements have 
been altereing across 0.6.9, 0.7.10, 0.7.1 and its minor variants, so 
soem are NOT at all compatible and you cannot jump from one to 
another.  There have also been changes to the string used to 
dfescribe a HG location in osAentTeleport, and the map type in box... 
but old versions are still supported in the current dev releases. I 
will restrict myself here to answers from a 0.7.2 Dev perspective as 
we are now at 0.7.2 RC2 and it sjhoud soon be the ofiocial stable release.

</I>
For same reason you have not changed others have not I expect.... it 
is work for one grid run by one group, imaging something like, OSGrid 
with thousands of region owners and computers.    Some of us have 
been suggesting that a waning &quot;are you sure you want to go above 
4096,4096&quot; warning be given in the console when a region is created 
to gently encourage people not to make more new regions above that.

&gt;<i>QUESTION 2:  If people aren't going to change to lower centers, then don't
</I>&gt;<i>we all need to publish the region centers in addition to the HG address in
</I>&gt;<i>order for travelers to know whether they can make the jump or not?
</I>

YES YES YES.. It is the first question I ask anyone who gives me a HG 
address before I try a jump, otherwise how would I know where to jump 
from?  On our HG gateway regions for hopping up and down grids we 
show a map board of how to jump... along with aactive HG 
osAgentTeleport items on them that an avatar can click on and go in 
one click. see images at <A HREF="http://openvce.net/2011-01-27-opensim-hypergrid">http://openvce.net/2011-01-27-opensim-hypergrid</A>

We publish our regions like this:

Visit Openvue via Hypergrid:
    <A HREF="http://virtual.aiai.ed.ac.uk:8002">http://virtual.aiai.ed.ac.uk:8002</A> Openvue  (at 1000,1000)
    <A HREF="http://virtual.aiai.ed.ac.uk:8002">http://virtual.aiai.ed.ac.uk:8002</A> Vue-5000 (at 5000,5000)
    <A HREF="http://virtual.aiai.ed.ac.uk:8002">http://virtual.aiai.ed.ac.uk:8002</A> Vue-9000 (at 9017,9017)

Vue-hosted Hypergrid Gateways and Regions on OSGrid:
    <A HREF="http://hg.osgrid.org:80">http://hg.osgrid.org:80</A> Vue-3200  (at 3200,3200)

    <A HREF="http://hg.osgrid.org:80">http://hg.osgrid.org:80</A> VCE       (at 6400,6399)

We provide an active object on each HG gateway and our core regions 
which displays the grid name and

&gt;<i>QUESTION 3:  I'm completely confused about the correct formatting for a
</I>&gt;<i>hypergrid URL.  I've seen so many variations!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i><A HREF="secondlife://domain.com:8002:RegionName">secondlife://domain.com:8002:RegionName</A>
</I>&gt;<i><A HREF="http://domain.com:8002:RegionName">http://domain.com:8002:RegionName</A>
</I>&gt;<i><A HREF="http://hg.domain.com:8002:RegionName">http://hg.domain.com:8002:RegionName</A>
</I>
First does not work for OpenSim in chat in Viewer 2 any longer I believe.

yourdomain.com:port:region continues to work as the old supported format.

<A HREF="http://yourdomain.com:port:region">http://yourdomain.com:port:region</A> works I think, but was an 
intermediate form on the way to the current version with the region 
name separated off, and a compulsory <A HREF="http://">http://</A> on the front to give a 
proper URL.  (hg.domain.com is just someone using hg in their DNS, 
you will see it on hg.osgrid.org:80 - but it could be 
myrobustserver.domain.com)

<A HREF="http://domain.com:port">http://domain.com:port</A> Regionname  is the currently preferred format. 
Use &quot; &quot; round teh region name if it includes a space.

&gt;<i>QUESTION 4:  FleepGrid is running OpenSim 0.7.1 Release (interface version
</I>&gt;<i>7) and FleepGrid Plaza is centered at 9000,9000 currently, but I also have a
</I>&gt;<i>Hypergate region at 5000,5000 and 13000,13000.  If you're running a
</I>&gt;<i>compatible version of opensim and theoretically I SHOULD be able to
</I>&gt;<i>hypergrid to your destination, can you reply with the address so I can give
</I>&gt;<i>it a try on a known &quot;should work&quot; region?  I'm finding so many broken
</I>&gt;<i>addresses and links and things I'm going crazy trying to figure out what's
</I>&gt;<i>wrong with hypergridding out.
</I>
You are asking too limited a question as you are on 0.7.1  and if 
other grids are on 0.7.1.1 not 0.7.2 you will not be able to jump 
successfully Try a jump to Vue-9000 though as a test. It is running 
0.7.2 dev master (effectively the sake as 0.7 RC2).  Upgrade to 
0.7.1.1 or 0.7.2 RC2 and you should be able to try a jump to Vue-9000 
which is at (actually just very near for technical reasons) 
9000,9000. And if your firewall and servers are set up jump back home.
