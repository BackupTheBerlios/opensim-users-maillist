The name lookup used to happen and still will with old OARs that use a different resolution method (OSPA).  I think this 
was last used back in 0.6.9.  For recent opensim, only a UUID lookup is done - if a simple string creator name is used 
then there's no attempt to reassociate it with a user account.

I think overly trusting user names on grids is a mistake - after all, anybody person could create an account with that 
name and associate bad content with it.  And to be honest, the SL mechanisms were never designed with this kind of 
content transfer to third party grids in mind.
