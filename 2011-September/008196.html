<PRE>Fleep,

Here's my personal understandings and opinions on your first question:

The only straightforward solution (afaik) would be to create a new 
viewer framework from the ground up with code written in bias of 
OpenSim's unique properties.  Considering how much time and effort is 
required to develop and maintain the current viewers and that it's 
almost completely done on a non-paying volunteer basis, it's safe to say 
that it will be some time until the problem is completely resolved.  If 
there's anyone here who's a crack coder working on a secret viewer, 
please speak up and set my timeline straight.

Now, as for grid locations - I completely respect the concept of moving 
grids below 4096, but I also happen to share an opinion (and not a 
popular one) that 10000, 10000 should be the default location around 
which all grids /interested in being part of the hypergrid community/ 
should congregate.  This is because OSGrid is centered there and has 
been - long before HG was introduced.  For myself and many others it is 
(and always will be) the center of the known metaverse.  Since it's also 
the development grid for OpenSim itself why not make it home base?  I 
understand some people aren't necessarily fond of OSGrid for it's 
non-uniform nature, some have never visited or have only limited 
knowledge of its inner workings and others are looking for grids with a 
currency system geared for fame and fortune.  However, there a few 
aspects of OSGrid which make it the ideal Hypergrid nexus:

1. It's completely free and open, even in it's content and services.  
Anyone can land there, pick up a folder load of freebies, meet people 
who can answer technical questions and hyperjump to many interesting 
locations.

2. It offers OpenSim newcomers a chance to connect to a functioning grid 
and learn the basic ins and outs of roll your own regions before 
striking out on their own and setting up standalone grids.

3. Barring a major malfunction of the main servers, there will always be 
some part of OSGrid up and running.  This is not always the case with 
independent grids as we've all experienced.

4. Given the first three points and probably several other benefits that 
go unmentioned, it would be far easier for people to relocate their 
grids (of considerably less size and complexity) closer to OSGrid than 
the other way around.

This is /my/ reason for placing my grid around 8000, 8000 and I know 
there are others who do likewise.  If grid owners/managers prefer to 
remain below 4096 they can and should place intermediate jump parcels 
accordingly.  What's one extra jump in the entire process?  I've taken 
the subway to and from work and other locations for years with line 
changes as part of my daily commute.  My only other option would be to 
move closer to work - I choose not to. I guess I view that and hypergrid 
travel in the same light - an invaluable convenience, imperfect in it's 
design, but unmatched by any alternatives within the given framework.

Just my 0.02 USD ;)

&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm having some trouble hypergridding FROM FleepGrid, though it

</I>&gt;<i> testing, I've not yet been able to successfully hypergrid out of 
</I>&gt;<i> FleepGrid to any destination, and I'm having a lot of confusion about

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the course of trying to chase down the problem, I've got several 
</I>&gt;<i> questions that I'm hoping someone on the list can either answer or 
</I>&gt;<i> point me to better resources for finding the answers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> QUESTION 1:  I understand Diva is encouraging everyone to relocate 
</I>&gt;<i> their sims to centers less than 4096,4096 and I understand why based 
</I>&gt;<i> on this blog post - The 4096 &quot;Bug&quot;: 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metaverseink.com/blog/?p=222">http://metaverseink.com/blog/?p=222</A>  It appears many people are NOT 
</I>&gt;<i> changing their coords to the lower centers, is there a reason why?  If 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm reading Diva's post correctly, the limitation is not going to go 
</I>&gt;<i> away any time soon so I'm wondering why folks aren't changing them to 
</I>&gt;<i> make hypergridding easier for travelers..  I haven't changed them on 
</I>&gt;<i> FleepGrid yet either (9000,9000) and trying to decide what's the best 
</I>&gt;<i> course to take both for FleepGrid and for the University of Cincinnati 
</I>&gt;<i> grid we're about to install.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> QUESTION 2:  If people aren't going to change to lower centers, then 
</I>&gt;<i> don't we all need to publish the region centers in addition to the HG 
</I>&gt;<i> address in order for travelers to know whether they can make the jump 
</I>&gt;<i> or not?  I'm finding 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.hyperica.com/complete-grid-list/">http://www.hyperica.com/complete-grid-list/</A> completely unhelpful as a 
</I>&gt;<i> directory because I don't know the region centers or  opensim/hg 
</I>&gt;<i> versions for most of the destinations.  So when my jump fails, I don't 
</I>&gt;<i> know if it's a problem on my end or because the region was too far 
</I>&gt;<i> away or because it's on a different version than me.   The Hypergrid 
</I>&gt;<i> Mall is another example, <A HREF="http://hypergridmall.com/">http://hypergridmall.com/</A> - Right on the 
</I>&gt;<i> front page it has the hypergrid address, but no center coords or 
</I>&gt;<i> version info, so when my jump fails, I don't know why.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> QUESTION 3:  I'm completely confused about the correct formatting for 
</I>&gt;<i> a hypergrid URL.  I've seen so many variations!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="secondlife://domain.com:8002:RegionName">secondlife://domain.com:8002:RegionName</A>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://domain.com:8002:RegionName">http://domain.com:8002:RegionName</A>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://hg.domain.com:8002:RegionName">http://hg.domain.com:8002:RegionName</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also not sure about proper formatting for region names with spaces in 
</I>&gt;<i> them, is a &quot;%20&quot; required or not?  Which of the following is correct?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://domain.com:8002:Region%20Name">http://domain.com:8002:Region%20Name</A>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://domain.com:8002:Region">http://domain.com:8002:Region</A> Name
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://domain.com:8002:">http://domain.com:8002:</A> Region Name
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> QUESTION 4:  FleepGrid is running OpenSim 0.7.1 Release (interface 
</I>&gt;<i> version 7) and FleepGrid Plaza is centered at 9000,9000 currently, but 
</I>&gt;<i> I also have a Hypergate region at 5000,5000 and 13000,13000.  If 
</I>&gt;<i> you're running a compatible version of opensim and theoretically I 
</I>&gt;<i> SHOULD be able to hypergrid to your destination, can you reply with 
</I>&gt;<i> the address so I can give it a try on a known &quot;should work&quot; region? 
</I>&gt;<i>  I'm finding so many broken addresses and links and things I'm going 
</I>&gt;<i> crazy trying to figure out what's wrong with hypergridding out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ................
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've reviewed the wiki pages 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Hypergrid">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Hypergrid</A> and 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Installing_and_Running_Hypergrid">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Installing_and_Running_Hypergrid</A> but I'm 
</I>&gt;<i> obviously still confused about some things.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks in advance for your thoughts or suggestions, and sorry if I'm 
</I>&gt;<i> behind the curve..
</I>&gt;<i>
