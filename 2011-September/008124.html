<PRE>Re: name collisions (I like that terminology)
Additionally, a skilled professional builder in-world would have his
reputation tarnished if someone were to upload poor-quality goods with
the same creator name. Again, this wouldn't require any 'evil intent',
the uploader may just be completely unaware of the other builder.

I don't mean to spread FUD (really!), but I do think it's something to
keep in mind. I'm very happy to see the introduction of the --profile
switch. It's a major step in the right direction and much better than
nothing, but it's not yet a complete solution. And really, name
collisions, at least those with any notable consequences, would be
extremely rare I expect.

I hold hope that since the 6-month wall has been removed between
viewer &amp; server development, we can expect to see workable solutions
eventually. I'm looking forward to things like &quot;Next owner can/cannot
transfer this off-grid&quot; checkbox permissions! Ideally including a CC
permission drop-down box on objects/textures, to select the
appropriate CC license (perhaps providing the appropriate link?), as
well as including Public Domain &amp; traditional copyright on that list.
Something similar for scripts with GPL, BSD, whathaveyou... /me keeps
dreaming...

@Justin
I agree that &quot;overly trusting user names on grids is a mistake&quot;,
though some people's professional reputations depend in large part on
their avatar names (whether using their RL name or not). Jokay
Wollongong and Pathfinder Lester are a couple that come to mind
immediately. Virtual worlds really are a &quot;second life&quot; in more ways
than one, and as time &amp; technology progress, will become more tightly
intertwined &amp; harder to separate from our first. Though I'm sure I
don't need to tell you, of all people! :)

Cheers,
~!CJ
