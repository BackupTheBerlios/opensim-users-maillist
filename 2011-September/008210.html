In principle, I thought it would have been possible to do both of these things through libomv, though you would need to 
ask on the libomv lists if anybody is available to help you.  As always, shuffling through the code is probably the best 
bet.

Via OpenSim, the way of doing this depends on exactly what you want to do.  If you want to import prims/meshes that 
already have scripts then you could use the load oar facility in the RemoteAdmin interface, possibly with the --merge 
option.  If you want to import a prim (perhaps via OAR) and then programatically associate a script this is not totally 
impossible but would involve a lot of delving into OpenSim internals, since there aren't good abstract interfaces for 
such tasks yet, and I don't know of any existing example code for doing this kind of thing.

As for &quot;clear assets&quot;, this is an ancient command with no implementation, so I ripped it out in git master 8caf3ed.  If 
you're using the default Flotsam asset cache then you can clear this via the existing &quot;fcache clear&quot; command.  However, 
this isn't something you want to do in normal practice.
