<PRE>The solutions already advanced sound good, though I've never tried these approaches myself.

Another possibility is to use the --profile switch in the save oar command.  Theoretically, this saves creator names 
into the OAR.  When loaded by another OpenSim, these are used for creator names instead of resolving the UUIDs back into 
user names (or to the estate manager if they are not present).

However, I've forgotten exactly how this switch works (I didn't write it :) and there's no documentation yet.  This 
needs to be investigated and written unless someone else can chime in.  I think the Kitely guys have it working if 
they're on the list and can contributed any data.

Also, in this we're doing things that the client was never explicitly designed to do, though it has been working.
