<PRE>Hi all,

I'm using OS 072 Dev r/16744 and I am noticing that if region cross / TP 
is not fully successful then any scripted attachments the avatar is 
wearing loses their state and start as if they have been reset.

By unsuccessful region cross I mean for example: on region cross the 
avatar walks / flies infinitely past the sim border as if network 
connection was lost on crossing. Or if direct TP the TP never fully 
finishes. Since this is the case the only fix is to log out and log back 
in because the avatar never successfully transfers to the target region.

I don't  believe this is related to the TP issues we've been seeing due 
to inconsistent attachment state as this can occur on any viewer whether 
attachment stack capable or not. I've also been seeing this particular 
TP issue since v0.6.9 but the script states didn't clear them selves out 
(if i remember correctly) until just recently.

The relogging I don't mind so much =) but is there anyway to keep the 
script states from deleting themselves in this situation?

Thanks!
