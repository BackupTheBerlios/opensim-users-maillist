<PRE>Well done Mimetic :)

</I>&gt;<i> Fleep,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here's my personal understandings and opinions on your first question:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The only straightforward solution (afaik) would be to create a new viewer
</I>&gt;<i> framework from the ground up with code written in bias of OpenSim's unique
</I>&gt;<i> properties.  Considering how much time and effort is required to develop and
</I>&gt;<i> maintain the current viewers and that it's almost completely done on a
</I>&gt;<i> non-paying volunteer basis, it's safe to say that it will be some time until
</I>&gt;<i> the problem is completely resolved.  If there's anyone here who's a crack
</I>&gt;<i> coder working on a secret viewer, please speak up and set my timeline
</I>&gt;<i> straight.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now, as for grid locations - I completely respect the concept of moving
</I>&gt;<i> grids below 4096, but I also happen to share an opinion (and not a popular
</I>&gt;<i> one) that 10000, 10000 should be the default location around which all grids
</I>&gt;<i> *interested in being part of the hypergrid community* should congregate.
</I>&gt;<i> This is because OSGrid is centered there and has been - long before HG was
</I>&gt;<i> introduced.  For myself and many others it is (and always will be) the
</I>&gt;<i> center of the known metaverse.  Since it's also the development grid for
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim itself why not make it home base?  I understand some people aren't
</I>&gt;<i> necessarily fond of OSGrid for it's non-uniform nature, some have never
</I>&gt;<i> visited or have only limited knowledge of its inner workings and others are
</I>&gt;<i> looking for grids with a currency system geared for fame and fortune.
</I>&gt;<i> However, there a few aspects of OSGrid which make it the ideal Hypergrid
</I>&gt;<i> nexus:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. It's completely free and open, even in it's content and services.
</I>&gt;<i> Anyone can land there, pick up a folder load of freebies, meet people who
</I>&gt;<i> can answer technical questions and hyperjump to many interesting locations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. It offers OpenSim newcomers a chance to connect to a functioning grid
</I>&gt;<i> and learn the basic ins and outs of roll your own regions before striking
</I>&gt;<i> out on their own and setting up standalone grids.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Barring a major malfunction of the main servers, there will always be
</I>&gt;<i> some part of OSGrid up and running.  This is not always the case with
</I>&gt;<i> independent grids as we've all experienced.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Given the first three points and probably several other benefits that go
</I>&gt;<i> unmentioned, it would be far easier for people to relocate their grids (of
</I>&gt;<i> considerably less size and complexity) closer to OSGrid than the other way
</I>&gt;<i> around.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is *my* reason for placing my grid around 8000, 8000 and I know there
</I>&gt;<i> are others who do likewise.  If grid owners/managers prefer to remain below
</I>&gt;<i> 4096 they can and should place intermediate jump parcels accordingly.
</I>&gt;<i> What's one extra jump in the entire process?  I've taken the subway to and
</I>&gt;<i> from work and other locations for years with line changes as part of my
</I>&gt;<i> daily commute.  My only other option would be to move closer to work - I
</I>&gt;<i> choose not to. I guess I view that and hypergrid travel in the same light -
</I>&gt;<i> an invaluable convenience, imperfect in it's design, but unmatched by any
</I>&gt;<i> alternatives within the given framework.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Just my 0.02 USD ;)

</I>&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  I'm having some trouble hypergridding FROM FleepGrid, though it appears
</I>&gt;<i> many folks are able to hypergrid TO FleepGrid just fine.  In testing, I've
</I>&gt;<i> not yet been able to successfully hypergrid out of FleepGrid to any
</I>&gt;<i> destination, and I'm having a lot of confusion about the 4096 limitation to
</I>&gt;<i> figure out suitable grids/regions to try to teleport to so I can chase down
</I>&gt;<i> what's going wrong.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  In the course of trying to chase down the problem, I've got several
</I>&gt;<i> questions that I'm hoping someone on the list can either answer or point me
</I>&gt;<i> to better resources for finding the answers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  QUESTION 1:  I understand Diva is encouraging everyone to relocate their
</I>&gt;<i> sims to centers less than 4096,4096 and I understand why based on this blog
</I>&gt;<i> post - The 4096 &quot;Bug&quot;: <A HREF="http://metaverseink.com/blog/?p=222">http://metaverseink.com/blog/?p=222</A>  It appears
</I>&gt;<i> many people are NOT changing their coords to the lower centers, is there a
</I>&gt;<i> reason why?  If I'm reading Diva's post correctly, the limitation is not
</I>&gt;<i> going to go away any time soon so I'm wondering why folks aren't changing
</I>&gt;<i> them to make hypergridding easier for travelers..  I haven't changed them on
</I>&gt;<i> FleepGrid yet either (9000,9000) and trying to decide what's the best course
</I>&gt;<i> to take both for FleepGrid and for the University of Cincinnati grid we're
</I>&gt;<i> about to install.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  QUESTION 2:  If people aren't going to change to lower centers, then
</I>&gt;<i> don't we all need to publish the region centers in addition to the HG
</I>&gt;<i> address in order for travelers to know whether they can make the jump or
</I>&gt;<i> not?  I'm finding <A HREF="http://www.hyperica.com/complete-grid-list/">http://www.hyperica.com/complete-grid-list/</A> completely
</I>&gt;<i> unhelpful as a directory because I don't know the region centers or
</I>&gt;<i>  opensim/hg versions for most of the destinations.  So when my jump fails, I
</I>&gt;<i> don't know if it's a problem on my end or because the region was too far
</I>&gt;<i> away or because it's on a different version than me.   The Hypergrid Mall is
</I>&gt;<i> another example, <A HREF="http://hypergridmall.com/">http://hypergridmall.com/</A> - Right on the front page it
</I>&gt;<i> has the hypergrid address, but no center coords or version info, so when my
</I>&gt;<i> jump fails, I don't know why.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  QUESTION 3:  I'm completely confused about the correct formatting for a
</I>&gt;<i> hypergrid URL.  I've seen so many variations!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="secondlife://domain.com:8002:RegionName">secondlife://domain.com:8002:RegionName</A>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://domain.com:8002:RegionName">http://domain.com:8002:RegionName</A>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://hg.domain.com:8002:RegionName">http://hg.domain.com:8002:RegionName</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Also not sure about proper formatting for region names with spaces in
</I>&gt;<i> them, is a &quot;%20&quot; required or not?  Which of the following is correct?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://domain.com:8002:Region%20Name">http://domain.com:8002:Region%20Name</A>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://domain.com:8002:Region">http://domain.com:8002:Region</A> Name
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://domain.com:8002:">http://domain.com:8002:</A> Region Name
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  QUESTION 4:  FleepGrid is running OpenSim 0.7.1 Release (interface
</I>&gt;<i> version 7) and FleepGrid Plaza is centered at 9000,9000 currently, but I
</I>&gt;<i> also have a Hypergate region at 5000,5000 and 13000,13000.  If you're
</I>&gt;<i> running a compatible version of opensim and theoretically I SHOULD be able
</I>&gt;<i> to hypergrid to your destination, can you reply with the address so I can
</I>&gt;<i> give it a try on a known &quot;should work&quot; region?  I'm finding so many broken
</I>&gt;<i> addresses and links and things I'm going crazy trying to figure out what's
</I>&gt;<i> wrong with hypergridding out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  ................
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  I've reviewed the wiki pages <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Hypergrid">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Hypergrid</A> and
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Installing_and_Running_Hypergrid">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Installing_and_Running_Hypergrid</A> but I'm
</I>&gt;<i> obviously still confused about some things.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Thanks in advance for your thoughts or suggestions, and sorry if I'm
</I>&gt;<i> behind the curve..
