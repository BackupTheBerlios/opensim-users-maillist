<PRE>That's actually a very plausible explanation. Probably if that step
were placed a bit later in the connection process would fix it. That
is, check to see which grid the viewer is pointing to before sending
the ping, and then only send that ping if it's aimed at SL. Sounds
like a basic if-then statement might solve it, but then I'm no
programmer! Who knows, LL might even appreciate recovering the
bandwidth that must burn. Although, it does allow them to keep an eye
on their competition...
