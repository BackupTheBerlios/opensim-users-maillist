<PRE>OK, I've been working with Camila on this problem and now have a
slightly more focused problem that hopefully someone can help us with.
Camila, please tell us if my description is wrong.

It seems like Camila's grid has no available HTTP-in URLs, as reported
by llGetFreeURLs().

I suggested that she increase the number allocated using a method
that's worked for other people before and restart the server. My
assumption is that if there's something else using all the URLs the
grid restart should fix it, at least temporarily, and even if it
doesn't the increased number of URLs allocated should give her some
headroom at least for the time it takes to test. To increase the
number available, I had her try adding:
[LL-Functions]
 max_external_urls_per_simulator = 1600
...but that didn't seem to make any difference.

Is there anywhere else we should be looking?
