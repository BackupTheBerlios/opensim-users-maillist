<PRE>Thank you Justin for the reply.  I sort of figured that would be the 
case.  Interestingly though, I usually run XAMPP Lite for OpenSim, and 
generally start Apache when I start MySQL, though I know Apache is 
unnecessary for normal OpenSim access and usage.

I might look into serving them from the Apache server, since it is part 
of the whole package I use.  I hadn't thought about the fact my 
configuration has its own http server.  :)

You are right though, it would place a bit more stress on the overall 
system.

I'd planned to use a much more lightweight solution than XAMPP, but the 
light bulb over my head wants to experiment with serving up the video 
from localhost...
I appreciate the feedback.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is there a way for me to place these video clips locally within an

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OpenSim folder (like Diva Distro) and offer that as a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> zip file it would be really great.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The video files themselves are small and only add about 30 megs max 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to the overall size of the final product if I can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> get this to work.  I just don't want them hosted elsewhere in the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> event there's a future issue with that host, thereby
