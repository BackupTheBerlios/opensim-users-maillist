<PRE>Hello, this is a bit weird, and I was wondering if anyone has this 
issue, or knows what might be happening.

I have started to really get some building done on my grid.  I have been 
making items that I will use all over my 56 regions.   I have been using 
a test region to build them close to each other making sure they all 
look good together.  I have this nice Ryukyuan 17th century village 
coming along nice.  The Sim has a beach front to open ocean water.  I 
had no troubles with that.  Have not seen any strange lighting effect.

Today, I wanted to display my Asian Style bridge, along with everything 
else, so I created a river in my landscape.  Here is the problem: After 
night fall, even at midnight, I started to notice it more, but right at 
water level on the land going into the water was a bright red glow.  I 
use the highest setting available to me on Firestorm.  I build 
realistically.  I hate builds, I have seen, that set trees and plants to 
full bright and glowing.  Living matter isn't supposed to glow!  
Exceptions tend to be glow worms and some kind of fish.  I've turned the 
allow face lights off completely. Wish I could do that in SL too.  
People with high powered video cards with local lighting can't see with 
everything bleached out like that.  The only things on my grid that 
light up, are the lights.  None of which are below ground, and cover the 
entire region from underneath .

Though it looks as if I made a full bright, red glowing ball someplace, 
and left it under ground.  It would have to be huge by how much light I 
see on that river bank.  Is this a bug already in Mantis, or something I 
may have done wrong?  Is it somethiing about loking up from underwater, 
any ideas folks?

Please save my sanity.  ;)

InuYasha.
