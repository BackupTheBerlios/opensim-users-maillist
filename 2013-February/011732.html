<PRE>Um, I so feel like I am about to fall into some kind of hole here, but I 
for one don't have any idea of what you speak of.  I am probably out of 
the loop on this one.  I am still building up my assets for my own 
separate grid.  The only reason I have decided a long time ago I wanted 
a grid scaled to realistic height, Asian, and in a specific time 
period.  I met many people interested in my grid and will come take a 
look and hoping it will be their second home.  OSGrid has always been 
the place I have logged into just to see how well the next version of 
Opensim is running before I work so hard to upgrade to the next version.

Being that I am not on Hypergrid or using Opensim to connect to the 
OSGrid asset service, I haven't noticed any administrative issues.  I 
would appreciate hearing why you feel this way.  If it is lack of 
regions and or people, it might be because many are currently attempting 
to upgrade to the new newer version and haven't had time to get 
reconnected.

Just my two cents worth.
