<PRE>Unless I'm mistaken, I know I cannot &quot;import&quot; a video to be used 
in-world, but...

I've used video-on-a-prim for years and always used a referral URL for 
the video file called from my own hosted website.  However, I'm working 
on a project that has some short video clips along with slides and the 
usual fluff for an interactive in-world tutorial.

I'd like the video clips to be embedded somehow so they are not called 
from a web-based URL.

Is there a way for me to place these video clips locally within an 
OpenSim folder, for example, and have them called from there to play 
in-world?  I understand that I can't include the video clips themselves 
in an OAR, unless I'm mistaken.  But if I can at least include them in a 
pre-configured OpenSim folder (like Diva Distro) and offer that as a zip 
file it would be really great.

The video files themselves are small and only add about 30 megs max to 
the overall size of the final product if I can get this to work.  I just 
don't want them hosted elsewhere in the event there's a future issue 
with that host, thereby making them inaccessible in-world.

Thanks for any suggestions.
</PRE>
