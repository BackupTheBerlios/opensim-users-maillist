<PRE>Trying to create a new grid in Firestorm for a new opens instance that I created
for students. OpenSim was downloaded last week and built on a Ubuntu machine.
I've successfully logged into it from an older viewer so the network seems to be
up. I thought I'd try Firestorm since others have said it was a newer viewer (more
advanced graphics options).

However, I cannot seem to create a new opensim grid. I go to Firestorm, Viewer-&gt;
Preferences and then &quot;Add New Grid&quot;, and enter my grid URL with the usual
&quot;:9000&quot; suffix. Firestorm seems to like it as when I  hit &quot;apply&quot; it doesn't complain
that the grid does not exist, however, it doesn't create any new entries in the grid
list (&quot;Manage Grids&quot; list). I also have a cloud as my avatar, which is another issue
which happened on an older viewer but may (or may not) happen in Firestorm.
Anyone notice this issue with adding a new OpenSim grid to Firestorm?
