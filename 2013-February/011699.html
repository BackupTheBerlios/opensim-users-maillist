<PRE>Hi Justin,

I have located the commit where the issue began to show up; Commit 
b977f9 (r/20586). I also tested a couple of commits before it to be 
certain and in those commits the issue does not appear.

Thank you!

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hello all,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm running OpenSim commit fd34a75 (r/21883) and am noticing some 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> oddness with playing and stopping animations. If I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> play an animation from inventory and then stop it, it will appear 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that my avatar is frozen in the last frame that was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> played before stopping instead of returning the avatar to the state 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that was in before the new animation was played. If
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am playing and stopping animations from a script (such as an AO for 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> instance); when the animation is stopped it will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> appear to keep playing until another animation is played after it. In 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> both cases the weirdness with the stopped
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> animation(s) will persist until some other animation is played 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> whether it be another inventory animation or a default
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> avatar movement animation. It doesn't seem to matter which animation 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is played from inventory / script.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For  a script it can sort of being worked around by doing this:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> llStartAnimation(&quot;some_anim_name&quot;);
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ... Later on when it needs to be stopped ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> llStopAnimation(&quot;some_anim_name&quot;);
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> llStartAnimation(&quot;stand&quot;);
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> llStopAnimation(&quot;stand&quot;);
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It gives the appearance that the animation is stopped; but I'm 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thinking that it's simply just overriding the stuck
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> animation long enough to put a apply a new animation to the avatar to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;unstick&quot; it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Its not an issue when the script plays one animation after another 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but if it's a one time animation that needs to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stopped the results can look really funny.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> On a side note... I notice that when I attempt to play the same 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> animation again with out first playing a different
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> animation, the current playing animation won't appear to restart like 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it previously did not too long ago. I noticed this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in my synced pose ball script that has a sync command which would 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> simply play the poseball anim again when an avatar sat
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on it (sends a link message to other linked pose balls to tell them 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> all to play the animation again) in attempt to sync
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> up the animations of multiple avatars sitting on the link set.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Previously my sync function looked like this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sync()
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> {
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      llStopAnimation(anim);
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      llStartAnimation(anim);
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Then had to change it to this once the animation issue started 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> appearing to get it to work again
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sync()
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> {
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      llStopAnimation(anim);
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      llStartAnimation(&quot;stand&quot;);
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      llStopAnimation(&quot;stand&quot;);
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      llStartAnimation(anim);
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is any one else experiencing this?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
