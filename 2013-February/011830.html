<PRE>I'm not sure what you're asking here.  Regions don't have descriptions.  If you're asking about changing the region name 
on the fly then that isn't possible (and I don't think that's likely to change very soon).

I'm not sure why windlight changes aren't working for you.  You might want to file a Mantis.
