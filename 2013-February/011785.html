<PRE>Hmm that kinda sounds to me like a windlight sky and/or water setting 
gone awry in your viewer. Have you tried setting your sky and water 
settings back to their defaults? And maybe also see if it does it on 
other viewers? I wouldn't know really as far as Firestorm is concerned; 
I can't stand using Viewer 2/3 based viewers on OpenSim (I can barely 
stand using them on SL =P)

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Though it looks as if I made a full bright, red glowing ball

</I>&gt;<i> or something I may have done wrong?  Is it somethiing about loking up 
</I>&gt;<i> from underwater, any ideas folks?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please save my sanity.  ;)
