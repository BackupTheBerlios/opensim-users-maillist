<PRE>Hi Chris.  I tried to reproduce the playing issues issues on 9588328 which should be identical to fd34a75 with respect 
to animations.

However, I was not able to do so - animations appear to reset correctly when stopped in mid-animate on both LL 1.23.5 
and LL 3.3.4, for both one's own viewer and for observing avatars.

I think the next step would be to open a mantis so that we can investigate further - some of the animation logic has 
changed recently.  As usual, if you could upload running scripts to recreate the issue and perhaps the animation itself 
(if not confidential) then that would be very helpful, as would identifying the exact OpenSimulator commit where the 
behaviour changed if possible.

Animations are particularly sensitive to things such as animation overrides so it might be worth reviewing whether these 
are active on either client or server-side (where both approaches work rather differently).

&gt;<i> Hello all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm running OpenSim commit fd34a75 (r/21883) and am noticing some oddness with playing and stopping animations. If I
</I>&gt;<i> play an animation from inventory and then stop it, it will appear that my avatar is frozen in the last frame that was
</I>&gt;<i> played before stopping instead of returning the avatar to the state that was in before the new animation was played. If
</I>&gt;<i> I am playing and stopping animations from a script (such as an AO for instance); when the animation is stopped it will
</I>&gt;<i> appear to keep playing until another animation is played after it. In both cases the weirdness with the stopped
</I>&gt;<i> animation(s) will persist until some other animation is played whether it be another inventory animation or a default
</I>&gt;<i> avatar movement animation. It doesn't seem to matter which animation is played from inventory / script.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For  a script it can sort of being worked around by doing this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> llStartAnimation(&quot;some_anim_name&quot;);
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ... Later on when it needs to be stopped ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> llStopAnimation(&quot;some_anim_name&quot;);
</I>&gt;<i> llStartAnimation(&quot;stand&quot;);
</I>&gt;<i> llStopAnimation(&quot;stand&quot;);
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It gives the appearance that the animation is stopped; but I'm thinking that it's simply just overriding the stuck
</I>&gt;<i> animation long enough to put a apply a new animation to the avatar to &quot;unstick&quot; it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Its not an issue when the script plays one animation after another but if it's a one time animation that needs to be
</I>&gt;<i> stopped the results can look really funny.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On a side note... I notice that when I attempt to play the same animation again with out first playing a different
</I>&gt;<i> animation, the current playing animation won't appear to restart like it previously did not too long ago. I noticed this
</I>&gt;<i> in my synced pose ball script that has a sync command which would simply play the poseball anim again when an avatar sat
</I>&gt;<i> on it (sends a link message to other linked pose balls to tell them all to play the animation again) in attempt to sync
</I>&gt;<i> up the animations of multiple avatars sitting on the link set.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Previously my sync function looked like this
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> sync()
</I>&gt;<i> {
</I>&gt;<i>      llStopAnimation(anim);
</I>&gt;<i>      llStartAnimation(anim);
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then had to change it to this once the animation issue started appearing to get it to work again
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> sync()
</I>&gt;<i> {
</I>&gt;<i>      llStopAnimation(anim);
</I>&gt;<i>      llStartAnimation(&quot;stand&quot;);
</I>&gt;<i>      llStopAnimation(&quot;stand&quot;);
</I>&gt;<i>      llStartAnimation(anim);
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is any one else experiencing this?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks!
</I>&gt;<i>
