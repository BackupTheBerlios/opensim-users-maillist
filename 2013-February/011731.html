<PRE>Hello there,

in the light of some fundamental personal changes which happened during 
the last few weeks in OSgrid, namely the head administration, there are 
big changes going on and still underway, changing the atmosphere in 
there at great lengths, since big parts of the user base have been 
alienated by the administration.

Changes which already drove great parts of the well grown and 
established community there out of the grid. Changes which made the 
community suffering.

Changes, if they are still going on at that level and if the resulting 
drain continues, could render OSgrid finally useless as official 
testgrid for Opensimulator because of a mostly non existant user base then.

So my simple question is: which grid is going to be the next official 
test grid for Opensimulator just in case OSgrid is going to run further 
down the hill quite as it alrady has done? Or are there going to be more 
official test grids in the future at the same time?

Greetings,
Bart

</PRE>
