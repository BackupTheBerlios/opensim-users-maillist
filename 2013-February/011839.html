<PRE>Okay, you're talking about the land (parcel) description, not a whole region description.  You could indeed set and get 
this using the osParcelSetDetails()/llParcelGetDetails().  However, as Garmin suggested, you're probably better off 
using the description field of an object hidden somewhere on the sim.

At some point in the future we may have a script facility for storing somewhat larger chunks of data in objects than the 
255 character limit of Description fields.  However, this option currently requires more design thought, imho.
