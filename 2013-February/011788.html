<PRE>I doubt this is an OpenSimulator bug.

In OpenSimulator 0.7.5 there are some commands which can list objects by position.  For instance, the command

  show object pos ,,-~ ,,30

would show all objects between the ground and 30 metres height.

Unfortunately, in 0.7.5 the command was not parsed properly.  The help states that you want to say

  show object pos ,,-~ to ,,30

but actually the 'to' has to be left out.  This is fixed in current git master.

Ultimately, I think it would be nice to have some kind of query language to identify objects rather than ad hoc options.
