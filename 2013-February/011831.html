<PRE>I meant when you use a viewer, you have the option of looking at &quot;About 
Land&quot;.  Under that window you can change the name of the sim, it shows 
the UUID under that and then there is a small box for a description.    
In the same way you can edit an item or object.  The description can be 
chnaged in both SL and Opensim using a script.  I just wanted to know if 
anyone knew enough about some new OS commands that let you do the same.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> knew I would notice that change greatly.  The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> variable changed, I checked and the returned value said it did. Using 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Firestorm, and Kokua to test, still no visual
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> change to me.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Still adding &quot;/*Sky:&quot;Blizzard&quot;Water:&quot;[TOR] Subtleties&quot;*/&quot; chnages my
