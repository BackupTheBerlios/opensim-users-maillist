<PRE>I ran the suggested test using half of my regions, 24 of them.  I can't 
run two instances of Firestorm and my entire grid at once at least for 
now.  I was foreced to hit CTRL-ALT-R at the very start. Not only have I 
found your problem seems to exist, but the first avatar to log into an 
instance sees itself as fine, and will see the next avatar to appear in 
the same instance and region, but the new avatar takes a while to rez 
and can't see the avatar that logged in just in before them.  I hit the 
CTRL-ALT-R so I could start the steps before crossing the border with 
two avatars that could at least see each other to begin with.  That 
itself is a growing problem,  when I start to have larger groups of 
visitors it will be ver bothersome.

Once I logged both avatars, my wife's as well as mine, I used the 
&quot;appearance show command&quot;, on my avatar as follows.

Region (root) # appearance show InuYasha Meiji
For InuYasha Meiji in Hantagawa
Bake Type  UUID

Hair       05c9335f-73fa-4370-b5e8-c4670b773cfa (uploaded)
InuYasha Meiji baked appearance texture is OK

I left my wife's avatar standing on the first instance on the region and 
then walked across to the next region, nearby to the next instance and 
got this result.  This time neither of us lost the other's textures.  It 
could be because I rebaked before when we shared the same instance and 
region.  Also I am using the same machine to log on to each of our 
accounts.  Checking the &quot;appearance show command&quot; now, on the region and 
instance I just moved onto... Different from the one my wife's avatar is 
standing.  Even though in the newest Firestome v4.3.1. 31155 (opensim 
version) I use, bpth see each other.  The results do show an issue. here...

Region (root) # appearance show InuYasha Meiji
For InuYasha Meiji in Shuri Village
Bake Type  UUID
Head       not set
UpperBody  not set
LowerBody  not set
Eyes       not set

InuYasha Meiji baked appearance texture is corrupt
Region (root) #

I hope this test helps.

Your Friend,
InuYasha

</I>&gt;<i> Thank you for the time you put in helping me figuring out what is

</I>&gt;<i> I have tried several avatar textures as you suggested previously 
</I>&gt;<i> (including a Linda Kellie type and the default &quot;Ruth&quot;).
</I>&gt;<i> I have tried this with avatars which have been in use for a longer 
</I>&gt;<i> period and new created avatars.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is consistently the same and best illustated as follows:
</I>&gt;<i> Step 1: Log in as avatar A in opensim instance X
</I>&gt;<i> Control 1: Console command in instance X: appearance show avatarname
</I>&gt;<i> Step 2: Walk into an adjacent region  in an other opensim instance &quot;Y&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> (do not bake, teleport or edit appearance!)
</I>&gt;<i> Control 2: Console command in instance Y: appearance show avatarname
</I>&gt;<i> Step 3: Log in as avatar B in either X or Y
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My Result: A can see B normally, but B sees A as a cloud.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And yes, a baking action by A resolves the problem. But A does not 
</I>&gt;<i> know he is a cloud unless he is told.
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately in my setup avatars do walk around and are supposed to 
</I>&gt;<i> cross regions walking.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can see:
</I>&gt;<i> in the consoles that all avatars (old new, fancy or standard) lose (or 
</I>&gt;<i> do not get) textures when walking into another opensim instance The 
</I>&gt;<i> console reports appearance corrupt.
</I>&gt;<i> Zen and Firestorm show a normal avatar once the other avatar has OK 
</I>&gt;<i> appearance in console, even if they walk across a boundary and the 
</I>&gt;<i> console reports corrupt. This stays true unless they walk out of 
</I>&gt;<i> visual range and return. Than they show as cloud.
</I>&gt;<i> If a second avatar logs in and the present avatar has previously 
</I>&gt;<i> walked across a region/sim boundary, than second avatar will see the 
</I>&gt;<i> already present avatar as a cloud. Only ctr-alt-r, appearance edit or 
</I>&gt;<i> teleport of the already present avatar resolves this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I prefer being wrong, however at this point I do not think it is a 
</I>&gt;<i> texture problem, but a bug.
</I>&gt;<i> I hate filing bug reports without proper confirmation of the problem 
</I>&gt;<i> so I would very much appreciate it if the readers who are:
</I>&gt;<i> running in Grid mode
</I>&gt;<i> and have two regions adjacent to each other  running in separate 
</I>&gt;<i> opensim servers
</I>&gt;<i> to test step 1,2,3 and let me know what they see.
