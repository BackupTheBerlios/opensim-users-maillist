<PRE>I was thinking, since I am having issues getting the windshare scripts 
to work, although they compile.  I am still trying to use 
windlight/windshare for a better weather system.  I was wondering if 
there is a way in a script to change or add to a region description, 
like you can use scripting to change and read and write to an object 
description.  Because everything works the way I would expect when using 
things like /*Sky:&quot;Blizzard&quot;Water:&quot;[TOR] Subtleties&quot;*/.  Maybe when a 
storm is in the air I could chnage my normal region descripting to add 
&quot;/*Sky:&quot;Blizzard&quot;Water:&quot;[TOR] Subtleties&quot;*/&quot; to the end, then remove it 
when the storm is over?

It was only a thought since this can be does with objects.  Any ideas?  
Or has the Issue in Mantis been fixed?  I am not even sure if it has 
anything to do with my problem with scripting windshare. The example 
scripts compile, and they say succes when complete.  I got the setting 
variable I wanted, changed it, then check to see what the get windlight 
script said, and the change saved.  I even set my water to black, 
because I knew I would notice that change greatly.  The variable 
changed, I checked and the returned value said it did.  Using Firestorm, 
and Kokua to test, still no visual change to me.

Still adding &quot;/*Sky:&quot;Blizzard&quot;Water:&quot;[TOR] Subtleties&quot;*/&quot; chnages my 
view instantly walking into and out of a region.  I am still using 7.4, 
is it me, or a bug?  IF I could get this to work, I find this a muc 
beter way then partical clouds to create storm and rain cloouds if this 
would only work.
