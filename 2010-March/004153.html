</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    Mayby its not the same thing as OSWiredux? anyway thats a huge hurdle

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This troubles me too, as I have a couple of small grids that need a web

</I>&gt;<i> discouraged by how horribly complicated it is to install. Even if I can 
</I>&gt;<i> eventually make it to work, I will never be able to teach people how to 
</I>&gt;<i> make it work. It's really horrible!
</I>&gt;<i>  + I ran drupal for about a year just as normal web site. I can say its
</I>&gt;<i> verry PICKY!
</I>&gt;<i>  + and making your own addins is well for the bird's
</I>&gt;<i>  + Also i think its way overkill for opensimulator's need's and to re-make
</I>&gt;<i> it.. NAHHH! lol
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I took a look at OSWiredux and I was also discouraged. It seems too 
</I>&gt;<i> complicated. But that doesn't mean that OSWiredux is dead. Someone with 
</I>&gt;<i> enough PHP knowledge should be able to fix it to work with the new DB 
</I>&gt;<i> schema -- just a few table/field name changes, and it should be
</I>&gt;<i> salvageable.
</I>&gt;<i>  + Were still using wi-redux, so far we have managed to keep it working
</I>&gt;<i> but sounds like the same thing needs done there too.
</I>&gt;<i>  + Well like you said alot of other things have to be done and im shure if
</I>&gt;<i> theres a need some clever soul will comeup with something :)
</I>&gt;<i>  + In the mean time im ok poking it with a stick for now, what were
</I>&gt;<i> allready running is doing fine for folks so theres no rush to switch
</I>&gt;<i> anything.
