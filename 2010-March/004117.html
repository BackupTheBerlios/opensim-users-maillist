The point is that if you run &quot;development&quot; software for &quot;production&quot; you
WILL have problems!

One of the subtle differences between OpenSource development &quot;closed source&quot;
development is that &quot;there is no bottom to the rabbit hole&quot;! You can change
anything and run the most unstable &quot;bleeding edge&quot; software imaginable.

Commercial (&quot;closed source&quot;) software does not get released until much later
in the design cycle. If OpenSim were &quot;closed source&quot; then likely V0.6.7
would be &quot;production&quot; and V 0.6.8 would be &quot;beta&quot; - if indeed ANY of it was
allowed outside the factory!

Essentially the difference is that you get to make the choice and live with
the results!

If you are prepared for things a lot more subtle than the April 1 pranks to
go wrong then running the &quot;head&quot; revision helps the developers by testing
the software in a realistic environment using &quot;standard idiots&quot; as uisers.

If you are trying to build a virtual world and want to concentrate on
getting stuff built and working &quot;in world&quot; then you should be using one of
the release versions!

Just because the nightly builds or &quot;head&quot; version doesn't break often does *
not* mean that they won't break!

The April 1 antics should serve as a reminder of this!

Well for me last year was a matter of not knowing what was beeing reffered
too.
It was at the same time as real virus threat was bbeing warrned about and me
not knowing exactly what it was. Thought that thay were talking about a
trick on OSG users or a joke just between devs ect..
I never considered it would be done in the master svn code.
When i saw that something was wrong, It became a series of things as i
dident know and made the worst assumption and that my system had been hacked
and nothing todo with the build.

Anyway, For me it came down to just not knowing what was beeing reffered
too.
I really dident care about the prank its selph. At the same time there were
some that seemed to be using it as an excuse to make alot of trouble. Im
shure theres some that remeber that too. 
New ppl may be getting the wrong impression and dont know what scars there
were from then.

In hindsight (now that i know) its not a big deal and is done to have fun.
It doset make it into tagged rev. it dosent harm data or have some black
hidden stuff in it. Its just a joke and lives for one day in a dev. git
build is all.

The sky is not falling :)  Have some fun if its done at all this year.
