This troubles me too, as I have a couple of small grids that need a web 
front end. I've been looking at Drupal this morning, but I was 
discouraged by how horribly complicated it is to install. Even if I can 
eventually make it to work, I will never be able to teach people how to 
make it work. It's really horrible!

I took a look at OSWiredux and I was also discouraged. It seems too 
complicated. But that doesn't mean that OSWiredux is dead. Someone with 
enough PHP knowledge should be able to fix it to work with the new DB 
schema -- just a few table/field name changes, and it should be salvageable.
