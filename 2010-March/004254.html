OSG 'Opensim Grid' has and will be the rock as it allways has. I run my own
grid, have for a verry long time as a so called closed grid. Nether in
anyway excuses us from contributing to the Opensimulator project as a whole.
Closed grids are more than you may know. 1st of thay wholy depend on the
content that makes it attractive, the walled part is to maintain the
security of that content. It is in no way a GO AWAY WE DONT WANT YAH. We do
and allways have and will contrib. to cause as best we can. We share whats
relevant with core devs same as OSG. We spend as many hrs days.. bug hunting
for the global project.
Plz dont mix apples and oranges when it comes to mode of operation. 
Were all in the same boat we all do our part!
Git head is ment for Developent simple as that. I think theres some mixed
messages to all this though. Ppl need a forum to talk about whatever mode or
rev thay use. Its how we colaberate and sometimes as a group get things
done. To suppress ANY feedback about any REV isant a good idea. Devs can
ignore our chatter too, not suppress it.
If opensimulator as a project is to grow everyone should be able to talk
about it. Its not a matter of beeing right or wrong, its about getting it
done.
