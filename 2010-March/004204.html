<PRE>If I'm not wrong, 2 years ago or so, someone did a script for DAZ for
exporting to BVH-SL format. I tested it and worked quite well.
Unfortunately I didn't save the script on a safe place :-(

It was a message in the SL forums.

Does anyone remember where to get that script?

</I>&gt;<i>    My sources , we're  not a discrete package that is distributed .  My
</I>&gt;<i> sources are my collaborative contacts that I have assembled after many years
</I>&gt;<i> in   virtual reality .   I cant actually list the names of people that do
</I>&gt;<i> work for me since that would be unethical and thus not part of the corporate
</I>&gt;<i> culture that we keep .    Another part of the source is my own work .
</I>&gt;<i> Animations are time consuming and I am tied up with some  tasks with my grid
</I>&gt;<i> right now ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I am sorry if I confused some of you into thinking there was a package
</I>&gt;<i> out there that you could get .  The sources I mentioned we're my compatriots
</I>&gt;<i> and myself...  I simply found collaboration with others in the wider
</I>&gt;<i> community to be a better source than a package of some sort .
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   IF you guys need animations ,  I can get them to you in bvh file format
</I>&gt;<i> but I would need to know what I am getting myself into , before I can commit
</I>&gt;<i> to a task .    Please understand that it is going to take time to do some of
</I>&gt;<i> this task ,  depending on what you want .    Motion capture animations are
</I>&gt;<i> probably not going to be part of a package so if you are looking for those
</I>&gt;<i> specifically , then im probably not going to be able to assist in that task
</I>&gt;<i> .
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   Since there is a great deal  in this for us   ( time , money) ...  There
</I>&gt;<i> would have to be a barter made in order  to secure the animations for your
</I>&gt;<i> grid(s)  .   If somebody out there reading this is  willing to assist us
</I>&gt;<i> with information technology  tasks  and needs that we may have ,   we will
</I>&gt;<i> be more than willing to assist in any way that we can in return .    But we
</I>&gt;<i> have too much work to do on our grid  at this point in time , for us to give
</I>&gt;<i> freely of our time and talents .
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   I am sorry for those that may have thought that there was something
</I>&gt;<i> available to them free .
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   If some one out there is interested in seeing what kind of solution we can
</I>&gt;<i> be for your animations needs and  If you are willing to  donate some of your
</I>&gt;<i> time and talents  to us  in return for us donating some of our time and
</I>&gt;<i> talents to you ,  then please  contact me via  private  email , since its
</I>&gt;<i> beyond the scope of this topic at that point .
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   For those that are still interested ,  we will have to discuss what your
</I>&gt;<i> needs are before  we can commit...  I am probably only going to compile
</I>&gt;<i> Opensim human like animations at this time , so if you have a need for a
</I>&gt;<i> moving dragon you are probably out of luck ...   You more than likely won't
</I>&gt;<i> be getting motion capture animations  ....  These are going to be hand made
</I>&gt;<i> creations  that convey emotion in an SL context .
