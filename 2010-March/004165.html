We are actualy going thru things mutch quicker than i though so i was able to
test the addons

OsSearch and OsProfile both work as thay use to.
The problem comes from NOT updating them to the current SVN. Thay have been
patched for current git and work fine on 9fa9cfd - r12384.

The gotcha (got me anyway) was if you donot update them and build it. it
leaves JUNK in the bin folder so evan if you find that out, and remove them,
it still wount build.

Update them b4 you build anything and your good to go :)

Opencurrency has not been updated and should not be used right now. No doubt
it will also leave junk in the trunk. Im shure updates to it will happen
eventualy as its used quite a bit.

We have checked Mega-region,avie clothing persistance (basic),MRM,assorted
LSL scripts, and cars. All work as thay do on our production grid. 

Next will be heavy region's loads (thay cover about everything from parcles
to verry complex objects and scripts). About 80k prims and not shure how
many scripts but is a common load we use when testing (makes the fans spin
really good).

OAR and other stuff will have to wait a bit.
Anyway just an update to our progress sofar and might help keep others from
stumbling over the same stumps at the same time.
