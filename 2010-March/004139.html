<PRE>Everyone -

The official tagged release is 0.6.9. Please stick to that unless you 
want to help the development of OpenSim. If you just want to use it, 
stay  in tagged releases.

If you do want to help, your help will be much appreciated. Here are 
some important tips and warnings for upgrading your grids:

1) We're not in Kansas anymore. If your grid is more than just a 
personal world for fun, I strongly recommend that you pull a copy of 
your DB onto the side and try the upgrade on a &quot;test grid&quot; first. You 
should start integrating this 2-phase deployment process more and more 
into your operation. (besides doing backups periodically)

2) In theory, migrations occur automatically, but you may encounter some 
hickups -- see this issue report, which isn't solved yet, but has some 
tips at the end: <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=4604.">http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=4604.</A>

3) Expect bugs in master for the next couple of weeks. We're in pre-0.7 
phase, after a massive re-architecting effort. Bug reports of the kind 
&quot;Here's something that doesn't look right, I want to help diagnose it&quot; 
are really valuable. Patches are even more valuable! Bug reports of the 
kind &quot;F*&amp;#@, this doesn't work and now I can't login, I can't roll back, 
and my life is in ruins&quot; will be left echoing in the void.

4) OSWiredux will not work anymore. If you rely on it for user 
registrations, consider finding an alternative solution before you 
upgrade your production grid. Ideally, you will deploy that alternative 
solution in your test grid before you deploy it into your production grid.

5) The default configuration now is 1 single ROBUST server with all the 
12-or-so services, and then any number of simulation servers. Depending 
on the scale of your operation, you may want to run the default 
configuration or not. If you have a really big grid, with lots of users, 
very likely you will want to separate groups of services into their own 
ROBUST servers, and placing those in their own boxes. With the new 
architecture, this is trivial to do. However, I haven't had time to 
write the documentation yet, so I won't be able to teach people how to 
do it right now. I already told a few things to the OSGrid folks over 
the IRC, so maybe they can figure it out and teach everyone else how to 
do it before I have time to document it properly.
