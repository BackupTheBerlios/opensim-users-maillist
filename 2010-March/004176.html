<PRE>I think I tried these before - it's important to note that to
successfully import to SL or OpenSim you only have certain joints to
animate, so fingers and toes, for example, won't animate. I think the
presence of animation information for extra joints may cause an import
to fail, so I would try importing to a tool like QAvimator or Animeeple
if a plain import to the grid doesn't work.

 

If these are the same ones that were posted around this list a couple of
months ago I did manage to get them into Daz studio and export with just
the SL-compatible joint set, BUT even though I managed to import some to
OpenSim, all the animations seemed to be a variation on a zombie dance -
not sure the conversion worked as planned! Fingers crossed someone else
has better luck J

Robert...

That's a great find!  since they are already .bvh files they don't need
converting.  They just need to be uploaded as an Animation.  **BUT**, I
just tried to upload one to Second Life and got the error message that
animation files must not be larger than 60K.  A quick scan of the first
set of .bvh files from the link you provided shows most of these files
are at least hundreds of kilobytes large.  Maybe they can be opened with
something like Avimator and edited down.  Or, as far as OpenSim goes,
maybe there is a config setting to allow larger Animation uploads.
Again, I haven't tried uploading to my OpenSim yet.  Mine's down this
morning.  Hopefully someone else can try.

Cheers!

Was anybody successful at converting these animations so we can use them
in
OpenSim? Seems like over 2500 animations would be worth the effort.
