When using RealXtend, you are also using OpenSim, because that is what 
is used as the server then. Just with a viewer that comes with VNC 
integration too. BTW a group of researchers at DMSLab in Korea, not 
affiliated with the ReX core team, have added interactive VNC use 
(mouse&amp;kb input) too the the old rexviewer recently (posted feb 2010): 
VNC in DMSViewer <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7wmgt8vbHU">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7wmgt8vbHU</A>

I guess you mean when using a SL viewer. Last august people demonstrated 
client side VNC in SLviewer as well, dunno if the LLMedia API is now in 
the 2.0 beta or what: <A HREF="http://nwn.blogs.com/nwn/2009/08/vpn-via-sl.html">http://nwn.blogs.com/nwn/2009/08/vpn-via-sl.html</A> 
(Virtual VNC: Remotely Control Computers From *Within* Second Life!)

With a viewer like current Hippo with no client side VNC support, it 
should be possible to run the VNC client in the Opensim server, and have 
that generate textures that any viewer can then show. So I'd say there 
is a way, at least if low fps (like 0.3 - 1?) is acceptable in this case 
too. OpenSim supports this kind of stuff in the LSL API with 
osSetDynamicTextureData and friends - 
<A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Dynamic_textures">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Dynamic_textures</A> .. so seems like would be 
feasible to make a vnc module that uses the same mechanism as those lsl 
calls do. I don't know how well it would work, you can perhaps test 
easily by making a script with those commands that draws some boxes and 
moves them around, and shows some texts and changes them, emulating a 
desktop :) or take a series of screenshots of your desktop and change 
those images using osSetDynamicTextureData to fake it to get a feel :o

VNC is more efficient 'cause it only transfers the changed parts, tiles 
of the whole shared display, whereas this server side solution would 
always need to update the whole display and hence be slower and heavier.
