<PRE>Lets try: . thanks to all the developers who sacrifice weeks, months and
years of their valuable time and skills to share their work for free to
unknown strangers. We truly appreciate what you do. We understand that you
could prioritize a well paid job and time with your family, but instead
choose to put your heart into a free product for the benefit of all, not
just focusing on yourself.

 

April fools should be taken seriously, so I think this is a good addition to
OpenSim. J

 

Of course the code is already in there. Nobody is accessing anything to do
anything. OpenSim does not contain backdoors, only standard security holes
that will be fixed when found.

And the point being that this is ALPHA software. This means that shit will
happen. This time you know when and where it will happen. J

 

BR,

 Tedd

I don't think you understand the relevance of what is going on. IF they can
put code into it to crash or disrupt your OpenSim software, then what else
is in the code that we are unaware of ? I see a HUGE security risk here.
Anyone who has this running at home on their home network, they invited them
into looking at your network and your computers. I have permanently shut
down my Grid. I no longer support OpenSim.

 

And they are correct when they say, This is not commercial software and that
THEY are not responsible for anything !

Why not just set your system clock back a day or so on April 1st until April
2nd to avoid it in the first place if you're using a dev release? Of course
that assumes OpenSim gets the time and date from the system rather than
NTP... I'm not sure lol.

As for the people who don't have a heads up on this I don't know what to
say.

Ok so let me get this straight..  since I am NOT the coder here of my
personal Sim as you put it, then I am to expect it to Fail or screw up
because the coders who you say &quot;Own&quot; the code ( which by that logic means
they own my sim ) can deliberately crash the sim all because of a Stupid
holiday prank ?  They deliberately put code in there to screw up EVERYONE
who has a sim that is a DEV version ? 

 

So all those poor people who have that, which I know a lot, will get a bad
surprise ( and not all of them are even IN this group ) ..  and some who
have been trying so hard to keep it running, are going to think that
something major is wrong on that day not thinking it was all a prank and
either A.) give up, or B.) loose all their faith in opensim because of this
crap ?

 

I'm sorry, but does this seem right to anyone here ?  Or is this something
that all of you are in agreement with here ?

The april 1 pranks typically only affect non-release versions of opensim and
have never, to my knowlege, crashed anyone's grid. 

 

More typically, everyone's avatar will be rendered as a stick figure or
plywood box. Again, these pranks typically only impact head.

 

Note that: 1. These pranks are a more than just a bit juvenile, but 2. the
code belongs to the devs who write it, not to the users who run it and 3.
Don't run dev code on prduction servers if you dont like surprises.

 

Oh and 4. don't expect a lot of sympathy about your 'getting pissed', as you
have been more than adequately warned.

 

Cheers,

James

   Beware, we have one month before April Fool's day. Gremlins have
   been known to appear in OpenSim on April Fool's day. If you have
   critical demo's on April 1st, don't use OpenSim! :-D You have been
   warned!
