</I>I honestly thought that thay were making something sp. for OSG to use as it
has the most users and there admins could safely use as it came from devs..
OR that devs had some branch thay use to play jokes on each other with, just
to lighten up there day.
I really dident understand at the time.

The real problem was when a few tryed to make mountains outta mole hills
back then. New users prob hit on a sore subject with someone and not know
thay have. The logic thay were using to make trouble with really dident get
passed the sniff test and isant anything new.
Truth is, nothing like that has ever happened in the 1st place. Dev. have rl
jobs programming to. There not going to risk that trust and there jobs. Not
to mention theres not just ONE dev there are many and thay to dont want
there living in question. So the logic of the old argument really had no
point other than to make trouble in my view.

Im saying this so new ppl can understand it a bit and why some answers may
seem odd to them when thay hit a sore spot. There are 2 sides to the story.
