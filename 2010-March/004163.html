To expand on that, basicly what has to happen it each instance need to have
its own set of free ports.
so if your ruuning them on the same box you will have to make the next above
the ones allready used.
For instance: A region thats using port 9000 cannot share it with another
also using the same one so the next would have tobe 9001 and so on. Same
would be true for all of the port numbers in your ini's too.
If thay are sep. like that then you can launch each and not collide with the
other one.
SA uses sqllite but is better to switch to mysql so it can be shared between
them.
Im not shure what you have allready read but alot of it hasent changed all
that mutch.

What rock has here:

is still correct.

There other options sutch as a dist called serverless grid as well as deva's
dist. can also be used.
HG can complicate matters a bit more but also can work fine.

It really is a matter of what way or expectations you have as to what you
want or need really.

Remember also you can run more than one region on the same instance, your
not just stuck with just one region and easyer todo.
