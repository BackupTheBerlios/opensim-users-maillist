<PRE>The point is that if you run &quot;development&quot; software for &quot;production&quot; you
WILL have problems!

One of the subtle differences between OpenSource development &quot;closed source&quot;
development is that &quot;there is no bottom to the rabbit hole&quot;! You can change
anything and run the most unstable &quot;bleeding edge&quot; software imaginable.

Commercial (&quot;closed source&quot;) software does not get released until much later
in the design cycle. If OpenSim were &quot;closed source&quot; then likely V0.6.7
would be &quot;production&quot; and V 0.6.8 would be &quot;beta&quot; - if indeed ANY of it was
allowed outside the factory!

Essentially the difference is that you get to make the choice and live with
the results!

If you are prepared for things a lot more subtle than the April 1 pranks to
go wrong then running the &quot;head&quot; revision helps the developers by testing
the software in a realistic environment using &quot;standard idiots&quot; as uisers.

If you are trying to build a virtual world and want to concentrate on
getting stuff built and working &quot;in world&quot; then you should be using one of
the release versions!

Just because the nightly builds or &quot;head&quot; version doesn't break often does *
not* mean that they won't break!

The April 1 antics should serve as a reminder of this!
