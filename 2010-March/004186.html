 I have worked with these animations , they seem good on the surface , but
once you get into them , you will find that many don't have a use in the
opensim context .   There are much better sources of animations for this
environment than the carnegie mellon ones .. You have to actually edit them
down to size a lot of times too and that can be hectic and many times , dont
look just right when you do it .   Animations are one of the hardest things
to get your hands on in this environment and animators are like gold here
but I have found that this source is limited in its usefulness since there
are easier ways to get better animations that fit this enviroment .

I dont want to dissuade anyone from what appears to be a great source for a
massive amount of animations ,  I am only saying that I have personally
found that there are better ways to obtain Opensim animations for your grid
.  They look good at first , but you will soon see once you get into them
that they are not a perfect fit for our use
