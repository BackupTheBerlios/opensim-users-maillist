<PRE>This is a learning process for all of us!

Hopefully a relatively fun way to learn though :-)

</I>&gt;<i> The point is that if you run &quot;development&quot; software for &quot;production&quot; you
</I>&gt;<i> WILL have problems!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One of the subtle differences between OpenSource development &quot;closed
</I>&gt;<i> source&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> development is that &quot;there is no bottom to the rabbit hole&quot;! You can change
</I>&gt;<i> anything and run the most unstable &quot;bleeding edge&quot; software imaginable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Commercial (&quot;closed source&quot;) software does not get released until much
</I>&gt;<i> later
</I>&gt;<i> in the design cycle. If OpenSim were &quot;closed source&quot; then likely V0.6.7
</I>&gt;<i> would be &quot;production&quot; and V 0.6.8 would be &quot;beta&quot; - if indeed ANY of it was
</I>&gt;<i> allowed outside the factory!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Essentially the difference is that you get to make the choice and live with
</I>&gt;<i> the results!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you are prepared for things a lot more subtle than the April 1 pranks to
</I>&gt;<i> go wrong then running the &quot;head&quot; revision helps the developers by testing
</I>&gt;<i> the software in a realistic environment using &quot;standard idiots&quot; as uisers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you are trying to build a virtual world and want to concentrate on
</I>&gt;<i> getting stuff built and working &quot;in world&quot; then you should be using one of
</I>&gt;<i> the release versions!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Just because the nightly builds or &quot;head&quot; version doesn't break often does
</I>&gt;<i> *
</I>&gt;<i> not* mean that they won't break!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The April 1 antics should serve as a reminder of this!

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yah i remeber last year, got alot of ppl mad too. The problem wasent so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mutch
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; about the prank it was not knowing one would be played. Hopefully at
</I>&gt;<i> least
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this time grid ops are better informed than last time.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So in that way i have to say ty for the reminder.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Stick ppl was funny just happened in an un-expected time and way.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It was quickly un-done and as said allready check mantis on that day as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; they
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; usualy allready have away to counter it if needed.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As far as If its right or wrong to do it. Ill avoid that topic lol.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> Well for me last year was a matter of not knowing what was beeing reffered
</I>&gt;<i> too.
</I>&gt;<i> It was at the same time as real virus threat was bbeing warrned about and
</I>&gt;<i> me
</I>&gt;<i> not knowing exactly what it was. Thought that thay were talking about a
</I>&gt;<i> trick on OSG users or a joke just between devs ect..
</I>&gt;<i> I never considered it would be done in the master svn code.
</I>&gt;<i> When i saw that something was wrong, It became a series of things as i
</I>&gt;<i> dident know and made the worst assumption and that my system had been
</I>&gt;<i> hacked
</I>&gt;<i> and nothing todo with the build.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, For me it came down to just not knowing what was beeing reffered
</I>&gt;<i> too.
</I>&gt;<i> I really dident care about the prank its selph. At the same time there were
</I>&gt;<i> some that seemed to be using it as an excuse to make alot of trouble. Im
</I>&gt;<i> shure theres some that remeber that too.
</I>&gt;<i> New ppl may be getting the wrong impression and dont know what scars there
</I>&gt;<i> were from then.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In hindsight (now that i know) its not a big deal and is done to have fun.
</I>&gt;<i> It doset make it into tagged rev. it dosent harm data or have some black
</I>&gt;<i> hidden stuff in it. Its just a joke and lives for one day in a dev. git
</I>&gt;<i> build is all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The sky is not falling :)  Have some fun if its done at all this year.
