If my thinking is correct, its not evan about what the data contains. If
someone has copyed the data from another computer with out permision of the
systems owner to do so, Thats just stealing no matter how yah slice it.
A user would have abused the system in someway to do it. requiring for
thought on there part. 
The system owner has responcabuiltys to the user is someways as a matter of
trust and its in there best intrest to take all resionable efforts to
protect it. A user the sec thay make something in away has given that data
to the owner of the system. The system owner has the actual product and is
the only one that can truly prove if data has been taken with out permision
and can show what the data was. Thay have possion of it.
So really 'who made the toilet' dosent really matter in this context. If sl
(system owner) has not given you permision to xport its data, and do it
anyway. You have just stolen it! Hacked there computers and copyed data
reguardlless of the datas content. The words theft by wire come to mind.
Im shure theres alot of laws SL could use agaisnt someone along thoughs
lines i feel thay are well with in there rights to do so.
I know nothing of law and dont claim to but to me it stands to reasion.
