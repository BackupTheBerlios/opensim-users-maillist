<PRE>Hi there,

Over the last month or so I've been working on a feature to allow entire 
regions to be saved and loaded to a single file.  This is similar to 
load-xml2/save-xml2 except that all the necessary assets to fully 
recreate the prims are also saved (textures, prim inventory items, etc). 
  The terrain of the region is also saved and restored.

This is done using the commands save-oar/load-oar at the region console, 
in a very similar manner to the user of save-xml2/load-xml2.

This is not intended to replace something like Second Inventory (since 
the commands currently require region console access).  But I thought it 
would be useful to be able to transport around everything needed to 
recreate an entire region instead of just the prim xml.  This could be 
used for passing OpenSim 'applications' around where an application is a 
particular set of objects/scripts in a region.

More details are at <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/OpenSim_Archives">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/OpenSim_Archives</A>

This feature should be considered highly experimental, since I've only 
tried it on a handful of personal machines and with rather limited 
subsets of data.  There are also known bugs which needed to be resolved. 
   Essentially, this is the stage of ironing out really basic bugs and 
missing capabilities which exist because I'm the only person who has 
ever used the feature :-)  If anybody wants to try it out I would very 
much appreciate feedback in mantis entries (or elsewhere!).

In the future I may well look at extending this functionality to save 
individual objects/parts of regions (which would mean not replacing 
everything already existing on reload), possibly saving multiple regions 
in one file (to save having to save/reload each region individually) and 
loading/saving items directly to and from inventory (which still 
wouldn't compete with SI since you need region adminstrative access to 
do it).

Regards,
