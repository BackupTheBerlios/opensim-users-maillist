<PRE>A few updates, from the forums at OpenLifeGrid (to allow for 
Opensim.ini upgrade.). and very helpful notes from the coal face from 
Terry.. thanks...

----------------------------
Upgrading Opensim

Never Delete your old Simulator until you are happy with your new one.

** DO THIS BEFORE RUNNING THE NEW VERSION FOR THE FIRST TIME !! **

1. Extract the Opensim Zip to a new location

2. From you old location copy:

    estate_settings.xml
    regionassets.yap (if present)
    AssetStorage.db
    InventoryStore.db
    OpenSim.db
    userprofiles.db
    \Regions\*

    to your new location.

3. The NEW Opensim.ini should be used as a basis (in case new element 
are added) and your own changed entries edited in.

4. If you have made a custom terrain you may want to consider 
exporting the terrain for each region before update just in case.

    change-region &lt;name&gt;
    terrain save yourfilename.f32

    These can be loaded again by putting it in the base/root folder 
and using the commands
    change-region &lt;name&gt;
    terrain load yourfilename.f32


From: &quot;Terry F.&quot; &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-users">terry at usfastweb.com</A>&gt;

I run MySQL as the database on it's own server and have my user and 
grid servers on another, and then Asset, Inventory, and Messenging 
server on another, then various simulator servers running on multiple 
servers with different configurations. I'm running 71 regions 
currently with about 120 users.

The way I update it is this:

1. Make a backup of your database
2. Make a backup of your &quot;Currently Running&quot; build(s)
3. Copy/Paste the &quot;NEW&quot; bin file to the old folder, overwriting all. 
(This will ensure you still have the &quot;OLD&quot; assets)
4. Check to be sure nothing &quot;NEW&quot; was snuck into the OpenSim.ini and 
make sure all the settings are correct.
5. delete the addin-db-000 and addins folder
6. Start it up
7. If anything goes wrong... restore you backups until you figure out 
your problem
