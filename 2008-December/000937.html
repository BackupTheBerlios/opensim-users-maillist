<PRE>Hang on. We are getting afield a bit. There are several goals and tests going on in OSGrid that have nothing to do with HyperGrid.

One of these is developing a mainland, which by its nature needs sims side by side.Another is testing region crossings at sides and corners, which also by its nature needs sims side by side.

I admire and respect Diva's work, but lets also not loose sight of the other considerations that led to us creating a grid in the first place.

Those who wish to work on HyperGrid notions may certainly put their regions away from the growing mainland at 10000,10000. I believe that the area less then 4096, 4096 may be more suitable for HyperGrid notions as it bypasses the &quot;4096 arithmetic problem&quot; in the client.

In principle, a grid server that has been upgraded could, on restart, kick off regions that have an interface number 
that is now too low.  This would be for a grid administrator that wants to ensure a smooth inter-region experience on 
the grid.

In practice, a grid administrator might want to be more lenient (perhaps notification rather than kick).

I guess you could have a grid that allows different clusters of regions where those regions use a different/old 
interface than other region clusters on the grid, yet all clusters used the same grid comms.  The problem of teleport 
(in which you still travel between disconnected clusters) might require a different interface version than an interface 
for neighbouring sims.

Nonetheless, in practice people who don't read these lists will continue to put sims side by side.  If the version 
number isn't bumped we may well see an upsurge in questions and confusion which we saw not long ago when OpenSim 
revisions crossed interface incompatibility thresholds (whether grid &lt;-&gt; sim or sim &lt;-&gt; sim).

Perhaps this is something that grid admins can give input on.  Do you think the interface version number should be 
bumped with neighbour interface changes to stop people having problems when they are neighbouring regions with 
incompatible versions?  Or should people always be instructed to keep regions away from each other unless they are sure 
that their neighbours are going to update in sync with themselves.
