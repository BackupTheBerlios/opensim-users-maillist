<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>Giving another avatar permission to &quot;edit, delete or take objects&quot; in
the friends list seems to have no effect when I do this for my
partner, and does not even persist, yet I can change her stuff without
her having to do that for me (she has the same problems with
persistence).  Naturally, this severely impedes our ability to work
together on projects, which we'd very much like to do; indeed, this
was one of our primary reasons for adopting OSGrid.

Has anyone else had experience in this area?  If it's not been
implemented yet, is there some way of working round it?

I'm hosting the regions, (Ubuntu 8.10/MySQL), and using OSG's UGAIM
servers.  In an attempt to work round this problem, I created a parcel
for the entirety of one region and &quot;sold&quot; it to my partner for $0, but
this made the server crash whenever she entered the region and I had
to roll back.  What could have gone wrong there?

Many thanks for any help.

</PRE>
