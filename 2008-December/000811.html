<PRE>Excellent Post Anton! :D

Very informative.

Cheers

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am afraid that I am unfamiliar with it. What I can say that when
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; making a new viewer with our resources, there is no opportunity to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; explore with protocols. We will focus on reX as a module on OpenSim
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have some experience from using Verse (we tested it for movie production
</I>&gt;<i> as a part of project orange.blender.org when made the elephantsdream.org),
</I>&gt;<i> and also discussed it with some people who were involved with openviewer
</I>&gt;<i> last spring (&lt;daedius&gt; if i recall correctly), so try to summary my
</I>&gt;<i> understanding here as it was brought up.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Verse protocol is primarily not for making virtual worlds, nor
</I>&gt;<i> games, but for connecting different apps like 3d modellers and
</I>&gt;<i> paint programs etc. to be able to collaborate and/or see results
</I>&gt;<i> live. I think the power there is being able to sync things like change of
</I>&gt;<i> a position of a vertex in a mesh, or the colour of a pixel in a texture
</I>&gt;<i> bitmap, so that you can e.g. have a modeller, paint app, and a game engine
</I>&gt;<i> running as Verse apps with the shared data on the server. This would save
</I>&gt;<i> from the typical export-import-restart loop, and allows tweaking models,
</I>&gt;<i> uv coordinates and textures so that you see the actual result in the game
</I>&gt;<i> engine / movie renderer immediately.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It may still be interesting to think of it in the opensim/rex context.
</I>&gt;<i> Daedius had an interesting idea to integrate verse to the viewer, so that
</I>&gt;<i> changes made in e.g. a modelling app would show immediately in the meshes,
</I>&gt;<i> and then after editing the client would upload the version of mesh to the
</I>&gt;<i> server.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another route we were once thinking was to add Verse support to the
</I>&gt;<i> Opensim/Rex server, so that Verse enabled apps could connect to it for
</I>&gt;<i> authoring (e.g. manipulating the scene, moving obs/prims etc with a more
</I>&gt;<i> powerful interface - i'd sure like to have outliner, multiple viewports
</I>&gt;<i> etc when editing scenes). I don't know which would be easier and better:
</I>&gt;<i> add SL protocol support for a modelling app so it could work as an
</I>&gt;<i> authoring client, or add Verse support to the OpenSim server.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The situation with Verse in general remains tricky as far as I know -
</I>&gt;<i> during the Uni-Verse project they added preliminary support to Blender (by
</I>&gt;<i> integrating it in the insides) and to Max (as a plugin), and tried with
</I>&gt;<i> Maya, and made a plugin for Gimp. One lesson they learned was that adding
</I>&gt;<i> good verse support, especially to a closed source app, is hard as classic
</I>&gt;<i> apps are typically not structured so that network access could touch their
</I>&gt;<i> dearest data. When making a new app with Verse in mind it's all different
</I>&gt;<i> and Eskil has been succesful there with his own toolset. But basically
</I>&gt;<i> Verse seems pretty much dead to me, no one using, no one adding support.
</I>&gt;<i> It's still the only thing I know for such a purpose and seems to work well
</I>&gt;<i> (it synchs vertex movements quickly), and the callback design is perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> good too, so dunno if it'll somehow pick up some day anyway.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also I don't know where the differences in the actual protocol lie in the
</I>&gt;<i> end - Verse focuses on syncing 2d and 3d data needed for making movies and
</I>&gt;<i> games, meshes, uv coords, textures, shader params, .., and does not touch
</I>&gt;<i> things like avatar animations and even less IM, commerce or anything like
</I>&gt;<i> that which you have in SL. But still e.g. the object movents are similar
</I>&gt;<i> functionality, and the Verse protocol is extensible for custom data, so
</I>&gt;<i> don't know if it could fit despite the different initial focus. I do
</I>&gt;<i> recall that Eskil himself didn't use it for his MMO, so am still guessing
</I>&gt;<i> that it fits just the authoring better.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are other projects with protocols for virtual worlds with focus more
</I>&gt;<i> similar to OpenSim/Rex, like <A HREF="http://interreality.org">http://interreality.org</A> and of course Croquet
</I>&gt;<i> etc. so for SL replacements / alternatives those would probably be more
</I>&gt;<i> relevant to consider. Verse might be an interesting complementing tool in
</I>&gt;<i> the set. But like Ryan said, Rex targets now at getting a viewer that'll
</I>&gt;<i> work with the current server using the existing protocol. Anyone else,
</I>&gt;<i> feel free to experiment with Verse and stuff!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ~Toni, not speaking for the Rex project but to inform them too :)
