Very good point!

Maybe it should be renamed to &quot;new patch&quot; instead of &quot;feature request&quot; =)

However, there is a bit of politics not seen for the ability to move 
objects from in-world to another application or another virtual world. 
There are those that won't openly admit it that such feature to exchange 
objects for collaboration is against their business model. It's a 
political issue for them keep all the eggs in their nest, even if it is 
someone else's eggs, as they profit when that &quot;somone else&quot; pays for 
their nest.

People spent a lot of their own volunteer time (even paid time) to 
create original work (eggs). When you find out you can't get your eggs 
out of their nest, well... that's the way it has been.

So, I don't think it'll be renamed from &quot;feature request&quot; into &quot;new 
patch,&quot; because new feature requests are a good source of new ideas. 
However, Collada (or object importers/exporters) aren't a new idea, but 
it's the idea itself that gets steamrolled by those that profit more 
when less (or limited) external collaboration tools exists.

Enjoy
