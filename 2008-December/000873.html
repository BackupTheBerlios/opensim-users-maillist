We aren't talking here about replacing the the network protocol that now 
exists in the the sims with Verse.

</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
All that can be placed in the collada file, which is XML. What matters 
is that the DOM interface recognizes the data. The collada teams has 
sorted out popular formats into the format, and we can add more data 
types, like group information and permissions. You aren't limited by 
what the collada team has only sorted. Yes, it can all be put into the 
collada file.



&gt;<i> Aren't people already using the save-oar &amp; load-oar  tools for this .. 
</I>&gt;<i> oh that seems to be for full regions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyhow right now we are closer to having such files to save &amp; distribute 
</I>&gt;<i> with the OpenSim specific xml serializing. I know Mikko Pallari in the 
</I>&gt;<i> Realxtend project (I'm now doing work for them too) was working on a new 
</I>&gt;<i> version of a serializer last week, with Adam Frisby - 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Xml_Objects_Format">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Xml_Objects_Format</A> is the format sketch we 
</I>&gt;<i> looked at when starting the work .. Mikko showed some code last week put 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know yet where he put it before leaving for holidays (am just 
</I>&gt;<i> catching up after the weekend myself..)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The goal in that new serializer work is to have the serialization 
</I>&gt;<i> independent of changes in the SOG/SOP code (i.e. how the prim/object 
</I>&gt;<i> groups and parts are in the internals), so that the format would not 
</I>&gt;<i> change with new versions of OpenSim.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As you see in that older draft already, many things in SL are totally 
</I>&gt;<i> different from Collada - in a Collada doc you don't see RootPosition and 
</I>&gt;<i> Parts, nor Shape with a Circle face and Straight Extrusion etc.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Parametric prim data can be placed in a collada file as well.

&gt;<i> Might be still interesting to look at how things are in Collada, and how 
</I>&gt;<i> those Collada processors you mention work etc., but I don't see how 
</I>&gt;<i> Collada could work for storing SL like assets.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Verse might be able, as it is based on the notion of 'perfect data', 
</I>&gt;<i> like prims: a sphere is a sphere (though in Verse everything is somehow 
</I>&gt;<i> also a subdiv surface iirc? don't know how the details are.). And Sony 
</I>&gt;<i> paid Eskil a couple of years ago to write Collada support for Verse 
</I>&gt;<i> (import / export), as they started thinking it is perhaps the next good 
</I>&gt;<i> things after Collada, but that I guess is another story ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And of course in Realxtend where we support meshes too Collada is more 
</I>&gt;<i> relevant, was also discussed a while ago in 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://groups.google.com/group/realxtend/browse_thread/thread/3c56de585b71cf91">http://groups.google.com/group/realxtend/browse_thread/thread/3c56de585b71cf91</A> 
</I>&gt;<i> (the situation basically is that Rex currently supports just the ogre 
</I>&gt;<i> format - something more interoperable would be nice but no one is 
</I>&gt;<i> developing that now). But also there we'd still need something that 
</I>&gt;<i> support prims too, and like said that's right now going to be the new 
</I>&gt;<i> version of the existing OpenSim xml serialization.

Collada is designed to be an intermediate language. What CIL in 
.NET/Mono is to various languages, like C/C++/C#/J/Java/etc, is 
analogous to what Collada in 3D graphics is to various 3D applications, 
3DS/SL Viewer/OpenGL/and everyone else listed here: 
<A HREF="https://collada.org/mediawiki/index.php/Portal:Products_directory">https://collada.org/mediawiki/index.php/Portal:Products_directory</A>

When the optimized, xml-serialization format is determined, then it 
would be good time to see how to rearrange that again into collada format.
