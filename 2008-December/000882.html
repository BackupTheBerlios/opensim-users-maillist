&gt;<i> Most likely such data will go into the &lt;extra&gt; tags until they can be 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;refined&quot; and fit into the schema that exists.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
Fair enough.

&gt;<i> Here is an ideology, for example:
</I>&gt;<i> * Start Rex
</I>&gt;<i> * Select a few objects to export
</I>&gt;<i> * Rex saves objects into its own custom XML file (as you described)
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
Actually that description was for OpenSim in general, and specifically 
for SL like data i.e. prims. I figure for the Rex extension it will 
first just point to the Ogre mesh file (for which there is also an XML 
serialization btw, but that's beside the point).

&gt;<i> * Process those XML files with the collada processor
</I>&gt;<i> * collada processor compiles data from the XML files and even interacts 
</I>&gt;<i> with opensim/viewer to compile/refine needed information
</I>&gt;<i> * collada processor outputs a DAE file
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
interesting, for example that part on the processor interacting with 
e.g. opensim code perhaps. indeed opensim aims at being an api so might 
fit nicely that it could serve other data handlers too, to provide 
object data etc.

but this DAE file..

&gt;<i> Further:
</I>&gt;<i> * Load DAE file into Blender
</I>&gt;<i> * Modify objects
</I>&gt;<i> * Save changes
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
Is this supposing a custom OpenSim/SL version of the format used for the 
DAE, or did the processor already convert the parametric models 
('prims') to something that the existing importer &amp; exporter would 
support? I guess not, and that you are assuming custom support for e.g. 
the Blender tools. Which would be perfectly ok of course, support for 
this can't come from out of nowhere anyway, the effort must be done 
somewhere.
&gt;<i> found on the collada website (i.e. Sony's Refinery). The given processor 
</I>&gt;<i> would need to be extended to support and resolve objects with opensim.
</I>&gt;<i> The concern from the mantis issue is that the processor extensions would 
</I>&gt;<i> need to be developed
</I>
Sure. But like said in any case some custom XML code is needed for 
OpenSim in any case. Now has been written as fit for the project, but 
sounds like it might be worth considering if it could somehow fit in the 
larger Collada (or some other) frame.
