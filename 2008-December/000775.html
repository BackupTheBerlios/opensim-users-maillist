<PRE>The problem with SQLite is that it's very very slow by comparison.

There's a real noticeable difference between the speed it takes to perform operations, and that of say MySQL.

It's also a little bit easier to corrupt - for instance you can't have two processes accessing the one sqlite DB at once.

Subject: Re: [Opensim-users] opensim migration strategy

This is a bit of a soap box, so if your are easily offended or annoyed, just pass by, there is nothing to see here.

I see in the OpenSim world the assertion that SQLite is not production worthy often. Most recently here:

<A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Upgrading">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Upgrading</A>
SQLite (default - a lightweight database that comes bundled with OpenSim and can be used without requiring any extra configuration. It is mostly intended to get you up and running quickly, not for production use.)

I prefer to describe SQLite as:
SQLite is a software library that implements a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine. SQLite is the most widely deployed SQL database engine in the world. The source code for SQLite is in the public domain.

These companies believe SQLite is production worthy/ready: <A HREF="http://www.sqlite.org/famous.html">http://www.sqlite.org/famous.html</A>

I am a huge fan of SQLite, and for what it does, I believe it does it very well.

Thanks for letting me get that out, and I hope I can influence more of you to take a better look at SQLite.
