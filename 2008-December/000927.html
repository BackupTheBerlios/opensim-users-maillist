<PRE>My message about the consequences of vicinity was more towards people 
who have regions in OSGrid, really, although the situation is generic.
As we work on inter-sim comms, things will get wild for people having 
neighbors in OSGrid which they don't control.
It's cool if people want to help find the problems and fix them; it's 
not cool if people want stability. For stability, get away from regions 
which you don't control.

As a heads up, r7891 and above breaks inter-sim communications with 
older versions.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As we move opensim into a truly decentralized system, with things like
</I>&gt;<i> the Hypergrid, but also grids like OSGrid, it is important for people
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> understand what space vicinity really means, and the consequences of
</I>&gt;<i> neighboring someone. I thought I'd write this in an email, to reach
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> wider number of opensim users.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One of the main features of these 3D VWs is the continuity of 3D space
</I>&gt;<i> in a logical grid. That is, you are in a region but you can see the
</I>&gt;<i> things that are in neighboring regions, even when those neighboring
</I>&gt;<i> regions are running on machines half-way across the globe. You can
</I>&gt;<i> cross
</I>&gt;<i> to your remote neighbors as if you were crossing to a region on your
</I>&gt;<i> machine, etc. That's all very nice, but...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This model is taken from massive multi-player on-line games *that are
</I>&gt;<i> controlled by single organizations*. Things need a lot more
</I>&gt;<i> consideration when we go to a decentralized control system. Let me
</I>&gt;<i> explain why.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The illusion of space continuity is achieved by spawning computations
</I>&gt;<i> on
</I>&gt;<i> your neighbors' machines (and your neighbors' on yours). This is done
</I>&gt;<i> via inter-simulator communications, that start and manage what is
</I>&gt;<i> known
</I>&gt;<i> as &quot;child agents&quot;. There are a number of consequences of this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) As we work on inter-simulator communications, if your neighbors
</I>&gt;<i> aren't exactly on the same version of OpenSim that you are, things may
</I>&gt;<i> break badly for you.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) For HG, if you place an hyperlink next to your region, it will
</I>&gt;<i> create
</I>&gt;<i> child agents on that remote simulator. For example, if everybody would
</I>&gt;<i> place the UCI Welcome region as a direct neighbor, the poor UCI
</I>&gt;<i> Welcome
</I>&gt;<i> region would have hundreds of child agents -- the number of
</I>&gt;<i> hyper-neighbors is not restricted to 8.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For the HG, distance is not enforced (yet), but it may very well be
</I>&gt;<i> enforced soon.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For grids like OSGrid, I strongly advise people who want some form of
</I>&gt;<i> stability while using SVN Head (ah!) to keep distance from their
</I>&gt;<i> neighbors. Inter-sim comms are about to go through a period of change.
