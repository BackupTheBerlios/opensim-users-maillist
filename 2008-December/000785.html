<PRE>To address just a tiny portion of this -
if a script is on a server, then the server admin can get it, it's worth operating any business assumptions you have with that principle in mind.

There's nothing you can do even theoretically to disallow this from happening (CIL can be reversed back into C# fairly easily - Reflector for instance can do it accurately). The only ways to prevent that from happening is to prevent the script from being copied onto that server - one such way of doing this might be to run the script remotely. (ala a 'hosted' model)

Regards,

Adam

Subject: [Opensim-users] Permissions

Dearl all,


Earlier Stefan did start with a Permission page on the wiki:



<A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/OpenSim:Permissions%28Server%29">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/OpenSim:Permissions%28Server%29</A>



and today I run in a situation where I just wanted to know &quot;why&quot; that happened.  I know, that the permissions will not copy SL 1:1, but it was somehow strange to me and I couldn&#180;t figure it out by using Stefans page.



I went out to a place where someone was working on a youtoube player. He did post his code earlier, but did decide for the time work goes on to put the playlist and script no mod/no trans - but the whole player way a &quot;anyone copy&quot; object.  I did take a copy.



I did reez it on one of my regions.



And now I have full rights.



I guess by Stefans wikipage, that is because i&#180;m an Administrator at my regions ?



So, how are the rights to other people ?





And want that be a big showstopper for commercial plans ?   only strictly commercial regions, where is one company holding the Admin account (you have to trust them, but nothing new) will avoid this problem.





Cheers

Ralf
