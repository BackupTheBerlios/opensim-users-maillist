I would say the right way is to 
 
1) create a sim-sim versioning scheme, so sims can refuse/negotiate comms on version numbering
 
and
 
2) Include an optional filtering in the grid service on version numbers - so that grids simply does not report neighbours with wrong sim-sim version scheme; which lets regions construct trusted and versioned maps transparently.
We did something like #2 on tribal net to accomodate for the fast up/fast down scheme that is an integral part of it - offline or timed out regions were filtered out separately from being removed from database, to let regions disappear for a couple of hours without losing their 'spot'.

This is about sim-sim comms, &gt; &gt; not sim-grid comms. Therefore if you havion n ue a running sim connected to &gt; &gt; osgrid who's owner is on vacation, that sim will continue to run -- and &gt; &gt; maybe cause problems to the neighbors -- even if you bump up the version &gt; &gt; number in Servers. We would need to check the version number on &gt; &gt; inter-region comms, not just on region registration with the grid. Or &gt; &gt; else on region registration, the grid server should look into the &gt; &gt; VersionNumber of the potential neighbors and warn/disallow registrations &gt; &gt; when the version numbers are not compatible.&gt; &gt; In principle, a grid server that has been upgraded could, on restart, kick off regions that have an interface number &gt; that is now too low. This would be for a grid administrator that wants to ensure a smooth inter-region experience on &gt; the grid.&gt; &gt; In practice, a grid administrator might want to be more lenient (perhaps notification rather than kick).&gt; &gt; I guess you could have a grid that allows different clusters of regions where those regions use a different/old &gt; interface than other region clusters on the grid, yet all clusters used the same grid comms. The problem of teleport &gt; (in which you still travel between disconnected clusters) might require a different interface version than an interface &gt; for neighbouring sims.&gt; &gt; Nonetheless, in practice people who don't read these lists will continue to put sims side by side. If the version &gt; number isn't bumped we may well see an upsurge in questions and confusion which we saw not long ago when OpenSim &gt; revisions crossed interface incompatibility thresholds (whether grid &lt;-&gt; sim or sim &lt;-&gt; sim).&gt; &gt; Perhaps this is something that grid admins can give input on. Do you think the interface version number should be &gt; bumped with neighbour interface changes to stop people having problems when they are neighbouring regions with &gt; incompatible versions? Or should people always be instructed to keep regions away from each other unless they are sure &gt; that their neighbours are going to update in sync with themselves.&gt; &gt; -- &gt; justincc&gt; Justin Clark-Casey&gt; <A HREF="http://justincc.wordpress.com">http://justincc.wordpress.com</A>&gt; _______________________________________________&gt; Opensim-users mailing list&gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-users">Opensim-users at lists.berlios.de</A>&gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-users">https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-users</A>
