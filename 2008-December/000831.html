<PRE>
Because of several reasons, I had to re-install my Ubuntu 8.041 and just tried running my mono-build.sh from <A HREF="http://xyzzyxyzzy.net/2008/05/08/updated-mono-build-script-for-hardy-heron-and-mono-191/">http://xyzzyxyzzy.net/2008/05/08/updated-mono-build-script-for-hardy-heron-and-mono-191/</A>

But running it, it failed a few times in the fetching the packages. I had updated my whole Ubuntu prior to that. Seams either the available packages have changed or are no longer available.

Is there an updated version of that script ?

Here is my mono-build.sh output :

sudo ./mono-test.sh
