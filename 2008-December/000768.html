<PRE>
Kyle,
 
&gt;<i> I'm going to claim utter and absolute&gt; selfishness here and state that I cannot see any situation under which&gt; I would have only 1 location open in the 3D web.
</I> 
But others can and do - especially the out-of-the-box noob or the app dev just wanting to throw up a region to test a module.
 
&gt;<i> For the purpose of &quot;easily getting things set up&quot;, standalone is all&gt; but useless in its initial state. It's certainly easier to get set&gt; up, but it's also much more limited.
</I>It has one glorious use : letting people get an instant taste of OpenSim. That's probably what got us this far this fast.
 &gt; Grid mode is perhaps a bit more difficult to set up -- but the default&gt; in the configuration file is for the Null storage plugin to be used&gt; under standalone mode. This makes things... difficult... when trying&gt; to explain how to get modifications to the environment saved. 
 
For region persistence, it's SQLite, not Null?
 
&gt;<i> Because&gt; first, you have to explain how to configure the storage for the other&gt; modules (again, for standalone). 
</I> 
I must admit I'm a bit confused as of what resources you mean need configuration and extra set-up. Can you be more specific?
 
&gt;<i> Also, I've been following the posts on the topic of the HyperGrid. I&gt; need more information on this: will it work for any of the minigrids&gt; to be in standalone mode when they try to connect with the HG? My gut&gt; feeling says no... and my reason for promoting grid over standalone is&gt; simply this: the HyperGrid is much closer to what the web is --&gt; multiple administrative domains that all work together to pass traffic&gt; between them. I don't view HG as being the final evolution, but I do&gt; view it as being a very good start.
</I>Definitively - HG is a major step along the very lines we've been envisioning since the very beginning - when we first started using the phrase &quot;3D Web&quot;. Let's not forget the &quot;friendly teleports&quot; region handle hacks of old. This is all building one step at a time, towards a golden future. The project has come a long way in only two years.
 
And I'm pretty confident that there's even more magical stuff brewing on private hard drives and in corporate offices. :D
 &gt; (And thank you, as always, for your time. :))
And thank you for yours, Kyle!
/Stefan
