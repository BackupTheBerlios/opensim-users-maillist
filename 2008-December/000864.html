Hi John,

 

not yet implemented..

 

but &#150; a nice workarround should be to have those collaborating  as estate
manager.  NOT admin (will work in one direction only).

 

If one is holding the estate, use the Linden way:  put a &#147;Governor&#148; in for
holding the estate, make all the relevant user a estate manager.

 

 

The implementation of the edit rights is somehow belonging to groups.

 

cu 

Ralf

Giving another avatar permission to &quot;edit, delete or take objects&quot; in

the friends list seems to have no effect when I do this for my

partner, and does not even persist, yet I can change her stuff without

her having to do that for me (she has the same problems with

persistence).  Naturally, this severely impedes our ability to work

together on projects, which we'd very much like to do; indeed, this

was one of our primary reasons for adopting OSGrid.

 

Has anyone else had experience in this area?  If it's not been

implemented yet, is there some way of working round it?

 

I'm hosting the regions, (Ubuntu 8.10/MySQL), and using OSG's UGAIM

servers.  In an attempt to work round this problem, I created a parcel

for the entirety of one region and &quot;sold&quot; it to my partner for $0, but

this made the server crash whenever she entered the region and I had

to roll back.  What could have gone wrong there?

 

Many thanks for any help.
