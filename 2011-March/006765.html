</I>I have another one along these lines, I can't seem to use viewer 2.0+ 
and keep my attachments in place because opensim don't use something 
called attachment staking, without ruining my clothing attachments, so I 
have to stick with Hippo.  Plus, I was only recently told after trying 
for way to long to use Freeswitch, only to be told that I must set up 
freeswitch using IP numbers, because it won't work using an IP DNS 
server like DYNDNS for an external IP.  I can't afford a business 
account at my ISP, so my IP is dynamic.  I am also behind a firewall, 
but have acces to opening my ports..

So, now you are telling me with your list, that I can't use one of my 
last choises to add voice to my grid, because I can't have a firewall at 
all with Vivox?  Do I have any other choises to add voice that I can 
look up and try to get running?

It just seems as I go along, I get more disapointed.
I hope there is a little light at the end of this tunnel.
Help is so very appreciated.

InuYasha..
