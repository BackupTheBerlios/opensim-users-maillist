<PRE>I know there is lots of info out there on Freeswitch.  I read and read 
until 2:30am this morning and eventually because a little confused as to 
what is available and what I really need for my particular setup.

1. Some of this might sound a bit ignorant to you, but I am ignorant on 
the subject of VOIP, and I am not comfotable enough with C# codeing to 
compile myself.  I use Windows 7 64-bit, on a quad core machine to run a 
opensim version 7.0.2 and other then known issues, it seems to be 
running as expected.   I would like to add Freswitch voice to it so I 
can speak to my firned while building.  I have a few questions that have 
me confused after reading throgh so much info.

1.  Would Freswitch be the VoIP server, or to get it to work do I need 
VoIP supplied by my ISP?

2. I read something about only a certain version will work with the new 
7.0.2 OpenSim, which version do I need, and can I get the 64 bit version 
precompiled.

3.  If I can get a pre-compiled version, does it come with an installer.

4. I have seen a version in a message from early 2010 that let me 
download Freeswitch version 1.0.4, still not sure if it is the version I 
need.  It shows an example of the installation screen, and it has a list 
of checkboxes.  What parts do I need for opensim to use voice?  I hate 
to use more drive space on other installations, because I am saving my 
terrabyte drive for MySQL asset data.

Thanks to all and anyone who can help answer some or all these questions.
InuYasha
