Actual spike value varies with sim load, but pattern is the same regardless of load. Parameter is &quot;SaveInterval&quot; in XEngine params in OpenSim.ini. Default interval is 120 seconds. Changed SaveInterval to other time values to test and sure enough, spike occurs at those intervals.

Out of interest, how many scripts are we talking about here?  Are they complicated scripts with a lot of state?

As far as I can see, script state saving is single threaded.

Hi Justin- sorry for the delay in reply. There is about 160-odd scripts per region. Close to half of them are what I'd call somewhat complicated in terms of use of state- those ones are particularly focused on transaction processing, i.e., each region consists of shops (or stores) that provide various goods and services and the system to support this is scripted into objects, some of which avatars use to &quot;produce&quot; (from a defined set of resources), price/re-price and sell products/services for their store as well as buying products/services from other stores. Using &quot;top&quot; in Ubuntu, when the XEngine automatic script save is invoked, the CPU% for mono briefly spikes well over 100%, but overall CPU %idle is still quite high (roughly 60-70%). It doesn't cause of itself the sim to crash- it was just something I discovered when trying to work out why mono was causing CPU spikes at what appeared to be regular intervals. So what you're implying is that it's state complexity within scripts rather than script count that may account for this? 

Cheers,
Adam
