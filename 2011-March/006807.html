<PRE>The OpenSim vendor directory is a great place to start:

<A HREF="http://www.hypergridbusiness.com/opensim-hosting-providers/">http://www.hypergridbusiness.com/opensim-hosting-providers/</A>

I would also recommend checking with Simon Gutteridge of PioneerX (also
known as James Beejay).

His company has a grid management system which creates a web front end for
your entire grid, allowing you to easily manage regions, users, even
in-world currency.

Prices start at just 25 pounds a month per region (if they host it for you)
and 25 pounds a month for the management suite. You can just get the
management stuff, and host the regions on your own servers -- the management
suite handles all the software upgrades and will even restart regions if
they crash -- it checks to see how well they're behaving every five minutes.

I'm doing an article about them now and will be posting a lot more details
at hypergridbusiness.com either today or tomorrow.

They're already running several grids, including Sim-World and Curiosity
Grid (for educators). 

Their website is here: <A HREF="http://www.pioneerx-estates.co.uk/">http://www.pioneerx-estates.co.uk/</A>
Contact Simon at: <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-users">helpdesk at pioneerx.co.uk</A> 

Other folks to try include ReactionGrid -- very well known with educators
and non-profits, SimHost -- comes very highly recommended, Dreamland
Metaverse -- they have some Web-based tools, but not as complete a suite as
PioneerX yet, and Talent Raspel.

I know that SimHost, Dreamland, and Talent Raspel do consulting as well.
ReactionGrid sells a preconfigured version of OpenSim and will install and
manage it for you.
