Well, if I ask this on a hardware/router forum they will bounce me  
back to OpenSim forums and lists and it's too specialised for the BT  
forum.


&gt;<i> On that note, I took a look at the screen shots

</I>
The example used on that page with the screen shots  didn't use the  
triggers field so I'm thinking thats not a problem as such.  There are  
hundreds of preconfigured settings on the router for all sorts of  
applications and while opensim wasn't there (my router is about four  
years old) it's hard to believe that it won't work.


&gt;<i> I do see that there's a DMZ option on your device (It's that DMZ link
</I>&gt;<i> under the .Application Sharing link on the left navigation bar).   If
</I>&gt;<i> you set your OpenSimulator computer as the computer in the DMZ
</I>&gt;<i> (DeMilitarized Zone), and make sure that your firewall is 'off', It'll
</I>&gt;<i> work
</I>
I have already tried that and it didn't work.  The port checking  
website I mentioned still said the port was closed so I'm not  
convinced about whether that page works at all.  Is there a way to  
check ports via terminal commands and are there any other settings in  
the opensim configuration that need to be set to allow the ports to  
work?

Thanks in advance
Garrett
