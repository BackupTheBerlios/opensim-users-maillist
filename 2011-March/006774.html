</I>&gt;<i>I know Freeswitch is currently a pain to set up, but I would be a 
</I>&gt;<i>little surprised if it's not working with Viewer 2 as
</I>&gt;<i>well.  Austin - have you used it with Viewer 2?
</I>
FreeSwitch voice is working fine with Viewer 1.23.5 (and it should 
work fine also with the many third party viewers based on Viewer 1 
code).  Its been working for us under 0.6.9 and 0.7.0.x and with 
melanie's revised structure with remote and local connectors under 
0.7.1.  You can try it out if you wish on OSGrid add-on regions 
Vue-3200 or Vue-6400 which we host here at the Virtual University of 
Edinburgh and which uses our single FreeSwitch server which also 
serves the main Openvue grid regions.

We have not ever been able to get FreeSwitch voice in OpenSim to work 
with Viewer 2.. though I am not sure what the issue is, unless its a 
change in the SLVoice.exe or SL Voice protocols.  Maybe Melanie can 
comment on whether that can be made to work.  It would be good if it 
was, as Viewer 2 is all we really use nowadays and its a pain to have 
to switch back to Viewer 1.23.5 just to get voice.. which we really need.

But its worse than that as the current 0.7.1 dev version of 
Freeswitch actually locks up with Viewer 2 if the default of voice 
being set to on is in use by ANY SINGLE user.  I hope this can be 
fixed (even if just by not allowing a voice connection to be tried by 
the server if Viewer 2 is in use) before a 0.7.1 release candidate. See

I have been giving InuYasha some assistance already in direct 
messages, but with regards to firewalls, you should be able to open 
the relevant ports required if you are authorized to do so by your 
network provider.

With regards to configuration... the FreeSwitch server config files 
seem to require IP NUMBERS and whren openSim gives talks with the 
server such numbers seem to want to be exchanged. So the FreeSwitch 
server settings in ithe OpenSim config file aside also seem to 
require to be  IP numbers too.  Note that  EVERYWHERE else in our 
OpenSim.ini and Robust.HG.ini files we use fully qualified externally 
accessible DNS names or aliases rather than IP numbers of local host names.

&gt;<i>Alternatively, you might want to look at Whisper if all your clients 
</I>&gt;<i>are on Windows and you don't mind replacing the
</I>&gt;<i>SLVoice.exe.

</I>
At some stage we will switch to Whsiper once it works with Viewer 2 
and hopefully with the default SLVoice.exe, as its complex for normal 
users to be told to use the SLVoice.exe swapping mechanism and it 
would put them off.. as well as likely leaving them confused when 
they switch between OpenSim and Second Life.

Its pretty easy for the viewer side really though really.  I keep a 
COPY of the viewer folder with the custom SLVoice.exe installed and 
never switch back and forth.  I just have a shortcut on my desktop to 
one or the other.
