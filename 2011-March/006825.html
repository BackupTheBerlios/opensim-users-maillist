<PRE>Thanks...one step closer...

I got the server running (had to solve another issue with gdiplus, but figured that one out)...but now I have a new problem. The server is running. I can add accounts from the server prompt. I can see those user accounts reflected in the mysql database side of things...but when I attempt to login, I get a user not found error. I found references on the opensim site about migration issues with the db, and capitalization of tables names...tried the lower_case_sensitive=1 addition to my.cnf and lo and behold, it appeared to work...sometimes...but I'm not certain I was even editing the right copy of my.cnf, but after some start and stops of both servers, I could login.

So I set about to repeat the installation on my kids' computer. I get the same login error, but this time, when I try and apply the lower_case_sensitive=1 option, that errors out and mysqld won't launch. So I dug about more and found the option: lower_case_table_names=1 which claims it will drop case on both creation and lookup of table names. This seems to be true as I restarted the process, all new database, and I end up with all lower case table names. But, still no logins. I altered the setting to lower_case_table_names=2 which says it will leave the case as entered, but make sure to translate to lower case on lookups. This also seems to work in that it creates the database with some tables with caps in the names...ie UserAccounts rather then useraccounts. But I still can't login.

Now it gets even worse...I returned to my computer to see if I had something different on my computer than what I had on the kids' computer...and now my system is in the same state,...mysql is up and running, opensim is up and running, but all login attempts end with a user not found error.

Ideas?

I'm using:
opensim 0.7.0.1
mysql 5.1.56
Mac OS 10.6.6 and Mac OS 10.6.3
mono 2.10.1_3

Thanks
Jeff

Well regarding the join estate thing , it is funny but just answer yes and when prompted for estate name reply with a nonsense it wil complain that the state does not exist and will re ask the first question , there you can safelly respond no and it will progress without error (tricky funny) but ye several bugs with mysql on that version , im using 7.0.0.1 to avoid those issues

Subject: Re: [Opensim-users] SQL error or connection string configuration
	error

I've just downloaded opensim 0.7.0.2 and mysql 5.1.56. I've set up mysql, and I can connect to the server, do things to the opensim db that I created, etc. So mysql seems happy. When I try and start up the opensim server, it runs through its set routine including lots of notes about &quot;migrating&quot;. In all that output there are a number of places where it complains that tables already exist or that it can't find a table called users (ie opensim.users) doesn't exist. It eventually gets to the prompt about joining an existing estate. When I give the default answer of No it then errors out with lots of stuff about mysql (below).

I can see in mysql that opensim is talking to the server because it has created 25 tables. So it isn't a db connection issue, but clearly there are some assumptions being made in the set up that are not valid...ie there are create table commands being issued when tables already exist, or alterations to tables that don't exist or trying to access data from a table called 'users' that doesn't exist.

I can re-run some of the table creation commands and such by manually dropping tables, then re-running the commands to re-create those tables using the output from the set up process...but in instances where it is seeking data from a table that doesn't exist, I don't know what to do. For example:

23:23:58 - [MIGRATIONS]: Cmd was Table 'opensim.users' doesn't exist in SQL: BEGIN; INSERT INTO auth (UUID, passwordHash, passwordSalt, webLoginKey) SELECT `UUID` AS UUID, `passwordHash` AS passwordHash, `passwordSalt` AS passwordSalt, `webLoginKey` AS webLoginKey FROM users; COMMIT; 

Is there a place to simply download the entire database schema needed that I can just load into mysql myself?

I'm running on my MacBook Pro 10.6.6, 3.06ghz Intel Core 2 Duo. I'm just trying to set up a standalone server so I can play around, build things, etc. and also let my kids play around in a &quot;walled garden&quot;

thanks
Jeff

Dont know if your problem really requires switching to mySQL since you say
the installation had been running but here is info on installing mySQL for
opensim.

<A HREF="https://github.com/diva/d2/wiki/MySql">https://github.com/diva/d2/wiki/MySql</A>

To do it you first need to download and install mySQL after which you use
the above instructions which will create a data container called opensim in
mySQL
Then before running opensim you change sections in the opensim.ini to tell
opensim to use mySQL rather then lite.
Then you do run opensim to do the INITIAL INSTALL which will create tables
in the database (which you already set up) and opensim will continue to
start up using these new data files. 

If you have objects in the lite datafiles i am not sure how you migrate them
to the mySQL container.
