It compiles. I don't know if it works, I was never able to make 
Freeswitch work myself. The refactoring shouldn't have changed anything 
in its functioning -- I didn't touch the optional modules.

&gt;<i> b) Is any change needed to run Wifi 0.7.1 b with 0.7.2 dev master?
</I>
If wifi-0.7.1 runs on 0.7.2-dev, it's pure coincidence! It will break 
eventually. Here's how .NET works:

Executables can have any number of dynamic linked libraries (DLLs), but 
if those DLLs' public interfaces change since the executable (and the 
other DLLs) were produced, then they can't be loaded anymore. In other 
words, if some OpenSim core DLL that Wifi depends upon changes its 
public interface, then the Wifi DLLs can't be loaded.

That's the reason why I have been putting the release number on the wifi 
package, so that there is no question about which executable and 
collection of DLLs it is compatible with.

If ppl want to use Wifi with current master head, best shot is to 
compile it against that code base. Obviously, I am not going to maintain 
binary versions of Wifi for every single commit in master branch. If 
someone cares to do it -- be my guest.

&gt;<i> While I am asking about Wifi I noted a small change to the 
</I>&gt;<i> Wifi.ini.example for the [DatabaseService] section in case you use 
</I>&gt;<i> Diva.Data.MySQL.dll. I previously had StorageProvider = 
</I>&gt;<i> Diva.Data.MySQL.dll references in a number of other sections 
</I>&gt;<i> (GridService, UserAccounService, GridUserService)  in my Robust.HG.ini 
</I>&gt;<i> file.  can those all be removed now if the StorageProvider in 
</I>&gt;<i> [DatabaseService] is altered?   I commented the other three instances 
</I>&gt;<i> out and it seems to work, but just wanted to be sure as I am aware 
</I>&gt;<i> most things work without the Diva.Data version.
</I>Yes, it works.
