<PRE>I'm trying to use OpenSim for unusual purposes: psychological testing.  In order to give me information about what the user (or, more precisely, their avatar) does, I need to be able to log various things to a text file which can be processed afterwards.  The way I've been doing this without messing with how OpenSim works is to use llSay() with mute on, so that the text doesn't appear on the screen.

I'm not particularly happy with this solution so I thought of whispering instead.  I could use llWhisper() and in the configuration file set the whisper distance to 0.  Does anyone know if this would cause problems with anything else that goes on ?  Perhaps I should set the whisper distance to 0.000001 instead.  Or someone may know of a completely different way to make a text log file.

Ideally I'd be using a special chat channel to do this: perhaps talk to channel 0x7FFFFFFE might just put text directly in a file on disk without showing it on the screen.  It occurs to me that this could be a useful debugging tool for many users, not just myself, and should not interfer with much code which has already been written.  Perhaps it could be added to a future version of OpenSim.  Does anyone think this could be a reasonable feature request ?

Simon.
