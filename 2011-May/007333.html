<PRE>After upgrading from 7.0.2 to 7.1, we left our Diva installation running a
few hours and on checking it this morning it had crashed. We restarted
OpenSim and tried to replicate the crash.

Thinking it had something to do with uploading mesh, we looked and found
some extra prims lying about according to the mini-map, but even after
returning all, there were still 3 or 4 objects obstinately remaining.  We're
thinking those might have been from vehicle scripts we'd tested that had
gone off the sim's edge.

When we used the Phoenix viewer, we got the following error in red on the
console:

[LLCLIENTVIEW]: Caught exception while processing OpenMetaverse.Packe
ts.UpdateInventoryItemPacket for xxxxxx xxxxxxxxx,
[MYSQL GENERIC TABLE HANDLER]: Trying to store field creatorID for
OpenSim.Data.XInventoryItem which is unexpectedly null at
OpenSim.Data.MySQL.MySQLGenericTableHandler`1.Store(T row)

It didn't crash the sim, but we thought it strange to be complaining about a
null creatorID.  We got the same error using Kirsten's viewer; and while
this time the error didn't come up in red, it still appeared on the console
and did not seem to cause a crash.

Another interesting note - when uploading mesh using Kirsten's Viewer, the
object comes in at the sim's edge at zero altitude (z=0).  The SL Mesh
Project Viewer does this as well. It doesn't upload into inventory; it
rezzes inworld.  Do we need to have a completely empty region with no water,
for bringing in mesh?

So. how do we address this null creatorID problem?
