*** About AJET ***
The Australasian Journal of Educational Technology (AJET) (ISSN: 1449-5554) is a refereed academic journal that publishes scholarly research and review articles in educational technology, ICT for education, online and e-learning, educational design, multimedia, computer-assisted learning, and related areas. AJET is the official publication of the Australasian Society for Computers in Learning in Tertiary Education (ascilite at <A HREF="http://www.ascilite.org.au/">http://www.ascilite.org.au/</A>). The journal was published under the title Australian Journal of Educational Technology from 1985 to 2004, after which it was renamed to its current title. In 2008, AJET became an online-only journal, and since that time has prided itself on being an open access publication.

AJET's current Thomson Reuters Impact Factor is 1.278. It ranked 27 out of 139 journals in the 'Education &amp; Educational Research' category in the 2009 ISI Journal Citation Reports, making it one of the highest ranking educational technology journals.
