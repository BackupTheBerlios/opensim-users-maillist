Use GroupPosition[X/Y] and search for &gt; 256 and &lt; 0. You can set those
to someting in-bounds and restart the sim if you want. If you delete
them, then you'll want to remove the associated entries in primshapes
and if they contain inventory, you'll want to remove them from the
primitems table. save the prims for last...

to show the primitems...
SELECT name
FROM `primitems`
WHERE primid
IN (
SELECT uuid
FROM prims
WHERE `GroupPositionX` &lt; '0'
OR `GroupPositionX` &gt; '256'
OR `GroupPositionY` &lt; '0'
OR `GroupPositionY` &gt; '256'
OR `GroupPositionZ` &lt; '-1'
);

to show the primshapes...
SELECT uuid
FROM `primshapes`
WHERE uuid
IN (
SELECT uuid
FROM prims
WHERE `GroupPositionX` &lt; '0'
OR `GroupPositionX` &gt; '256'
OR `GroupPositionY` &lt; '0'
OR `GroupPositionY` &gt; '256'
OR `GroupPositionZ` &lt; '-1'
);

to show the prims...
SELECT Name, `GroupPositionX` , `GroupPositionY` , `GroupPositionZ` ,
UUID, RegionUUID
FROM `prims`
WHERE `GroupPositionX` &lt; '0'
OR `GroupPositionX` &gt; '256'
OR `GroupPositionY` &lt; '0'
OR `GroupPositionY` &gt; '256'
OR `GroupPositionZ` &lt; '-1';


after running these, if you see things that need to be removed, do these
**with the prims table last**...


clean primitems..
DELETE FROM `primitems`
WHERE primid
IN (
SELECT uuid
FROM prims
WHERE `GroupPositionX` &lt; '0'
OR `GroupPositionX` &gt; '256'
OR `GroupPositionY` &lt; '0'
OR `GroupPositionY` &gt; '256'
OR `GroupPositionZ` &lt; '-1'
);

to clean the primshapes...
DELETE FROM `primshapes`
WHERE uuid
IN (
SELECT uuid
FROM prims
WHERE `GroupPositionX` &lt; '0'
OR `GroupPositionX` &gt; '256'
OR `GroupPositionY` &lt; '0'
OR `GroupPositionY` &gt; '256'
OR `GroupPositionZ` &lt; '-1'
);

and last...
DELETE FROM `prims`
WHERE `GroupPositionX` &lt; '0'
OR `GroupPositionX` &gt; '256'
OR `GroupPositionY` &lt; '0'
OR `GroupPositionY` &gt; '256'
OR `GroupPositionZ` &lt; '-1';
