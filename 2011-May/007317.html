I think I'm just going to have individual objects do the whispering.  The other things to do a highly object oriented, and it fits the programming style if I do things like have a drawer whisper &quot;mylog: timestamp: Drawer #6 opened&quot;.  Then I extract every line with the word 'mylog' in.

I didn't know about that.  That's a nice solution for me.  I'll check it out.

</I>
I'm hesitant to start writing my own .NET code.

</I>
I'd like to do this on a stand-alone laptop.  I should definitely have said that in my original post.

&gt;<i> Writing to a notecard via osMakeNotecard might be another approach, though surprisingly there doesn't appear to be an OSSL function that writes lines to an existing notecard.  Maybe there should be one.
</I>
It's really useful for me to be able to get at the log, in a predictable place, after we've stopped the simulation.  I worked out how to access a particular notecard's text using SQL, but it's easier to read the chat log because it's just a particular text file in a particular directory.

Thanks to everyone for their responses.  This list is extremely useful for someone who has to dive into OpenSim very quickly.

Simon.
