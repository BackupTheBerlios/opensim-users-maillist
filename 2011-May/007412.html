<PRE>So I was editing a prim today on a sim-scale build and attempted to change
the X position from 71 to 66 and I think I must have accidentally included
the decimal when I selected the 71, which would have made the new position
66000 instead of 66.000... I'm not even sure if this is what happened, but
the end result was that as soon as I hit 'enter' to commit what I thought
was a 66.000 position, the prim vanished and my selection of it in the build
tool was deactivated, which makes me think it did indeed get shot to
66000m.. this would have taken it off-sim, but no prim was returned to me
due to going off-sim.. so is there any way to find such a lost prim?

Worst case scenario is that I can save today's builds to inventory and then
wipe the sim and restore this morning's OAR file then reposition the new
saved builds, but I'd like to be sure that that missing prim isn't hanging
out somewhere in my installation... 

I've tried searching the mySQL database for prims at PositionX of 6, 66,
66.000 and 66000 but can't find anything. Queries on PositionX = &quot;6%&quot; only
yield results of 6, so the wildcard doesn't seem to work.. 

Any suggestions?
