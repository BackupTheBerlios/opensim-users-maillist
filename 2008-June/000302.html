<PRE>
I have downloaded the SVN trunk OpenSim v0.5.7 and compiled it myself. I have managed to manually create 9 regions placed in a 3x3. I noticed that some of those regions cannot use the terrain command. OpenSim simply says it is an invalid command.

I was using &quot;terrain fill 30&quot; and when I noticed the problem, tried it again all regions and it is always the same regions that OpenSim does not recognize the terrain commands. I had done nothing on those regions since I created them today with the &quot;create-region&quot; command.  I am able to walk on all those 9 regions.

Also, when I wanted to check out the &quot;terrain help&quot; command, it follows the same problem as my other terrain command. So for some unknown reason, the terrain commands simply is not recognized anymore by OpenSim depending on which region you are.

Why ?


I have started working on OpenSim last month and on my spare time, I am trying to create a world. If I disregard all problems I have encountered so far, I estimate I have done so far only 3 hours of productive work. I also frequently search the net for infos on how to do things but some subjects are hard to find (even on SecondLife forum).  I was expecting OpenSim to be more stable, have less problems and that by now I would have made more progress then this.
