</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1)Sounds
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We know the llPlaySound commands etc will play a .wav from prim inventory
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or via UUID, and we know scripts can play streaming audio (shoutcast etc)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or play an .mp3 file (or video) from a prim which changes the parcel/media
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> settings to the url.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But, I wondered if it's possible to play a longer sound residing on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> same server as opensim- which leads to project;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2)- an analog clock which currently plays a chime on the hour on my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> building's tower- wanting to mod the script to play on the quarter hour
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the traditional series of so called &quot;Westminster chimes&quot; which are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> obviously longer than 10 seconds each, especially on the 3/4 hour
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sequence.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I know 10 sec clips can be strung together in a prim, but was trying to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> see if there's a way to call it with the sound file residing on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> server/localhost, since mySQL and OS are all running off localhost to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> begin with.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3)Rotation of a prim, this youtube video  below shows what I would like to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rotate and how- the crank arm of a steam engine, which as can be seen in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the video would rotate in 2 directions- x-y (forward-back as well as one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> end of the prim rotating 360 degrees in an arc;

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have the engine mostly build, and the flywheel scripted to rotate, I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> also found a swing script and &quot;cut&quot; a prim, inserted the script and linked
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it to the shaft I want to rotate, this mostly does what I want but does
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not move x-y.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The secondary horzontal connecting shaft needs only move horizontally x-y
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a small amount for best effects but I haven't found a script that will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> move a prim just x-y for that.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The Engine itself can be seen on the Wolf Reference Library region at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 225,231,21 the 2 scripts I am trying are on now.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think aside from my 3 projects- others, not just myself could make a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> broader use of any findings and solutions found for these 3 tasks.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Timber
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> WesternPrairie.net
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Part of the problem with sound in opensim id not all the sound commands seems to be working. There was a way of cutting
</I>&gt;<i> up sound files and pre-loading them with a small cache to play entire songs. This small caching had to do with a
</I>&gt;<i> llSetSoundQueueing &lt;<A HREF="http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/LlSetSoundQueueing">http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/LlSetSoundQueueing</A>&gt; command.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not only that but I found sounds in opensim cause a sound being played to be cut off and stopped when another object
</I>&gt;<i> starts another sound. Unlike SL that allows one sound to complete even as the other starts up. I made a rain shower that
</I>&gt;<i> had a falling rain sound accompanying the rain in a loop. When another object a lightning effect set off and played the
</I>&gt;<i> thunder the rain sound was cut off completely. So after each lightning effect the sound of the rain stopped. I am
</I>&gt;<i> waiting for opensim to fix this sound before I try that again. I didn't add it to the error reports. I felt it wasn't on
</I>&gt;<i> the top of their list of fixes right now and there where more pressing matters to contend with.
</I>
Yes, llSetSoundQueueing() is not currently implemented in OpenSimulator.
