<PRE>&quot;Not sure if you typed that backwards in your email but did it correctly
when you were creating the database, but assuming your database name and
database username are both opensim, then it should be:

grant all on opensim.* to 'opensim'@'localhost';

Not <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-users">localhost at opensim...</A>&quot;

That is a real easy mistake to make and Chris is correct, in the command
line the syntax IS 'opensim'@'localhost';
with no spaces around the @ and all the ' and semi colon as shown.

I prefer a GUI interface for administering the mySQL database, but have
done both command line and GUI.
Don't forget that if you are using the command line, you'll need to log in
as root in the terminal. I run openSUSE linux now so in that it's; su
Also, it's real easy to forget to START mySQL if it's stopped since it
runs in the background mostly unseen.

It's easy to verify the grant and user have been taken, in linux mysql
after logging in to it I just type; SHOW GRANTS FOR <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-users">opensim at localhost</A>;

I just set up a local instance of OS on my now decommissioned pc/server
running xp since I have the box, and thought it would be good to have a
complete backup on it running.
It was really a snap setting it up, and it uses the mySQL database install
 that it was using when it was in grid mode, but I installed the opensim
version of opensim on this rather than the OSgrid version since it's
already configured for standalone.
