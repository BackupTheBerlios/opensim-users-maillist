<PRE>Hi everyone, hello Simon Slavin, Cider Jack, Edmund Edgar,

I am a vivid fan of the technology behind bitcons,
since it provides as much as possible transparency of financial
transactions.

Also the idea, a user generated currency, (actually a cpu/gpu generated
currency)
is a compelling approach, which I also use in my concept for a user
generated (education/skill) currency, The Geo.

The issue i have with bitcoins is, that it will not solve the mentioned
current (and past) problem (&quot;big banks (the 1%)&quot;),
just the protagonists change. The early adopters of bitcoins do posses most
of the currency.
You can compare that with the first settlers who came to America, they
could claim larger areas than the following.
And just as physical land, the amount of bitcoins is limited.

Agreeing with Cider Jack, that an universal currency for virtual worlds is
eligible,
I would like to ask for the possibility to implement multiple, different
approaches of currency systems,
to let the users choose their preferred one.

I propose the use of The Geo (the way Geo is created) as currency and the
technology of bitcoins.

Here some facts about The Geo:
The currency is unser generated/created by taking part in skill or
knowledge achieving activities.
It incorporates a 'Citizen's Dividend', a basic income guarantee for
unique, active participants.
It will be observed by the community, since transactions will be fully
transparent.
The currency will be run by a nonprofit organization.

Here is a short draft of The Geo:

Here is a link to a website about a basic income guarantee:

Regards,

Marcus
P.S. &quot;A teacher - who shares his knowledge - creates real value, value none
can take away from you,
even during an economic crisis.&quot;

&gt;<i> Bitcoin (or a similar system) would be ideal for OpenSim, IMO. The

</I>&gt;<i> Edgar mentioned and some caveats such as Simon mentions as well. It's

</I>&gt;<i> of when &amp; how.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim appears to be an ideal community to introduce a system and

</I>&gt;<i> all they can to outlaw it, or discredit &amp; destroy it as soon as it
</I>&gt;<i> becomes in any way viable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, the idea fills me with both dread and excitement. These are
</I>&gt;<i> very interesting times we are living in!
