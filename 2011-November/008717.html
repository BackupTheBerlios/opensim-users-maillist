<PRE>Ok ill try to give my two cents on testing the modules 
Everything worked well with one consistent anomaly
I run my ain server configured with windows 7 professional edition
I also run the ZEND server community edition 
Apache 2.2.16
PHP 5.3.5
MySql 5.1.50

My main server which hosts the profiles module runs dual optron 6186
processors and has 8 gigs of ram
All the modules work perfectly with as I have said with one anomaly
No problems with the 7.1.1 version and the 7.3 DEV version

However with the 7.2 release the profiles module acts problematically
It seem Picks will load and my notes seem to work
Also the web page I have placed in to the profile will load correctly
However Interests and Avatar Information doesn't seem to load

I know if I put information in them and click ok and then open on a sim
running 7.1.1 the information I placed there in the 7.2 sim shows up
The Avatar information also shows the avatar as being Born 1/1/1970(15307
Days Old)

I'm running a grid configuration with the main sim's accessing the MySql for
region data
The other connections to the grid are using sql lite for region data as I
still haven't figured how to connect to mysql from another computer
OS Grid seem to use this configuration

The remote grid connection I am testing out is being run from my laptop
connected to a modem with direct access to the internet

I hope this information will be helpful

now that more people are testing the modules, i think it's a perfect 
time to start collecting error vs environment information.  i realize 
that the mantis holds pages and pages of error documentation, but now 
that there is a constant value (everyone is using the same module 
code/versions) it should be easier to compare and contrast the other 
variables.  in my documentation i listed the specific conditions under 
which i had success (i.e. platform, OS version, mono/sql/php versions) 
so those having errors should include the same data here (or in emails 
for those who are contacting me directly) and treat it like a smaller, 
more informal mantis.  this will also help to create better 'contingency 
documentation' for future wiki updates or tutorials.

as for the profiles issue Chris mentioned, i wasn't able to re-create 
the problem, though i do remember experiencing it before.  unfortunately 
i can't recall the specific circumstances under which it occurred :/  
were there any error messages in the console?

there has also been a recent update to the search module and i believe 
one pending for the profile as well.  for bundle fans, i'll be posting 
an updated download soon.

best to all.
