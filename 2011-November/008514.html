<PRE>Don't people run networks and servers and businesses using Linux? And
make a profit doing so? How many region and grid hosting services that
charge for those services use Linux on their servers? Servers that run
OpenSim for those regions and grids.

If I spend my time and energy maintaining a grid, dealing with
customer complaints, answering general inquiries, dealing with
copyright issues, paying the utilities, and all the other things that
I have to do to keep that grid running using OpenSim, shouldn't I be
compensated for the expenditure of my time, energy and finances?

Some people see the metaverse as a hobby. An entertainment that they
can share with others, be they friends and family, or the general
public. Others see a potential to start their own business using an
emerging technology. And still others see the educational prospects
for using OpenSim. But the reality is, for each and every one of us,
we need to eat. We need to pay the rent. We need to cover the costs of
the hardware to run those grids.

TANSTAAFL :-)
