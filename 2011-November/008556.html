<PRE>I have to maintain several regions in several grids. I have been quickly bored of playing with one account for each grid and transferring data between the with IAR, OAR and drop inventory. So, I wanted to give a try to a special config. 

I should be able to set up a simulator, using most of my main grid's services (assets, inv, auth&#8230;) but connection regions to another grid.

Please don't just tell me it can't work. I made the test and it does!

That said, I would like to hear your thoughts about it, if you suspect  upcoming problems, and if you have better ideas to achieve that. Or if it is really foolish, but in this case, explain why ;-).

For now, I have a main grid, my &quot;home&quot; grid, which is speculoos.net
	<A HREF="secondlife://speculoos.net:8002/">secondlife://speculoos.net:8002/</A>
Aside, I have a simulator running a test region in OSGrid, &quot;Belgium Jump&quot; 
	<A HREF="secondlife://hg.osgrid.org:80:Belgium%20Jump/">secondlife://hg.osgrid.org:80:Belgium%20Jump/</A>

The &quot;foreign&quot; simulator has the same settings as my &quot;home&quot; sims, excepts these (which are set with OSGrid &quot;standard&quot; values):
	
	&#8226; GridServerURI
	&#8226; Gatekeeper
	&#8226; AvatarServerURI
	&#8226; PresenceServerURI

As for now, it seems to work fine, I have no particular error logged, and it sounds like my users as well as osgrid users are able to tp in, access inventory, etc&#8230; Some behaviors happen the same way as if user hypergridded (like viewing profile, adding friends&#8230;) but that's expected. 

More details of the test on <A HREF="http://www.speculoos.net/en/lab/decentralization/">http://www.speculoos.net/en/lab/decentralization/</A>
