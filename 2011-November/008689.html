<PRE>I have 3 little projects I would like to do on my non-profit sims but
wanted to find out first if they are possible, and if so, how it can be
done.

1)Sounds

We know the llPlaySound commands etc will play a .wav from prim inventory
or via UUID, and we know scripts can play streaming audio (shoutcast etc)
or play an .mp3 file (or video) from a prim which changes the parcel/media
settings to the url.
But, I wondered if it's possible to play a longer sound residing on the
same server as opensim- which leads to project;

2)- an analog clock which currently plays a chime on the hour on my
building's tower- wanting to mod the script to play on the quarter hour
the traditional series of so called &quot;Westminster chimes&quot; which are
obviously longer than 10 seconds each, especially on the 3/4 hour
sequence.
I know 10 sec clips can be strung together in a prim, but was trying to
see if there's a way to call it with the sound file residing on the
server/localhost, since mySQL and OS are all running off localhost to
begin with.

3)Rotation of a prim, this youtube video  below shows what I would like to
rotate and how- the crank arm of a steam engine, which as can be seen in
the video would rotate in 2 directions- x-y (forward-back as well as one
end of the prim rotating 360 degrees in an arc;

<A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7AVjxxlJRI">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7AVjxxlJRI</A>

I have the engine mostly build, and the flywheel scripted to rotate, I
also found a swing script and &quot;cut&quot; a prim, inserted the script and linked
it to the shaft I want to rotate, this mostly does what I want but does
not move x-y.
The secondary horzontal connecting shaft needs only move horizontally x-y
a small amount for best effects but I haven't found a script that will
move a prim just x-y for that.

The Engine itself can be seen on the Wolf Reference Library region at
225,231,21 the 2 scripts I am trying are on now.

I think aside from my 3 projects- others, not just myself could make a
broader use of any findings and solutions found for these 3 tasks.
