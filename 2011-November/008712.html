Part of the problem with sound in opensim id not all the sound commands 
seems to be working.  There was a way of cutting up sound files and 
pre-loading them with a small cache to play entire songs.  This small 
caching had to do with a llSetSoundQueueing 
&lt;<A HREF="http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/LlSetSoundQueueing">http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/LlSetSoundQueueing</A>&gt; command.

Not only that but I found sounds in opensim cause a sound being played 
to be cut off and stopped when another object starts another sound. 
Unlike SL that allows one sound to complete even as the other starts 
up.  I made a rain shower that had a falling rain sound accompanying   
the rain in a loop.  When another object a lightning effect set off and 
played the thunder the rain sound was cut off completely.  So after each 
lightning effect the sound of the rain stopped.  I am waiting for 
opensim to fix this sound before I try that again.  I didn't add it to 
the error reports.  I felt it wasn't on the top of their list of fixes 
right now and there where more pressing matters to contend with.
