<PRE>Bitcoin (or a similar system) would be ideal for OpenSim, IMO. The
need for a &quot;universal&quot; virtual currency for use among virtual worlds
is real. Bitcoin is a system already in place, with the advantages
Edgar mentioned and some caveats such as Simon mentions as well. It's
also already had a few other issues, including hoarding, rumors of
theft &amp; counterfeiting, not to mention the recent collapse in exchange
value.

I personally expect that a single currency that works seamlessly in
both virtual &amp; real world will happen eventually. It's just a question
of when &amp; how.

OpenSim appears to be an ideal community to introduce a system and
work out the bugs before taking it to the next step (into the
real-world side of things). Decentralization is mandatory, as is
security of course. Not easy barriers to overcome! Not to mention, the
big banks (the 1%) that control the current real-world economy will do
all they can to outlaw it, or discredit &amp; destroy it as soon as it
becomes in any way viable.

Anyway, the idea fills me with both dread and excitement. These are
very interesting times we are living in!

Cheers,
~!CJ
