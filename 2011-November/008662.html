<PRE>Hi Chris I had the same problem running version 7.2 release
I tried it with 7.1.1 and it worked fine as well as the 7.3 Dev version for
os grid
I modified the ini files to fit my grid
But why it happens I do not know
You are right the information does go to the database I checked that using 2
simulators but for some reason the viewer is not reading the information
properly

I was also able to install your bundle following your setup guide as 
well with minimal issue =)

Just as a note for Windows users using MySQL Admin (No I haven't 
switched over to the newer GUI Workbench ... It's a real PITA to work 
with =| ) you may need to check the box to ignore errors when restoring 
the tables for services_all.sql file. I ran into errors with it 
unchecked. But it seems to be working fine after checking that box 
despite the fact.

Thanks a lot for this package Core!

On a side note... Would anyone happen to know why text typed into the 
profiles about box, etc doesn't want to persist? The apply button is 
there, is clickable, and the data does seem to be finding its way to the 
MySQL database upon querying it; but other wise won't show up when the 
edited profile is re-opened.

Groups seems to be working fine. I was able to create a new group and 
assign different roles, etc. Though I have not tested farther than this 
(Deeding land, objects, etc.)

I do not know how well search works as I did not opt to install and 
configure this option.
