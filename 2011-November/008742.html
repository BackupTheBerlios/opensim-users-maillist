<PRE>Hey all,

I am currently working on a user account interface for Open Simulator.
Though I must say that My skills in PHP are very limited as I am still
learning I figured it would be nice to have this kind of tool for Open
Simulator. I would also like to open the table to anyone who would like to
help with this project as it would benefit all of us for easier access to
our respective grids.

This is what the system will have access to and what it can do:

User Accounts - Add, Edit, Delete, Block(I am not sure if a block feature
is enabled on Open Simulator)
User Inventory - View, Delete
User Land - Add, View, Edit, Delete(For this feature there will need to be
a main account for the land to be assigned to. Much like Second Life's
Governor Linden)

One thing I would like to look into is adding an Account Status system to
this. Basically the ability to hold an account for a specific reason that
corresponds with a numeric or alpha numeric code.

Any suggestions would be helpful as this system is still in planning and
early development. There are a lot of tools out there but they seem to be
out of date or extremely difficult to install. One thing this system would
need is the ability to link with other servers connected to the grid. Which
reminds me, Is there a way to set up that ONLY specific region servers can
connect to a grid server?

Thanks
