<PRE>thank you for your kind words, Gwyn.  as far as the bundle is concerned, 
it is made up of material which already falls under OpenSim's BSD 
licence and can therefore be modified and re-distributed under those 
same conditions.  my apologies for not including that point in the 
documentation.  i believe this is the correct info:

<A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/BSD_License">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/BSD_License</A>
<A HREF="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php">http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php</A>

i'm also interested in your ideas regarding the Incutio library.  it 
makes sense to tap into existing resources in order to increase 
compatibility and create a softer landing point for developers looking 
to integrate OS with an established CMS.  if i had make a personal 
choice (also avoiding a code war), Drupal would top my list simply 
because they have turned a smart corner with the upcoming version and 
are integrating the HTML5/CSS3 feature family into the engine itself.  
admittedly, i'm a sucker for environments with high upward compatibility.

-however-

i completely agree that Wordpress is a good choice for many reasons as 
well.  the plugin architecture is hard to beat let alone the vast 
installation base and immense third-party development community.  i look 
forward to anything you create for that engine.

i will hold my tongue in regards to Xoops except to say that if not for 
Moodle, i'd have little or no reason to even touch it (and i know i'm 
not alone in that sentiment).

</I>&gt;<i> I've finally given your package a try, after losing nights of sleep
</I>&gt;<i> getting the individual modules a try.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First, I would like to thank you very much for all your work. For
</I>&gt;<i> anyone who wishes to give the external services a try, the fundamental
</I>&gt;<i> thing is the readme file you've assembled together &#8212; because it
</I>&gt;<i> explains *all* necessary steps. The wiki and the individual readme
</I>&gt;<i> files are simply incomplete. There are far more steps which I hadn't
</I>&gt;<i> found described anywhere. Just for that, the package is worth all
</I>&gt;<i> trouble :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Groups work flawlessly. But as a matter of fact, they always worked.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Offline IMs finally work! I'm not sure if this is supposed to work for
</I>&gt;<i> Group Chat IMs as well. And from the code, I'm assuming that
</I>&gt;<i> IM-to-email is not implemented, but it should be possible to add that
</I>&gt;<i> functionality. How exactly that is supposed to integrate with the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;main&quot; database (specially because I have all these options on a
</I>&gt;<i> different server, using a different MySQL database...), I'm not sure
</I>&gt;<i> (e.g. making sure that the IM-to-email option on the user preferences,
</I>&gt;<i> when checked, actually sends IMs to email &#8212; which, in my case, are
</I>&gt;<i> done by a _different_ server. I'm not yet sure how to do that!)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Profiles and Search... don't work. When looking at what was happening
</I>&gt;<i> (on two different servers &#8212; one running Mac OS X and the other
</I>&gt;<i> Linux/Cent OS 5.3 &#8212; to make sure that the problem was not related to
</I>&gt;<i> Mono or the spoecific architecture), this is what I got:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [PROFILE]: Unable to connect to Profile Server
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://btgrid.betatechnologies.info/os_services/profiles/profile.php.">http://btgrid.betatechnologies.info/os_services/profiles/profile.php.</A>
</I>&gt;<i> Method avatar_properties_request, params System.Collections.Hashtable.
</I>&gt;<i> Exception System.Xml.XmlException: Multiple document element was
</I>&gt;<i> detected.  Line 2, position 2.

</I>&gt;<i> [0x00000] in&lt;filename unknown&gt;:0
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sounds cryptic? Not really &#8212; I found out that my stupid hosting
</I>&gt;<i> provider doesn't have the required XML-RPC library built-in. Ack! (I
</I>&gt;<i> just copied&amp;  pasted this here because Google will eventually pick it
</I>&gt;<i> up sooner or later, and hopefully this message will be helpful for
</I>&gt;<i> anyone searching for the same issue. If that's the case, fellow
</I>&gt;<i> Google-user, be content, the modules are working, it's just your PHP
</I>&gt;<i> which hasn't the XML-RPC library built in).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Workaround? In my case, I'm not really allowed to change the PHP
</I>&gt;<i> module, since it's not under my control. Well, I have gone through
</I>&gt;<i> this before, and I'm going to try to adapt the code to use the
</I>&gt;<i> well-known Incutio XML-RPC library, which is used by WordPress (and
</I>&gt;<i> thus about 1/6th of all websites in the world) and thus should be
</I>&gt;<i> reasonably efficient and safe. Sadly, of course, it means rewriting a
</I>&gt;<i> lot of code, since the approach is rather different. But if I get this
</I>&gt;<i> to work I might post a copy of the code somewhere.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Actually, if Mimetic Core is reading this, I would like to ask your
</I>&gt;<i> permission to use your module to include it as part of an upcoming
</I>&gt;<i> WordPress plugin I'm planning to do. After a terrible experience with
</I>&gt;<i> Xoops I vowed never to use it again :-) And while the academic
</I>&gt;<i> community is very fond of Moodle &#8212; and there are already a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> modules working with Moodle doing basically the same thing &#8212; 67
</I>&gt;<i> million sites run WordPress (<A HREF="http://en.wordpress.com/stats/">http://en.wordpress.com/stats/</A>) so I
</I>&gt;<i> believe there might be some interest using it as a backend for
</I>&gt;<i> managing a grid. Note that this is a very-long-time project, to which
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not going to do &quot;in a moment's notice&quot;, since the whole point is
</I>&gt;<i> to allow things like authentication, profiles, and social networking
</I>&gt;<i> tools (like BuddyPress) and forums all be integrated uniformly into a
</I>&gt;<i> single setup. And no, this is not to get into a &quot;CMS war&quot;; and yes,
</I>&gt;<i> I'm aware that the same could be achieved &#8212; possibly more easily &#8212;
</I>&gt;<i> starting with Moodle or even Drupal, both of which already have
</I>&gt;<i> several modules to integrate with OpenSim.
