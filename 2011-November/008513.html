<PRE>Hi all,

Given the problems I had with installing Xoopensim, I decided to go the
other route and try to install the various modules individually for groups
and profiles and so on.

First note: I noticed that there are two pages on the wiki, when I think
there should perhaps only be one, or one should redirect to the other:

<A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Groups">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Groups</A> is the first page, and it seems
incomplete.

<A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Enabling_Groups">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Enabling_Groups</A> is the second page, and its
instructions are much more fleshed out and clear.

The first page should probably redirect or link to the second page, no?


Second note:  I ran into problems installing the XmpRpcGroupsServer at
first, and finally after some digging around discovered the problem was
that I installed MySQL with the utf8 charset, and due to this bug:
<A HREF="http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=4541">http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=4541</A> some of the tables needed for the
groups functionality were not being created.  Upon trying to create the
tables, I was getting an error message:

Specified key was too long; max key length is 1000 bytes

Since all things considered we hadn't done too much with anything yet, I
resintalled MySQL with the latin1 charset and voila, the groups
functionality seems to be working perfectly.

Before I notate the groups page about this problem, I just wanted to
confirm that anyone else has seen this error with utf8 and resolved it with
the latin1 charset?  Are the folks who developed the XmlRpcGroupsServer
planning to fix this issue for those who need international characters?

Is this a known problem and I'm just behind the curve (as usual)?
