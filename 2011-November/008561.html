<PRE>Hi Gwyn!

That's really quite interesting as I had the opposite experience initially
- the Xoopensim groups were the only thing that DID work out of the gate on
FleepGrid (WinXP, MySQL 5.1, latin1 charset) but I couldn't even install
Xoopensim at all on the University of Cincinnati grid (WinServer 2008 R2,
MySQL 5.5.16, utf8).

I decided to downgrade UC's MySQL version to MySQL 5.1.59 thinking that
might be the issue with Xoopensim, but still couldn't get that to install,
then tried the XmlRpcGroupsServer and ran into the MySQL bug about
character length, reinstalled MySQL for the third time to change the
charset to latin1 and finally got XmlRpcGroupsServer to work.

I still cannot get OSProfile or OSSearch to work, but finally DID get
Offline IMs working thanks to jor3l.

All in all the module installation experience has been quite painful, I
must say.  For my part, I am fairly novice at most of this so I tend to
assume if something isn't working it's probably because I did something
idiotic, but if I ever get things actually working I want to try to help
improve the documentation in terms that a novice like me can understand,
because most of the instructions assume either that the user is running on
linux or they assume much more implicit knowledge about the process than I
actually have.

I'm trying to document my experiences in as much detail as I can muster,
for FleepGrid the change log is at <A HREF="http://fleep.wikispaces.com/FleepGrid">http://fleep.wikispaces.com/FleepGrid</A> and
for the UC Grid at <A HREF="http://ucopensim.wikispaces.com/Server+Change+Log">http://ucopensim.wikispaces.com/Server+Change+Log</A> so if
those details help anyone, I'm glad to hear it.

Wishing you best of luck too!

- Chris/Fleep

&gt;<i> Hi Fleep,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In my case, things are a bit unclear. The original database I used for
</I>&gt;<i> Groups came from the XmlRpcGroupsServer that I had downloaded in May 2010.
</I>&gt;<i> This works flawlessly, to my bafflement and surprise, using UTF8 under
</I>&gt;<i> MySQL 5.1.53/Linux. It worked under 0.7.0.1 and 0.7.0.2, and it did not
</I>&gt;<i> stop working under 0.7.2 (I skipped 0.7.1 :) ). Since it works so well, I'm
</I>&gt;<i> scared to touch any of it &#8212; either the code from May 2010, or the created
</I>&gt;<i> tables :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When installing Xoopensim (yes, I've been following your experiences and
</I>&gt;<i> trying to replicate them as best as possible!), I thought I ought to give
</I>&gt;<i> Xoopensim's built-in groups a try. Although the databases created are a
</I>&gt;<i> perfect replica of what XmlRpcGroupsServer uses &#8212; they don't work. When
</I>&gt;<i> copying over exactly the same content I had in the &quot;old&quot; tables to
</I>&gt;<i> Xoopensim's own &#8212; Groups stopped working.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I gave up on Xoopensim's groups and went back to XmlRpcGroupsServer's
</I>&gt;<i> instead. They remain functional. Again, they're in UTF8. As a matter of
</I>&gt;<i> fact, Groups are the *only* thing I can get to work (well, and the Broker,
</I>&gt;<i> too, because that at least has such an easy protocol that I wrote something
</I>&gt;<i> quickly &#8212; even though it's less useful than I thought, I imagined I'd get
</I>&gt;<i> at least the *name* of the avatar that changed regions). Everything else
</I>&gt;<i> refuses to work. Profiles worked under 0.6.9 or so, but not since the
</I>&gt;<i> upgrade to 0.7.X, and it's hard to say &quot;why&quot; &#8212; I just get &quot;slow POST
</I>&gt;<i> requests&quot; and unacknowledged LLSD packets &#8212; and both OSProfiles and
</I>&gt;<i> Xoopensim's own implementation give similar results.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> From the error you describe, I might just have been lucky and not require
</I>&gt;<i> long keys, and that's why I managed to create those tables back in May
</I>&gt;<i> 2010, but I guess that an alternative to keep as most of the code using
</I>&gt;<i> UTF8 as possible, is to change the key length somewhere. Now if one could
</I>&gt;<i> figure out *where*, it would be tremendously helpful :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,

</I>&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Given the problems I had with installing Xoopensim, I decided to go the
</I>&gt;<i> other route and try to install the various modules individually for groups
</I>&gt;<i> and profiles and so on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First note: I noticed that there are two pages on the wiki, when I think
</I>&gt;<i> there should perhaps only be one, or one should redirect to the other:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Groups">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Groups</A> is the first page, and it seems
</I>&gt;<i> incomplete.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Enabling_Groups">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Enabling_Groups</A> is the second page, and its
</I>&gt;<i> instructions are much more fleshed out and clear.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The first page should probably redirect or link to the second page, no?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Second note:  I ran into problems installing the XmpRpcGroupsServer at
</I>&gt;<i> first, and finally after some digging around discovered the problem was
</I>&gt;<i> that I installed MySQL with the utf8 charset, and due to this bug:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=4541">http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=4541</A> some of the tables needed for the
</I>&gt;<i> groups functionality were not being created.  Upon trying to create the
</I>&gt;<i> tables, I was getting an error message:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Specified key was too long; max key length is 1000 bytes
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since all things considered we hadn't done too much with anything yet, I
</I>&gt;<i> resintalled MySQL with the latin1 charset and voila, the groups
</I>&gt;<i> functionality seems to be working perfectly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Before I notate the groups page about this problem, I just wanted to
</I>&gt;<i> confirm that anyone else has seen this error with utf8 and resolved it with
</I>&gt;<i> the latin1 charset?  Are the folks who developed the XmlRpcGroupsServer
</I>&gt;<i> planning to fix this issue for those who need international characters?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is this a known problem and I'm just behind the curve (as usual)?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> :)
