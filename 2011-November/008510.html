As a long time supporter of open source, it seems strange to expect to 
charge small sums of money for small improvements, when you sit on top 
of a totally selfless free gift of a huge project like OpenSim. Everyone 
of us are in &quot;gift debt&quot; to OpenSim and the cast of people who have 
freely contributed code improvements, especially to Second Life for 
releasing code to the Open Source community and to Darren Guard for 
busting his hump with it.

How to repay that debt?? By offering up some improvement without 
expectation of repayment, in the like manner you received the &quot;gift&quot;. 
That's pretty much the sum total of the GPL and OpenSource notions.

Then, there is the matter of bookkeeping, and then someone will want a 
percentage of that to administer it, creating another IMF style banking 
system with it's burden of administrative executive ~leeches~ who will 
inevitably either live lavishly at the expense of others or run off with 
the money ala Wall Street. You SURE you want to go there?? In the long 
run, it might be better to pay off on the gift-debt to the group first 
before thinking about individual minuscule profits. That might not be a 
bad notion to teach kids, too.

Suppose OpenSim decided to charge a site license fee, if there were 
profits to be made? Wouldn't that be fair? Would you be open to paying a 
fee up-front first? Or, should the devels just bend over for anyone 
wishing to make a buck from their gift, while pissing on their shoes? In 
the real world, profits are what's left after expenses and taxes. Up 
until now we're thankfully free of both, thanks to the OpenSim 
development group. My two-cents, Ric
