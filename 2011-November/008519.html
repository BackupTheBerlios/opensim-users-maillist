<PRE>(i'm re-posting my last message for the digest reply haters)

just to add another layer to this discussion, at least from a historical 
perspective, here is a radio piece NPR ran back in August on Planet 
Money about Bitcoin and its origins.  i only reference this because it's 
an interesting story and regardless of it's relationship to OpenSim 
(though i would love to see it become the standard currency for virtual 
worlds) it has a whole lot to do with the growing decentralized open 
source mindset [coughs]...

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - What is Bitcoin? -
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Bitcoin is a decentralized, peer-to-peer electronic currency.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is no central organization controlling Bitcoins. Records of what
</I>&gt;<i> money has been spend are stored all over the network, by the computers
</I>&gt;<i> of people who participate in it. Whether a Bitcoin is genuine or not
</I>&gt;<i> is judged by rules in the Bitcoin client software, which is free and
</I>&gt;<i> open source.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> See <A HREF="http://www.bitcoin.org">http://www.bitcoin.org</A> for an explanation of how it works, how
</I>&gt;<i> money is generated, and how the system prevents you from spending the
</I>&gt;<i> same money twice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Why are people interested in Bitcoin? -
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Technology has made most kinds of interactions between people freer,
</I>&gt;<i> more open and more decentralized. The exception is money, which used
</I>&gt;<i> to be based on a decentralized, peer-to-peer model (people implicitly
</I>&gt;<i> agreed on a particular hard-to-obtain shiny metal to represent value),
</I>&gt;<i> and has gradually become more centralized and controlled.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The practical problem with that is that people like PayPal, who
</I>&gt;<i> control electronic tranfers, are very nasty to do business with. They
</I>&gt;<i> take a massive chunk of commission, they can arbitrarily lock your
</I>&gt;<i> account, and they can shut down people they don't like on a whim, or
</I>&gt;<i> due to political pressure. This last thing is what happened to
</I>&gt;<i> Wikileaks; They were easily able to work around attempts to shut down
</I>&gt;<i> their DNS and their server hosting, but the US government (without a
</I>&gt;<i> court order or anything like that) was able to stop payment processors
</I>&gt;<i> from transferring donations to them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There's a lot that can go wrong with systems that need a central,
</I>&gt;<i> trusted authority, which is why people building the open internet have
</I>&gt;<i> tried to avoid them wherever practical.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - How could this work for the open metaverse -
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Linden model is that there's a trusted company that keeps records
</I>&gt;<i> of all the money. When you make a transfer or a sale, they move the
</I>&gt;<i> money from one account to the other.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We don't like that because it means we either have to trust a company
</I>&gt;<i> that keeps those records, or - even worse, for someone running a sim -
</I>&gt;<i> _be_ the company that keeps those records.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A better model, that is possible with Bitcoin, is to put everyone in
</I>&gt;<i> control of their own money. You'd keep your money on your own
</I>&gt;<i> computer, transfer it easily to another avatar when you want to, and
</I>&gt;<i> have some way of letting whatever system was in charge of storing
</I>&gt;<i> inventory that the transfer was happening. If we wanted this could be
</I>&gt;<i> integrated with the client so that you could make payments and
</I>&gt;<i> purchases seamlessly in-world, like you do on the Linden grid.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is great for me, because I don't have to put my trust in somebody
</I>&gt;<i> running a money server, and it's great for people running sims,
</I>&gt;<i> because they don't have to baby-sit people's money, with all the
</I>&gt;<i> security and (potentially) regulatory issues that involves.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A harder question is how we get from our current software (based on
</I>&gt;<i> the Linden model) to there. There may be something we can do quicker
</I>&gt;<i> (like hacking Bitcoin integration into Fumi Iseki's money server) that
</I>&gt;<i> would get some of the benefits of Bitcoin without going to the full
</I>&gt;<i> decentralized model.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
