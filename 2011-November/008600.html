Subject: [Opensim-users] Region not part of an estate

I recently fired up opensim again after being shutdown for a move to
another state. The problem I'm having is that each time I try to create a
new region or load the regions from my regions.ini file, opensim crashes
with the message: &quot;Region .... is not part of an estate.&quot;

This is one of the most annoying errors I can think of, and it seems I've
run into this (as have others) numerous times.
Removing the regions.ini file only gets you as far as the estate question
and then it quits.

I seem to remember the fix I wound up doing was installing a new copy of
opensim- the same version if possible, or if not- the neewest version, and
then doing the usual copying the values over from the opensim.ini and the
gridcommon.ini- mysql connection string, DB name etc and any mods you did
in there for chat distance and so forth, and then start up and let it
create a new single region with whatever name and location, and new estate
name, and after loaded and up quitting, removing the regions.ini file and
replacing it with my saved one and restarting.

I'm sure there's easier ways but I just found sometimes putting a new
install in just eliminates problems of missing files, corrupt files or
whatever may have happened in a folder sitting on a pc, and starts off
with a new fresh copy.
the mysql db should not need to be changed, but you could if you wanted to
as long as you have your OARS safely saved.
