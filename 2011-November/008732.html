<PRE>I sure you've probably tried everything but go to the consol and list
modules and make sure the profiles module is loaded mine shows up at the
bottom of the list

The search module should be there too

 

The following bits of code need to be placed into your opensim ini file

 

[Profile]

     Enabled = true

     Module = OpenProfileModule

    ; Change it to your own HTTP server to have the Profile server work

              ;ProfileURL = MOODLE_URL/blocks/modlos/helper/profile.php

              ProfileURL = <A HREF="http://xxx.xx.xx.xx/osprofile/php/profile.php">http://xxx.xx.xx.xx/osprofile/php/profile.php</A>

 

[Modules]

    LandServices = &quot;RemoteLandServicesConnector&quot;

    LandServiceConnector = &quot;true&quot;

 

   [Modules]

    Module = OpenSearchModule 

 

    [Search]

    Enabled = True

   ; This is the URL needed for Search server to work  

   ; Change it to your own HTTP server to have Search inworld working

   ;SearchURL = MOODLE_URL/blocks/modlos/helper/query.php

    SearchURL = <A HREF="http://xxx.xx.xx.xx/ossearch/webroot/query.php">http://xxx.xx.xx.xx/ossearch/webroot/query.php</A>

 

Some of this might be unnessary but that's how mine is configured

Just point the url to your server and pathway in the zend server

 

Also with offline messages the mute server needs to be uncommented even if
its not pointing to any particular url

Or offline messages won,t work

 

Hope this was helpful

Hi Gary,

 

Windows 7

IIS7

MySQL 5.5

 

I'm running Zend as well to control my groups and it works perfectly.
However, to date, I can not get any of the core modules to work. Profiles,
offline messages, and search write nothing to the database.  No console
errors that indicate anything is having trouble connecting either. The only
message I get is &quot;Unable to fetch profile data at this time&quot; from the viewer
code when I try to modify my profile.

 

When sending a message to someone off line, I do get the following console
message:

 

ERROR - OpenSim.Framework.Servers.HttpServer.BaseHttpServer [BASE HTTP
SERVER]: Handler not found for http request
/offline/Offline.php/SaveMessage/
2011-11-28 11:00:11,708 DEBUG -
OpenSim.Framework.SynchronousRestObjectRequester
[SynchronousRestObjectRequester]: Invalid XML
<A HREF="http://enakai.dyndns-server.com:11000/offline/Offline.php/SaveMessage/">http://enakai.dyndns-server.com:11000/offline/Offline.php/SaveMessage/</A>
System.Boolean
 

Out of ideas.

 

Wayne

Ok ill try to give my two cents on testing the modules
Everything worked well with one consistent anomaly
I run my ain server configured with windows 7 professional edition
I also run the ZEND server community edition
Apache 2.2.16
PHP 5.3.5
MySql 5.1.50

My main server which hosts the profiles module runs dual optron 6186
processors and has 8 gigs of ram
All the modules work perfectly with as I have said with one anomaly
No problems with the 7.1.1 version and the 7.3 DEV version

However with the 7.2 release the profiles module acts problematically
It seem Picks will load and my notes seem to work
Also the web page I have placed in to the profile will load correctly
However Interests and Avatar Information doesn't seem to load

I know if I put information in them and click ok and then open on a sim
running 7.1.1 the information I placed there in the 7.2 sim shows up
The Avatar information also shows the avatar as being Born 1/1/1970(15307
Days Old)

I'm running a grid configuration with the main sim's accessing the MySql for
region data
The other connections to the grid are using sql lite for region data as I
still haven't figured how to connect to mysql from another computer
OS Grid seem to use this configuration

The remote grid connection I am testing out is being run from my laptop
connected to a modem with direct access to the internet

I hope this information will be helpful

now that more people are testing the modules, i think it's a perfect
time to start collecting error vs environment information.  i realize
that the mantis holds pages and pages of error documentation, but now
that there is a constant value (everyone is using the same module
code/versions) it should be easier to compare and contrast the other
variables.  in my documentation i listed the specific conditions under
which i had success (i.e. platform, OS version, mono/sql/php versions)
so those having errors should include the same data here (or in emails
for those who are contacting me directly) and treat it like a smaller,
more informal mantis.  this will also help to create better 'contingency
documentation' for future wiki updates or tutorials.

as for the profiles issue Chris mentioned, i wasn't able to re-create
the problem, though i do remember experiencing it before.  unfortunately
i can't recall the specific circumstances under which it occurred :/
were there any error messages in the console?

there has also been a recent update to the search module and i believe
one pending for the profile as well.  for bundle fans, i'll be posting
an updated download soon.

best to all.
