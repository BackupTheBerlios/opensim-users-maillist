<PRE>now that more people are testing the modules, i think it's a perfect 
time to start collecting error vs environment information.  i realize 
that the mantis holds pages and pages of error documentation, but now 
that there is a constant value (everyone is using the same module 
code/versions) it should be easier to compare and contrast the other 
variables.  in my documentation i listed the specific conditions under 
which i had success (i.e. platform, OS version, mono/sql/php versions) 
so those having errors should include the same data here (or in emails 
for those who are contacting me directly) and treat it like a smaller, 
more informal mantis.  this will also help to create better 'contingency 
documentation' for future wiki updates or tutorials.

as for the profiles issue Chris mentioned, i wasn't able to re-create 
the problem, though i do remember experiencing it before.  unfortunately 
i can't recall the specific circumstances under which it occurred :/  
were there any error messages in the console?

there has also been a recent update to the search module and i believe 
one pending for the profile as well.  for bundle fans, i'll be posting 
an updated download soon.

best to all.
