Not much is clear from the log.

To be honest, I recommend asking in the osgrid forums if you're connecting to osgrid.  They're going to have experience 
of working around these issues.

&gt;<i> -------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> Original email
</I>&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> I recently found out about having multiple regions within the same
</I>&gt;<i> server and I'm having some interesting issues.
</I>&gt;<i> 1) I cannot walk between the regions. As soon as I hit the border, I
</I>&gt;<i> stop and the server starts throwing out stuff. I cannot tell what seems
</I>&gt;<i> to be the problem from the messages, so I thought I'd attach my log file
</I>&gt;<i> in case it helps someone.
</I>&gt;<i> The log file should show the server coming up. I then log on as Damon
</I>&gt;<i> Hindermann into DamonWorld. I walk over to the edge and try to cross
</I>&gt;<i> into DarkWorld. I get stuck, wait a bit, and then quit. I hope that
</I>&gt;<i> makes sense so the log then makes sense.
</I>&gt;<i> I do have a unique UUID for each region. I am also putting my Avatar
</I>&gt;<i> UUID in as well. Each region has its own port and I've tested that the
</I>&gt;<i> ports are open.
</I>&gt;<i> I also cannot see the regions from where I am, but they show in the mini
</I>&gt;<i> and regular maps.
</I>&gt;<i> 2) I cannot TP to another region. But, I can TP to Wright Plaza and then
</I>&gt;<i> to one of my other regions. Maybe this is related to issue 1.
</I>&gt;<i> 3) I thought that I could set the environment for each sim independently
</I>&gt;<i> so that I could have one region that was always night and the others
</I>&gt;<i> follow a normal sunlight cycle. However, changing it in one region
</I>&gt;<i> changed it for all the regions.
</I>&gt;<i> 4) What is the difference between a Region and an Estate? I'm seeing
</I>&gt;<i> both being thrown around almost as if they mean the same thing.
</I>&gt;<i> -Damon
