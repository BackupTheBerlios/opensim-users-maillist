<PRE>Hi there,

As I could not find anything about this topic on google I'd like to post 
my question here.

OpenSim gives us the opportunity to model complete landscapes spread 
over several regions.
And many ppl do so as cost for one or more regions is substantially 
lower as in Second Life.

Prerequisites:
- Setting view distance of viewer (Imprudence used) to 512 meters

First test in Second Life (Mainland):
- Can view 512 meters - meaning about 3 regions far:
   1st region: the one I am currently in
   2nd region: the direct neighbour region
   3rd region: the region behind the neighbor (can view only partly / 
512 meters)

Second test in OSGrid (same client / viewer, same configuration as above):
- Can only view 2 regions far:
   1st region: the one I am currently in
   2nd region: the direct neighbour region
- not depending on the region being hosted on the same sim or not (same 
behaviour)

Can this behaviour be changed by tweaking some (server side) configuration?
If not, is it planned to increase the viewing distance to more than one 
region in the neighbourhood?

Thanks and greetings to everyone ;-)
jabbaah / Stefan
