<PRE>I noticed a few big differences as soon as I unzipped the files and 
needed to know what do I need to do to be sure I don't loose anything as 
far as my regions and data goes.  I STANDALONE.  I want to move on past 
OSGRID's version STANDALONE and get up to the new 0.7 STANDALONE.

One thing I noticed was a different directory structure with the bin 
directory in the folder opensim-0.7-rc2, and not just a bin folder.  And 
a non exsitant Regions folder.  In OSgrid I used to have to take the 
estate_settings.xml from the old version and move it into the new bin 
folder of the new version.  Do I still do that?

Oh and I use the Regions folders with a name of region .ini file for 
each.  Do I copy the entire Regions folder from my old 0.6.9 post fixes 
and take them over to the new opensim-0.7-rc2/bin and place it in there, 
or will this mess it all up?

I have heard some place about issues with making oar files in 0.6.9 and 
trying to get 0.7 to load them.  I am a bit worried I will make the move 
and loose everything I have built so far.  Am I on the right track?  Of 
course I always back up mysql database. I am worried a bit about the oar 
files.  thank you for any advice coming from the OSGrid release to the 
new 0.7 version.

Best regards,
InuYasha.
