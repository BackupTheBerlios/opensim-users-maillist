<PRE>I don't have a lot of experience with porting MySql between different OSes,
but general &quot;belt and suspenders&quot; considerations says that a second and
independent path would be a very good &quot;safety net&quot;.

I would definitely suggest making an IAR backup of every user inventory and
an OAR backup of every region! In that way you have a totally separate way
to transfer the data and at least the opportunity to recover anything which
is corrupted or lost in the transfer!

I believe there are tutorials on how to automate these backups although I
have not personally tried them. If you have more that 2 or 3 users and/or 2
or 3 regions then this will significantly reduce the workload.

It pays to be VER conservative (careful) in making backups since if
information is LOST it can be extremely hard to re-create, finding something
in multiple backups is trivial compared to re-creating content!

remember: Jesus saves - EARLY AND OFTEN!

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The reason I ask is: I have successfully been able to restore my Windows

</I>&gt;<i> that says &quot;Object Type not recognized&quot; (or it might have said Object Type
</I>&gt;<i> not Found, I don't remember off the top of my head) and the restore fails.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In a nutshell, is it safe to port my backups between different operating

</I>&gt;<i> my inventory(s)? I always make both OAR/IAR and SQL dump backups just to be
</I>&gt;<i> safe, but I would like to know.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any suggestions and/or tips would be much appreciated! =)
