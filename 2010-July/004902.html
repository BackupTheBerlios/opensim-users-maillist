<PRE>Thank you SO much for taking the time to explain it to me =) I sincerely 
appreciate it!
It has put my mind at ease about cross platform backups now... I was 
always worried I'd lose the stuff that I have worked long hours to put 
together on OpenSim by cross platform backups. I will continue to keep 
multiple backups though, mainly several &quot;generations&quot; of SQL dumps and 
OAR/IAR's , just to err on the side of caution. Thanks for the heads up 
on OS 0.7.x as well =)

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the case of MySql you are essentially running the same software in 
</I>&gt;<i> different environments  - both the basic database server and the Admin 
</I>&gt;<i> tools - so I would expect any major issues to be a very rare things.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Probably the best assurance of this is the MySql &quot;market share&quot;, it is 
</I>&gt;<i> one of the most popular database systems in existence and is used in 
</I>&gt;<i> all kinds of environments (OS, hardware, networks, etc.) from simple 
</I>&gt;<i> standalone setups to massive distributed corporate &quot;enterprise&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> systems. As a result I would expect that any common problems would be 
</I>&gt;<i> found and fixed very rapidly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The kind of data loss caused by parts of a file being deleted could 
</I>&gt;<i> certainly occur, but there are very well known and widely used methods 
</I>&gt;<i> to detect and fix this kind of problem. My recollection is that the 
</I>&gt;<i> SQL &quot;backups&quot; from MySql have several built in mechanisms to check this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Loss of some more subtle information such as a pointer to a specific 
</I>&gt;<i> texture (or your other examples) is more likely, however the 
</I>&gt;<i> application software would (SHOULD!) be the same version of OpenSim in 
</I>&gt;<i> both cases so this too is very unlikely. This however is a distinct 
</I>&gt;<i> possibility when upgrading from one version to the next regardless of 
</I>&gt;<i> the OS!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since there are extensive changes made to the internal workings of 
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim between V0.6.9 and V0.7.xx this becomes very plausible. It is 
</I>&gt;<i> the subject of a lot of the testing work being done on the current RCs 
</I>&gt;<i> as a result. Again I would expect that by the time V0.7 is released 
</I>&gt;<i> the major problems either fixed or well known.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All the same any grid that has more than a half dozen users will 
</I>&gt;<i> likely implement its own beta testing program to catch these problems 
</I>&gt;<i> in your specific environment. There always do seem to be a few issues 
</I>&gt;<i> brought to light in these tests! Not a problem if you only need to fix 
</I>&gt;<i> up two or three users (or regions) but if say 5000 users have their 
</I>&gt;<i> inventory corrupted then you have a major problem!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As always &quot;slow and easy wins the race&quot; and a well planned step by 
</I>&gt;<i> step migration is essential.

</I>&gt;<i>     or if data loss would be a &quot;freak&quot; kind of thing (i.e. a bug in
</I>&gt;<i>     the My SQL server or MySQL Admin when it comes to Linux or
</I>&gt;<i>     Windows, or configuration differences between the default setup of
</I>&gt;<i>     the MySQL server on Linux vs. Windows, etc).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Would it be a noticeable thing if data loss did occur such as
</I>&gt;<i>     missing inventory, or something more subtle that would take a bit
</I>&gt;<i>     of digging to find; such as missing textures or even &quot;blank&quot; data
</I>&gt;<i>     (i.e. open a texture and all you see is a white box where the
</I>&gt;<i>     texture should have been. Or try to play an animation / sound from
</I>&gt;<i>     your inventory and it won't play)?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Thank you very much for the suggestions! =)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     I would definitely suggest making an IAR backup of every user

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     I believe there are tutorials on how to automate these backups

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     2 or 3 users and/or 2 or 3 regions then this will significantly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     reduce the workload.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     It pays to be VER conservative (careful) in making backups since

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         Hi, I want to migrate my OpenSim MySQL database from Linux to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         Windows and vice versa (for traveling reasons) using the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         MySQL Admin's SQL dump ( MySQL Admin Backup) feature.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         Is there anything special that I need to know or to look out
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         for when doing this (besides making sure Max Packet Size is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         set to 16 MB on the target system)?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         The way I normally do my database backup in the Linux
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         environment is to shut down the OpenSim server, go to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         backup tool in MySQL Admin, create a backup project (if it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         doesn't already exist) for my OpenSim schema making sure all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         the tables are selected for backup. Then I go into advanced
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         options and click on Normal Backup, and check Complete Backup
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         and run the backup to save my database to a .sql file. This
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         method has worked perfectly fine for me under Linux with no
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         data loss after a restore from backup that I can tell. I have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         even restored my database to a Windows environment from a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         Linux created MySQL dump file with no problems that I can see.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         My concern is creating a database backup in a Windows
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         environment and then restoring it to Linux (or even another
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         Windows environment). Would this, under normal circumstances,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         cause data loss?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         The reason I ask is: I have successfully been able to restore
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         my Windows created SQL dump file to Linux and other Windows
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         systems running XP... But the moment I try to restore my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         database to a Windows 7 system I get an error that says
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         &quot;Object Type not recognized&quot; (or it might have said Object
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         Type not Found, I don't remember off the top of my head) and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         the restore fails.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         In a nutshell, is it safe to port my backups between
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         different operating systems like this? Or am I better off
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         creating OARs of my regions and IAR of my inventory(s)? I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         always make both OAR/IAR and SQL dump backups just to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         safe, but I would like to know.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         Any suggestions and/or tips would be much appreciated! =)
