As far as I can see, no log is attached.

I recommend that you try setting up a standalone and seeing if you have trouble crossing between regions on that.

Trying to cross between regions hosted on different machines is, of course, a somewhat different matter.  Success will 
depend heavily on the network connection quality of the two hosts (and the client).

&gt;<i> 3) I thought that I could set the environment for each sim independently
</I>&gt;<i> so that I could have one region that was always night and the others
</I>&gt;<i> follow a normal sunlight cycle. However, changing it in one region
</I>&gt;<i> changed it for all the regions.
</I>
Yes, I think there are bugs in this area.

&gt;<i> 4) What is the difference between a Region and an Estate? I'm seeing
</I>&gt;<i> both being thrown around almost as if they mean the same thing.
</I>
afaik, an estate can consist of many regions.  Each region can belong only to one estate.
