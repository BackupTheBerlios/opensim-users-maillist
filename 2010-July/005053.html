Are they actually marked phantom or just behaving that way?

If they're not marked then it might be related to this issue

The mantis is assigned to me but I haven't had a chance to look further into it and might still not for some time.  So 
if anybody else wants to fix it please feel free.

I believe there are still quite a few bugs relating to linked objects - you might have got unlucky.

You could try to restore the object by saving it to inventory and re-rezzing it in the old OpenSim version, or perhaps 
by saving it to an IAR in the old version and loading it back into the new.
