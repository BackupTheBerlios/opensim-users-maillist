Yes, I believe Freeswitch is standard SIP along with H.323 call 
initiation perhaps.  I can say that when we opened our network 
boundary firewall for Freeswitch use externally it was all standard 
ports of this type.  So I would imagine any suitable VoIP server 
would be able to be used in Opensim with appropriate module in the 
server side, without any client change at all.

I can confirm from our own tests that Freeswitch works fine with out 
of the box SL Viewers (1.23.5 and 2.1) and with lightweight non-3D 
client that supports voice such as the Radegast Metaverse Client.
