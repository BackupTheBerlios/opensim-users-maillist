<PRE>Hi - reposting this from opensim-dev as I realised this was a better forum
  When trying to upgrade my 0.6.9 standalone region to 0.7 I hit a problem.
 My 0.6.9 was a straight forward single region stand-alone install on Vista
64-bit, just modified config to use MySQL.  Just two users one of which was
the 'master user' (estate manager). To upgrade I modified opensim.ini and
config-include/StandaloneCommon.ini to enable MySQL and ran
OpenSim.32BitLaunch.exe - entered the name of the 0.6.9 region, and also
entered the name of the 0.6.9 master user as the estate manager.  All seemed
well.  However, I am then unable to log either of the users in - I get
'Login failed, unable to retrieve user inventory' in the console and 'The
inventory service is not responding' in the client. I can create new users,
and they log in fine.  Since I had a DB backup I was able to revert to
0.6.9, create OAR and IARs and get 0.7 up and running that way, but I'm
wondering - did I miss a step with the upgrade process?

Thanks
Neil Canham
