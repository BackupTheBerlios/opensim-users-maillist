<PRE>I believe this has come up in the mailing lists before, but I cannot 
pin down the correct way this should be handled....

I create a region using create-region at the Opensim.exe console and 
the region seems to be voice enabled by default (1 in the 
&quot;estate_settings&quot; table &quot;AllowVoice&quot; field), and it shows as enabled 
in the Viewer World -&gt; Estate/Region media tab fine.

But when we log on via SL Viewer 1.23.5 the parcel shows at the top 
an icon that the hover tip say &quot;Voice is not enabled&quot;.   If we look 
at the parcel &quot;About Land&quot; Media tab the option to turn voice on and 
off is greyed out, unticked and says &quot;Enable Voice (established by 
the estate)&quot;.

As I recall something about this only benign able to be set in older 
SL Viewers, I installed an old SL Viewer (1.19) and was able to see 
that it thought the parcel voice settings were &quot;Disable spatial audio 
on this parcel&quot;. In that old viewer I could alter that to &quot;Use the 
Estate Spatial channel&quot;, and then the top icon indicating &quot;Voice is 
not enabled&quot; goes away.  It altered the &quot;land&quot; table &quot;LandFlags&quot; 
setting in the MySQL database.

------
How is this meant to work in Opensim?  It seems that all parcels have 
their Voice setting as off even if the whole region/estate they are 
in has that on.  And the fact there is no way to alter this in recent 
SL viewers makes it awkward to alter things unless you manually amend 
the LandFlags setting in the data base.  A sensible default for all 
plots would seem to be to enable the voice so it works if the 
region/estate allows voice?

By the way, I did see the Opensim.ini [RemoteAdmin] section setting 
for create_region_enable_voice, and I set that to true, created a 
region and looked at the plot, etc, but the voice is still disabled 
on the parcel.  So this seeting, as it says must only apply if you 
create a region via RemoteAdmin and not at the Opensim.exe console.

     ; set this variable to true if you want the create_region XmlRpc
     ; call to unconditionally enable voice on all parcels for a newly
     ; created region [default: false]

     create_region_enable_voice = true

------
Is there a way to make the default for parcels to have voice on if 
the region has voice on?

What is the recommend way to turn on parcel voice if its off in all 
the parcels in an Opensim data base at present?
