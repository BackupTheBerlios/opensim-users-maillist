<PRE>My experience is with Engineering or design type databases rather than
commercial/SQL type of databases, however the concept of data integrity is
so fundamental that I would be very surprised if much would happen without
being noticed!

In the case of MySql you are essentially running the same software in
different environments  - both the basic database server and the Admin tools
- so I would expect any major issues to be a very rare things.

Probably the best assurance of this is the MySql &quot;market share&quot;, it is one
of the most popular database systems in existence and is used in all kinds
of environments (OS, hardware, networks, etc.) from simple standalone setups
to massive distributed corporate &quot;enterprise&quot; systems. As a result I would
expect that any common problems would be found and fixed very rapidly.

The kind of data loss caused by parts of a file being deleted could
certainly occur, but there are very well known and widely used methods to
detect and fix this kind of problem. My recollection is that the SQL
&quot;backups&quot; from MySql have several built in mechanisms to check this.

Loss of some more subtle information such as a pointer to a specific texture
(or your other examples) is more likely, however the application software
would (SHOULD!) be the same version of OpenSim in both cases so this too is
very unlikely. This however is a distinct possibility when upgrading from
one version to the next regardless of the OS!

Since there are extensive changes made to the internal workings of OpenSim
between V0.6.9 and V0.7.xx this becomes very plausible. It is the subject of
a lot of the testing work being done on the current RCs as a result. Again I
would expect that by the time V0.7 is released the major problems either
fixed or well known.

All the same any grid that has more than a half dozen users will likely
implement its own beta testing program to catch these problems in your
specific environment. There always do seem to be a few issues brought to
light in these tests! Not a problem if you only need to fix up two or three
users (or regions) but if say 5000 users have their inventory corrupted then
you have a major problem!

As always &quot;slow and easy wins the race&quot; and a well planned step by step
migration is essential.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The way I normally do my database backup in the Linux environment is to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> shut down the OpenSim server, go to the backup tool in MySQL Admin, create a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> backup project (if it doesn't already exist) for my OpenSim schema making
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sure all the tables are selected for backup. Then I go into advanced options
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and click on Normal Backup, and check Complete Backup and run the backup to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> save my database to a .sql file. This method has worked perfectly fine for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> me under Linux with no data loss after a restore from backup that I can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tell. I have even restored my database to a Windows environment from a Linux
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> created MySQL dump file with no problems that I can see.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My concern is creating a database backup in a Windows environment and then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> restoring it to Linux (or even another Windows environment). Would this,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> under normal circumstances, cause data loss?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The reason I ask is: I have successfully been able to restore my Windows
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> created SQL dump file to Linux and other Windows systems running XP... But
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the moment I try to restore my database to a Windows 7 system I get an error
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that says &quot;Object Type not recognized&quot; (or it might have said Object Type
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not Found, I don't remember off the top of my head) and the restore fails.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In a nutshell, is it safe to port my backups between different operating
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> systems like this? Or am I better off creating OARs of my regions and IAR of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> my inventory(s)? I always make both OAR/IAR and SQL dump backups just to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> safe, but I would like to know.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Any suggestions and/or tips would be much appreciated! =)
