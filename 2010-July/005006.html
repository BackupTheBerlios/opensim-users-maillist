<PRE>Hi,
 
I recently found out about having multiple regions within the same server
and I'm having some interesting issues.
 
1) I cannot walk between the regions.  As soon as I hit the border, I stop
and the server starts throwing out stuff.  I cannot tell what seems to be
the problem from the messages, so I thought I'd attach my log file in case
it helps someone.
 
The log file should show the server coming up.  I then log on as Damon
Hindermann into DamonWorld.  I walk over to the edge and try to cross into
DarkWorld.  I get stuck, wait a bit, and then quit.  I hope that makes sense
so the log then makes sense.
 
I do have a unique UUID for each region.  I am also putting my Avatar UUID
in as well.  Each region has its own port and I've tested that the ports are
open.
I also cannot see the regions from where I am, but they show in the mini and
regular maps.
 
2)  I cannot TP to another region.  But, I can TP to Wright Plaza and then
to one of my other regions.  Maybe this is related to issue 1.
 
3) I thought that I could set the environment for each sim independently so
that I could have one region that was always night and the others follow a
normal sunlight cycle.  However, changing it in one region changed it for
all the regions.
 
4) What is the difference between a Region and an Estate?  I'm seeing both
being thrown around almost as if they mean the same thing.
