Attempted the dmz  with both hostname and the current dynamic IP# but
neither resulted in any success with HG

No, standard port forwarding on an asus router flashed with recent dd-wrt
firmware. Never a loopback issue with any 6.9 region i have setup and run.

I have been posting these questions in the 
<A HREF="http://opensim-users.2152040.n2.nabble.com/">http://opensim-users.2152040.n2.nabble.com/</A> forums having assumed it is
there to get help from other opensim users. If you want debug messages then
tell me where to find them and i will provide what I can. I don't have an
account on the   <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view_all_bug_page.php">http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view_all_bug_page.php</A>
Bugs-R-Us   section and wouldn't have a clue how to submit anyway. Never
mind the time of rehashing what I have already written.

I really don't think anymore that the issue is with my network or
configuration. Haven't had problems running any other region setup including
the last 3 of your distributions out of the box. And there are at least 2
people here with a lot more knowledge then I, who haven't been successful
with the standalone hypergrid with sqlite setup.
 


Here is a log of a couple HG jump attempts in case that provides any clues.
