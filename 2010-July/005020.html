<PRE>OK, this time the log is attached.  I was sure I did it.
 
For those that have already provided some answers/questions, thanks!  I'm
using Hippo Viewer.
The 4 regions are all within the same server on the same PC.  I used to just
have DamonWorld and it worked fine.
I first tried by putting all the regions in the same RegionConfig.ini.  I
thought maybe breaking them out was worth a try so now all the regions have
their own .ini files in the Regions subdirectory.
 
I am having loopback issues with my router and so I connect to my regions
through my neighbor's wireless.  Is it possible that since the loopback is
not working, it is creating the region crossing issue and maybe the TP to my
other regions?

Hi,
 
I recently found out about having multiple regions within the same server
and I'm having some interesting issues.
 
1) I cannot walk between the regions.  As soon as I hit the border, I stop
and the server starts throwing out stuff.  I cannot tell what seems to be
the problem from the messages, so I thought I'd attach my log file in case
it helps someone.
 
The log file should show the server coming up.  I then log on as Damon
Hindermann into DamonWorld.  I walk over to the edge and try to cross into
DarkWorld.  I get stuck, wait a bit, and then quit.  I hope that makes sense
so the log then makes sense.
 
I do have a unique UUID for each region.  I am also putting my Avatar UUID
in as well.  Each region has its own port and I've tested that the ports are
open.
I also cannot see the regions from where I am, but they show in the mini and
regular maps.
 
2)  I cannot TP to another region.  But, I can TP to Wright Plaza and then
to one of my other regions.  Maybe this is related to issue 1.
 
3) I thought that I could set the environment for each sim independently so
that I could have one region that was always night and the others follow a
normal sunlight cycle.  However, changing it in one region changed it for
all the regions.
 
4) What is the difference between a Region and an Estate?  I'm seeing both
being thrown around almost as if they mean the same thing.
