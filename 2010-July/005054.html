<PRE>Hi

Thanks for the prompt feedback :)

1) I've solved the problem with the phantom objects. The objects were
not marked as phantom, but were behaving as phantom. During the
upgrade, in editing OpenSim.ini I has set CombineContiguousRegions =
false, whereas before the upgrade this had been set to true. Setting
this parameter back to true and restarting the simulator solved the
problem and the objects are no longer phantom :)

2) Some of the linked objects originally imported from SL have now
reappeared, some appear occasionally after a simulator restart/client
cache clear, and some are invisible/uneditable but can't be walked
through!

I have found comment stripping invaluable in getting a manageable
version of OpenSim.ini. Can I please put in a plea? When future
releases of OpenSim come out and someone creates OpenSim.ini.example
can they please put all ; delimited comments on a separate line and
also remove any unnecessary semi-colons?

Lines such as

http_listener_ssl_cert = &quot;&quot; ; Currently unused, but will be used for
OSHttpServer
enabled = true;

make using grep -v &quot;;&quot; much harder to use for comment stripping ;)

Thanks everyone

Clive

Are they actually marked phantom or just behaving that way?

If they're not marked then it might be related to this issue

The mantis is assigned to me but I haven't had a chance to look
further into it and might still not for some time.  So
if anybody else wants to fix it please feel free.

I believe there are still quite a few bugs relating to linked objects
- you might have got unlucky.

You could try to restore the object by saving it to inventory and
re-rezzing it in the old OpenSim version, or perhaps
by saving it to an IAR in the old version and loading it back into the new.
