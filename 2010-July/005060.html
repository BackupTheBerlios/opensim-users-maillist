As far as I know, there are a few reports about issues with upgrading user accounts from 0.6.x to 0.7. You may find the discussion in Mantis #4875 (<A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=4875">http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=4875</A>) interesting where a routine is described for forcing the update of user accounts. Basically, it consists of manually resetting the &quot;Migrations&quot; table entries for &quot;UserAccount&quot; or &quot;AuthStore&quot;, removing those tables and thus forcing OpenSim to rebuild the new tables from the old &quot;users&quot; table on startup. If you want to try this, then make sure to only reset one table between restarts of OpenSim and never both at the same time.
