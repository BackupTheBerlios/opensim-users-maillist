Ah okay... news to me too.. did not spot that on opensim-dev or 
opensim-users.  It works fine in fact and its in widespread use on 
live grids.  We just got our Freeswitch services going with a bit of 
concentrated effort and help from other Opensim Freeswitch users 
after resolving a number of issues mostly through confusing or 
limited context configuration instructions.

So, the question is what is to be the voice solution or solutions 
that can be recommended for Opensim and that we might be able to use 
in future, as voice is clearly an essential feature?

I know others have set up Vivox which provides high causality voice 
facilities... but I have not investigated what the costs would be, or 
more realistically for man Opensim community userrs, if there is a 
non-commercial offering that can be used via Vivox?

I wonder if another open source and high quality voice solution 
should be the bass from people's experience?  opensim-users may be 
the better place to discuss that as the user base there might be 
wider than opensim-dev... hence also posted to that list. Suggest a 
rely to users only please as most dev folks see users too.
