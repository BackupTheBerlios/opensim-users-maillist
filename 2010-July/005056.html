</I>&gt;<i> 1) I've solved the problem with the phantom objects. The objects were

</I>&gt;<i> 2) Some of the linked objects originally imported from SL have now

</I>
If an object has turned invisible but can't be walked through then this suggests that the object information has got 
lost between the server and the client.  This is usually due to network bandwidth issues though it may also only show up 
after a configuration/version change.  Symptoms are that objects reappear on relogs and disappearance is not consistent. 
  The chief solution is to reduce network bandwidth usage in the viewer settings.

I'm surprised if this problem is showing up on a LAN though.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have found comment stripping invaluable in getting a manageable
</I>&gt;<i> version of OpenSim.ini. Can I please put in a plea? When future
</I>&gt;<i> releases of OpenSim come out and someone creates OpenSim.ini.example
</I>&gt;<i> can they please put all ; delimited comments on a separate line and
</I>&gt;<i> also remove any unnecessary semi-colons?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Lines such as
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> http_listener_ssl_cert = &quot;&quot; ; Currently unused, but will be used for
</I>&gt;<i> OSHttpServer
</I>&gt;<i> enabled = true;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> make using grep -v &quot;;&quot; much harder to use for comment stripping ;)
</I>
You need to use a regex more like grep -ve &quot;^\s*;&quot; or something :), as Robert suggested.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2) Also any ideas why another set of linked objects originally

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> them and I cannot edit them, but at the same time I cannot walk
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> through where they used to be either as something is getting in my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> way!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe there are still quite a few bugs relating to linked objects
</I>&gt;<i> - you might have got unlucky.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You could try to restore the object by saving it to inventory and
</I>&gt;<i> re-rezzing it in the old OpenSim version, or perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> by saving it to an IAR in the old version and loading it back into the new.
