<PRE>If an object is made up of many pieces, all of which are the same mesh,
then it would be better to upload the mesh once and just duplicate it. This
is because the mesh is a single asset and the viewer *should* only download
it once. However, each piece is still a single &quot;prim&quot; whether it's a prim,
a sculpt, or a mesh, and will still require a message from the sim
(ObjectUpdate packet) telling the viewer that it is there. This message is
quite small compared to the size of the mesh asset though and many of them
can be sent quite quickly. If the same mesh was uploaded many times and
these different uploads were used in the same scene, then each mesh would
get a different Asset ID and the viewers would have no way of knowing they
were all the same and would need to download each copy separately; this
could put quite a strain on the simulator and the network and should be
avoided.

Note that in Second Life, &quot;Land Impact&quot; may be adversely influenced by many
copies of the same mesh *even though the mesh only has to be sent to each
viewer once*. This is an oversight in the design of Land Impact and
OpenSimulator does not have this issue as it does not implement Land Impact.
