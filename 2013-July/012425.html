<PRE>re : &quot;The various editors I tried require a lot of gymnastics just to get
objects that render well in them to be imported into opensim.
I am only familiar with ac3d, and Blender somewhat.&quot;

I've been working with Blender 2.6, and while I'll admit it takes a bit 
of adjusting if you're moving from prim based modeling it works 
perfectly with opensim uploading through either Firestorm or Kokua.  
Scaling is a bit of a headache but after upload my models show exactly 
as they did in Blender and oddly enough, they seem to actually load a 
bit faster.

While on the topic of mesh, I did have a quick question to anyone out 
there regarding instancing.  Awhile back (before the advent of mesh) I 
seem to remember someone mentioning that sculpts were superior to normal 
prims as only one copy of the sculpt is downloaded and then applied to 
all objects it was used on by the viewer.  Would anyone happen to know 
if the same holds true for mesh?  Say in the case of an model with 
multiple duplicated pieces, would it make better sense to include one 
copy of the duplicate piece in the dae and then duplicate it in world or 
just glob it all together during the import?

Thanks, :)
