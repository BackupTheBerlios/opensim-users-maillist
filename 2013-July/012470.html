<PRE>The login service does require access to a lot of other services but I didn't think it would be necessary to actually 
have connectors for them active.

In your separate login service config, do you still have a section like

[LoginService]
; for the server connector
LocalServiceModule = OpenSim.Services.LLLoginService.dll:LLLoginService
; for the service
UserAccountService = OpenSim.Services.UserAccountService.dll:UserAccountService
GridUserService = OpenSim.Services.UserAccountService.dll:GridUserService
AuthenticationService = OpenSim.Services.AuthenticationService.dll:PasswordAuthenticationService
InventoryService = OpenSim.Services.InventoryService.dll:XInventoryService
AvatarService = OpenSim.Services.AvatarService.dll:AvatarService
PresenceService = OpenSim.Services.PresenceService.dll:PresenceService
GridService = OpenSim.Services.Connectors.dll:GridServicesConnector
SimulationService = OpenSim.Services.Connectors.dll:SimulationServiceConnector
LibraryService = OpenSim.Services.InventoryService.dll:LibraryService
UserAgentService = OpenSim.Services.HypergridService.dll:UserAgentService
FriendsService = OpenSim.Services.FriendsService.dll:FriendsService

?  I believe this is the part that sets up internal services for the login service to access all the other bits of 
OpenSimulator that it needs.  These internal services still need to connect to the database but do not have external 
connectors if they are not set up in the [Startup] section.

It's also possible that there bugs and this is not working as it should.  Is it just adding the connectors back to 
ServiceList (master only, I think) or ServiceConnectors (OpenSimulator 0.7.5 and earlier) that makes this work again?
