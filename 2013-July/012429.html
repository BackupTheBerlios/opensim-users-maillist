<PRE>Dr. Ramloll,

You would probably get a better benefit if you were to upload a few 
different variations.  For example: a single plant, a 10x10 patch of 
joined plants, a 20x20 patch, and so on.  Each of the three variations 
if duplicated in world would only be downloaded once and you would have 
the flexibility to cover a variety of different areas in different sizes 
more efficiently.

In regard to prim counts, if you were to upload a single plant and then 
build your patch in world you would likely be using far more prims than 
you would if you uploaded a pre-joined patch.  So, not counting for 
vertex counts and all the other goodies that come from a land impact 
calculation - the following would hold true.

1 plant    = 1 prim     = 1 mesh download, 1 object download
10 plants (linked in world) = 10 prims = 1 mesh download, 10 object 
downloads
10 linked plant patches = 100 prims = 1 mesh download, 100 object downloads
1 patch (10 plants joined in mesh before import) = 1 prim = 1 mesh 
download, 1 object download
10 mesh patches = 10 prims = 1 mesh download, 10 object downloads

The theory being that the mesh download is much larger than the object 
download.  The mesh download contains the mesh's geometry, textures, 
texture maps, and so on wherein the object download contains such things 
as the object's position in world, the id of the mesh, textures, and so 
on that are applied to it.

I hope this helps.  :)
