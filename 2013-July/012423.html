<PRE>Hello
I am wondering if this is documented somewhere, I try googling but
could not find the info.
What is the current version of collada expected by Firestorm or Second
Life viewer?
I am not familiar with console commands for opensim but I imagine
there much be commands to load collada files manually (?), in any
case, what version of collada does opensim expect its collada objs to
be in.
The amount of effort to get anything to work from static objects to
rigged avatars is really out of bounds.
The various editors I tried require a lot of gymnastics just to get
objects that render well in them to be imported into opensim.
I am only familiar with ac3d, and Blender somewhat. Since we are on
this topic, is there really a human usable 3d editor that actually
works with little headaches.
Blender is in a class of its own ... with its different versions and
lack of back compatibility.
Any way, will wait for some of your thoughts and insights.
R
