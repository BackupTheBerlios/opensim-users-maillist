<PRE>Hi folks,


We are planning a large-scale load test of the OpenSimulator Community
Conference grid on Tuesday, July 2, 2013 at Noon PDT and we need members of
the community to help push the conference grid to its limits to test the
capacity and performance of the simulator software and hardware.

Anyone interested in the conference or the OpenSimulator software is
welcome to participate in the load test by making a jump from any other
hypergrid enabled OpenSimulator grid.  The focus of this load test will be
fitting as many hypergrid participants on the keynote regions of the
conference grid as possible.

The OpenSimulator Community Conference grid is located in the 7000,7000
coordinate range, and the four keynote regions we&#8217;ll be testing are:

cc.opensimulator.org:8002:Keynote 1

cc.opensimulator.org:8002:Keynote 2

cc.opensimulator.org:8002:Keynote 3

cc.opensimulator.org:8002:Keynote 4

If you find that the first region you try is full please use the next
address on the list and so on.

For the purposes of this load test, feel free to log in with multiple
avatars, but please do not use bots, pcampbots, or other various libomv
based viewers since we are trying to test the conference grid under
conditions as close to the actual conference as possible.  We recommend a
Third Party Viewer that can support voice and mesh, such as Singularity,
Firestorm, or Kokua.

Instructions if you already have a Hypergrid enabled account

If you already have an account on another OpenSimulator grid that is
hypergrid enabled, here are the steps to participate in the load test on
Tuesday:

1.  Log into your account on your hypergrid enabled grid.

2.  If necessary, navigate to a jump region that can reach a destination in
the 7000,7000 coordinate range.  OSGrid provides public jump regions for
this purpose, see the list at <A HREF="http://www.osgrid.org/index.php/hypergrid.">http://www.osgrid.org/index.php/hypergrid.</A>

3.  Open your map and search for one of the following destination regions:

cc.opensimulator.org:8002:Keynote 1

cc.opensimulator.org:8002:Keynote 2

cc.opensimulator.org:8002:Keynote 3

cc.opensimulator.org:8002:Keynote 4

4.  The map search should locate the destination region on the map, then
click the Teleport button.  If you find that the first region you try is
full please use the next address on the list and so on.

Instructions if you need a Hypergrid enabled account

If you don&#8217;t already have an account on another OpenSimulator grid that is
hypergrid enabled, here are the steps to participate in the load test on
Tuesday:

1.  Create an account on OSGrid at
<A HREF="http://www.osgrid.org/index.php/auth/register.">http://www.osgrid.org/index.php/auth/register.</A>

2.  Download a TPV viewer supported by OSGrid from
<A HREF="http://www.osgrid.org/index.php/downloads">http://www.osgrid.org/index.php/downloads</A> and log into your account.

3.  Open your map and search for one of the following destination regions:

cc.opensimulator.org:8002:Keynote 1

cc.opensimulator.org:8002:Keynote 2

cc.opensimulator.org:8002:Keynote 3

cc.opensimulator.org:8002:Keynote 4

4.  The map search should locate the destination region on the map, then
click the Teleport button.  If you find that the first region you try is
full please use the next address on the list and so on.

Thanks in advance for your help and we look forward to seeing a big crowd
on Tuesday!
