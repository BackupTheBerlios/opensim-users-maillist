<PRE>Thanks for the links, I've tried for hours to get this to work 
correctly..... but have failed.
I have an instance of MySQL running on one machine with an instance of 
robust.exe running there with only the inventory services connector 
initialized using port 8005.... started and running fine. Firewall is 
open on that port as well.

I have a second machine which is running all other robust.ini service 
connectors with default ports except for inventory and freeswitch(I am 
not using this
). This robust instance starts with no errors. Firewall is open on all 
of these ports as well.

I have a 3rd machine which is running a simulator instance where 
gridcommon.ini points it to the first machine/port for the inventory and 
second machine for all other robust services.
This region simulator starts up with no errors.

Using the 2nd machine/robust instance I am able to create an avatar and 
everything seems fine... no errors, but upon trying to login to the 
&quot;Grid&quot; I am unable to connect.
I get a failure; &quot;The inventory service is not responding. Please notify 
your login region operator&quot;.

When I check the robust instance on the 2nd machine, there is a message; 
Login Failed Reason: Inventory Service Not Set up.

When I allow the 2nd machine to handle all robust services and point my 
gridcommon.ini to that machine for all services I have no issues.

I have checked the first machine for the obvious; Closed Ports, etc.... 
I'm sure my problem is that I am a rookie at splitting these services 
and do not know the correct settings.
I was hopeful someone else has already been successful with this and 
would share their robust.ini files so that I could see where my mistakes 
are.

Thanks.
</PRE>
