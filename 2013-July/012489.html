<PRE>Hello all,

I was wondering if it is possible to configure how often the automated 
simulator diagnostics is ran, and if so, where at?

It seems like every hour when the diagnostics is ran it results in 
hanging my entire system up for about 30 - 45 seconds which results in a 
variety of interesting things such as the viewer hanging up entirely for 
that duration, music stops playing if listening to music via external 
media player, other programs hang up, etc. It also tends to translate to 
lag for other people connected to my setup for about that long as well.

I know the ideal situation would be to run OpenSim on a system dedicated 
to that; but right now I have no choice but to run it on the system that 
I do all my other daily things on. So I would like to configure 
diagnostics to run every say...  8 hours or so? It would make the system 
hangs a bit more bearable :)

If it's not configurable externally I'm willing to stick my head into 
the source code and change it manually there if need be; if I could be 
pointed to the file and location in the code to change it... It's just 
driving me insane lol.

Thanks!
