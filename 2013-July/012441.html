Ah, thank you, James! This was not immediately obvious &#8212; it was clear that
0.7.6 includes new modules (or old ones... I can't remember when the core
developers decided to push profiles out of the core, forcing us to live
with external services, and now, well, we got all these back again), but it
was unclear how to configure them.

Seems that the &quot;right&quot; way to do so is simply to disregard all old external
functionality. Since it's not so easy to figure out where the changes are,
for completion's sake, I'm including them here:

On OpenSim.ini that means getting rid of

[Profile]
Module = &quot;OpenProfileModule&quot;
ProfileURL = <A HREF="http://&lt;your">http://&lt;your</A> external webserver&gt;/os_services/profile.php

and just make sure the following is active:

[UserProfiles]
  ;# {ProfileURL} {} {Set url to UserProfilesService} {}
  ;; Set the value of the url to your UserProfilesService
  ;; If un-set / &quot;&quot; the module is disabled
  ;; ProfileServiceURL = <A HREF="http://127.0.0.1:8002">http://127.0.0.1:8002</A>
  ProfileServiceURL = <A HREF="http://&lt;your">http://&lt;your</A> OpenSim address&gt;:8002

Then, if you're using Robust, it means also:

On GridCommon.ini, make sure you have commented out the old [Profile]
section.
Wherever you have HomeURI set to your external webserver for profiles to
work, just revert it to <A HREF="http://&lt;your">http://&lt;your</A> OpenSim address&gt;:8002

Then, on Robust.HG.ini for a hypergrid'ed gri), just comment out all
HomeURI set to the external webserver. Thankfully, now we don't need to
configure that over and over again; once HomeURI is set at [Hypergrid], it
will remain the default for everything (yay).

Under [LoginService] make sure SRV_ProfileServerURI is also set to <A HREF="http://&lt;your">http://&lt;your</A>
OpenSim address&gt;:8002

[UserProfilesService] needs to have Enabled = true and the ConnectionString
set to the database where the profiles are stored. Now this was a neat
trick! Indeed, I can confirm that the old tables work flawlessly with the
new configuration. In my case, I had them on a separate database, but
OpenSim has no trouble connecting to it. Table names for profiles, picks
(and allegedly classifieds...) are the same, and so are all the columns.
Whew! It was much, much simpler than I expected.

And as a bonus, I finally got profiles working with Hypergrid teleports :)
something which I never managed to get working properly. Hooray!

Once more, thank you for the precious tips!

Now back to figuring out how to get collisions on attachments... heh.
