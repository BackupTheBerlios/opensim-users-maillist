<PRE>Hi Dahlia,
If I understand you correctly, if I upload a grass plant in mesh and
then just multiple copy it inworld, it would not make a difference if
made a grass patch in mesh and then uploaded it. Let me know, am kind
of dabbling with this issue right now. Am thinking in the way for
leaves in a tree.

&gt;<i> If an object is made up of many pieces, all of which are the same mesh, then
</I>&gt;<i> it would be better to upload the mesh once and just duplicate it. This is
</I>&gt;<i> because the mesh is a single asset and the viewer *should* only download it
</I>&gt;<i> once. However, each piece is still a single &quot;prim&quot; whether it's a prim, a
</I>&gt;<i> sculpt, or a mesh, and will still require a message from the sim
</I>&gt;<i> (ObjectUpdate packet) telling the viewer that it is there. This message is
</I>&gt;<i> quite small compared to the size of the mesh asset though and many of them
</I>&gt;<i> can be sent quite quickly. If the same mesh was uploaded many times and
</I>&gt;<i> these different uploads were used in the same scene, then each mesh would
</I>&gt;<i> get a different Asset ID and the viewers would have no way of knowing they
</I>&gt;<i> were all the same and would need to download each copy separately; this
</I>&gt;<i> could put quite a strain on the simulator and the network and should be
</I>&gt;<i> avoided.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note that in Second Life, &quot;Land Impact&quot; may be adversely influenced by many
</I>&gt;<i> copies of the same mesh *even though the mesh only has to be sent to each
</I>&gt;<i> viewer once*. This is an oversight in the design of Land Impact and
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSimulator does not have this issue as it does not implement Land Impact.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I've been working with Blender 2.6, and while I'll admit it takes a bit of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> adjusting if you're moving from prim based modeling it works perfectly with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> opensim uploading through either Firestorm or Kokua.  Scaling is a bit of a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> headache but after upload my models show exactly as they did in Blender and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> oddly enough, they seem to actually load a bit faster.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> While on the topic of mesh, I did have a quick question to anyone out
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there regarding instancing.  Awhile back (before the advent of mesh) I seem
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to remember someone mentioning that sculpts were superior to normal prims as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> only one copy of the sculpt is downloaded and then applied to all objects it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> was used on by the viewer.  Would anyone happen to know if the same holds
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> true for mesh?  Say in the case of an model with multiple duplicated pieces,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would it make better sense to include one copy of the duplicate piece in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dae and then duplicate it in world or just glob it all together during the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> import?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
