<PRE>I'm extremely surprised to hear this - no significant CPU operations are involved in printing this information.  Are you 
absolutely sure that some other timed script isn't running at the same time?  Also, when did this problem start?

</I>&gt;<i> I was wondering if it is possible to configure how often the automated simulator diagnostics is ran, and if so, where at?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It seems like every hour when the diagnostics is ran it results in hanging my entire system up for about 30 - 45 seconds
</I>&gt;<i> which results in a variety of interesting things such as the viewer hanging up entirely for that duration, music stops
</I>&gt;<i> playing if listening to music via external media player, other programs hang up, etc. It also tends to translate to lag
</I>&gt;<i> for other people connected to my setup for about that long as well.

</I>&gt;<i> I know the ideal situation would be to run OpenSim on a system dedicated to that; but right now I have no choice but to
</I>&gt;<i> run it on the system that I do all my other daily things on. So I would like to configure diagnostics to run every
</I>&gt;<i> say...  8 hours or so? It would make the system hangs a bit more bearable :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If it's not configurable externally I'm willing to stick my head into the source code and change it manually there if
</I>&gt;<i> need be; if I could be pointed to the file and location in the code to change it... It's just driving me insane lol.

</I>&gt;<i> Thanks!
