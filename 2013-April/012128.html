<PRE>Last night I tested with 2 avatars on the same machine OpenSim is 
running on, one avatar on one machine and one avatar on a different 
machine, and both avatars on a machine other than the one OpenSim is 
running on.

I repeated my tests today a bit more in depth and it would seem that the 
issue does not depend so much on the viewer the person transferring the 
item is using but more depends on what viewer the person on the 
receiving end of the inventory transfer is running.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Offer an item transfer to another avatar that you aren't afraid to lose (Creating a new prim and taking it to inventory then offering that is sufficient)

2. Decline the transfer on the other avatar and it should go to that avatar's trash folder.

3. Empty that avatar's trash folder.

4. Go back to the first avatar and try to rez, wear, or otherwise utilize the item that was to be transferred (In my case I attempted to rez the object).
    a. Should notice that it won't have any effect
    b. Look in the console and there should be errors to the effect of &quot;item not found&quot;

    My error when attempting to rez the object:
    16:11:48 - [INVENTORY ACCESS MODULE]: Could not find item 6d3689ee-5c06-478d-8c10-10870cc6e788 for Test User in RezObject()

5. Relog the avatar you attempted item transfer from. The item will be missing from their inventory upon relog.

Test results:
(Format: Item Transfer -&gt; Viewer name of the person receiving item.)

Item Transfer -&gt; Singularity (1.8.0) = Missing inventory item
Item Transfer -&gt; Firestorm (4.4.0) = OK
Item Transfer -&gt; Hippo OpenSim (0.6.3) = Missing inventory item
Item Transfer -&gt; Imprudence (1.3.0) = Missing inventory item
Item Transfer -&gt; Phoenix (1.6.0.1600) = Missing inventory item when 
using normal Discard, OK when using (Discard) (Silent discard)
Item Transfer -&gt; Radegast (2.12.1354) = Missing inventory item
Item Transfer -&gt; Kokua (3.5.1.27984) = OK
Item Transfer -&gt; CoolVL (1.26.8.1) = Missing inventory item

It seems like if the issue triggers, there will be two copies of the 
declined object that will show up in the receiver's trash folder. The 
tests also apply to offering entire folders of items. It also looks like 
on declining the transfer, If there are any other items directly under 
neath it in the person transferring the item, those items will some how 
wind up in the other person's lost and found folder. If the person 
deletes those items from lost and found it will remove those items also 
from the other persons inventory.

As far as the viewer I use; I mainly swap between Phoenix, Imprudence, 
and Singularity. As for other users on my install it could be any of the 
ones listed in the tests (And possibly others, but these are the main 
ones I was able to come up with).

&gt;<i> Chris, are you testing this with yourself e.g. With 2 Viewers running on the Same machine ? Or are you testing this behaviour with your avatar and a different users Avatar ? And by the way which Viewer do you (and the other user) use ??
