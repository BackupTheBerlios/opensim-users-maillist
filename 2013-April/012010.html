<PRE>I hope this message isn't filtered out because you might think this is 
an ad.  But there is a product in Secondlife I would love it. if it was 
also available in Opensim. I bought one and it works incredibly well in 
SL.  It is at 
<A HREF="https://marketplace.secondlife.com/p/LandMap-Change-your-ground-texture-without-land-powers/236734">https://marketplace.secondlife.com/p/LandMap-Change-your-ground-texture-without-land-powers/236734</A> 
on Marketplace.  It is called JVTEK's landmap.  It lets you put out a 
device that gives you options to move markers over a land area as big as 
32m x 32m.  Once you select the area it reads the shape of that land and 
produces a sculpty on a web site and give you the link to download it.  
You then drag and drop from your inventory to the device and it places 
it right on top of that area of land and lets you make small 
adjustments.  When you're done you remove the device and the post 
markers go to.  Then you can use any texture you want on that sculpty.  
He gets $L 1500 each, so I doubt they will just hand it over to Opensim, 
but I heard he made it from some avaialble source someplace.  Maybe 
someone could figure out something like that for Opensim?  Who ever does 
it, will be a hero to so many in the Opensim metaverse.  ;)

Somebody, anybody?

Your friend,

InuYasha

</I>&gt;<i> requiring the need for additional mesh uploads).  Still, my findings

</I>&gt;<i> alternative that is more consistently viewed by all users.

</I>&gt;<i> Does anyone know of any examples of mesh terrain uploads in the

</I>&gt;<i> terrain appears (on both a Mac and a PC!).
