<PRE>Hello all,

  I've come across a potential major issue with inventory offers. If I 
offer an item or a folder to another avatar and that avatar declines it 
and then later purges it from their trash folder it has the effect of 
the original item being removed from the first avatars inventory (not 
immediately visual until a relog). If the first avatar tries to use the 
affected object it results in item not found errors in the console.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Offer an item transfer to another avatar that you aren't afraid to 
lose (Creating a new prim and taking it to inventory then offering that 
is sufficient)

2. Decline the transfer on the other avatar and it should go to that 
avatar's trash folder (I noticed multiple copies of said object being 
created in the trash folder)

3. Empty that avatar's trash folder.

4. Go back to the first avatar and try to rez, wear, or otherwise 
utilize the item that was to be transferred (In my case I attempted to 
rez the object).
     a. Should notice that it won't have any effect
     b. Look in the console and there should be errors to the effect of 
&quot;item not found&quot;

     My error when attempting to rez the object:
     16:11:48 - [INVENTORY ACCESS MODULE]: Could not find item 
6d3689ee-5c06-478d-8c10-10870cc6e788 for Test User in RezObject()

5. Relog the avatar you attempted item transfer from. The item will be 
missing from their inventory upon relog.

This also has the same effect if attempting entire folder transfers, but 
the entire folder including its contents will be missing upon relog.

Has anyone else noticed this?

Thank you!
