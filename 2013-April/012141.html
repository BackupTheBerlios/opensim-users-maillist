<PRE>So that Dahlia knows who to blame, I was the one who created this check.  I was very tired of accidentally teleporting 
to very remote regions and screwing up my session and I don't think it's a good user experience.

As other people have said, this restriction is configurable.  One could also have a regular expression whitelist to let 
selected viewers to attempt the teleport.

I don't favour changing the default until there are a significant proportion of viewers in use that could handle 4096+ 
teleports.  As we've seen, we're not even sure what the problem is in the LL viewer codebase and TPVs.

&gt;<i> Thanks Dahlia. The explicit limit was added by Diva to try to make lie easier for users/avatars getting stuck in limbo, but can be turned on and off with an OpenSim.ini parameter, default being that it is on. So it can clearly be removed. Now there is a distinct branch for some viewers like Firestorm, and that there are already improvements in Firestorm 4.4.0(OS) to improve the OpenSim experience, some critical issues like zthe rally panful and awkward to explain to new users 4096 jump issues just might now be on te cards to be fixed.

</I>&gt;<i> I am sure if this were technically possible in commonly used LL viewers with an Openim specific branch then the OS server side default setting for the 4096 jump restriction could simply be set as OFF by default rather than ON by default?
