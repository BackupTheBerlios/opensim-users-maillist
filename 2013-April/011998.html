<PRE>[I cannot answer the question concerning &quot;which mesh-enabled OS viewer is
the most lightweight.&quot;  Note:  I like the Firestorm viewer and the Kokua
viewer (and especially the shadows in the Kokua viewer).]  However, I just
discovered (and solved) a viewer issue that everyone wishing to accommodate
both PC virtual world users and Mac virtual world users needs to know
about.

I just installed a Firestorm mesh-enabled OS viewer on a Mac Air laptop.
[Note:  I previously exclusively used PC-based viewers to access and build
in OpenSim.]  In turn, when first accessing my own private grid I noticed
the ground textures were only a [blinding] mix of the mountain and rock
terrain textures (that are in the default terrain texture boxes 3 and 4 in
the Terrain Tab in the Region/Estate drop down menu).  In turn, any student
(and in particular, new students) that first sees such a barren virtual
world landscape is likely to have a less than enthusiastic reaction to
virtual world learning.

To make a somewhat long &quot;trial and error&quot; story short, the easiest solution
to the above problem is to make sure to change the default terrain texture
settings for all OpenSim islands.  In particular, for the sake of Mac
users, if you want grass to show up on the ground level (around 24 meters)
there has to be some green grass in terrain texture box 3.

Has anyone else encountered and/or solved the problem of dissimilar ground
textures when moving from a PC-based viewer to a Mac-based viewer?

Also, any tips for where to get the best 1024 x 1024 ground textures?

Best,
Kay
