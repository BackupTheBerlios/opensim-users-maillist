<PRE>I wasn't looking for people to blame, but now that you mention it.....
*evil grin*

I am a little concerned that a bit of a catch-22 situation has come about
with the current solution.  Viewer developers are unable to test in
existing grids due to the default setting, and nobody will want to change
the setting as it might disrupt the user experience. Any viewer testers
will need to overcome the hurdle of learning that the setting exists and
setting up a test grid. In the mean time users of alternative viewers are
left out in the cold.

 What would you consider &quot;significant&quot;? Personally I'd consider Radegast
usage significant and it is not based on LL code. While it's based on
libomv and I have had success teleporting beyond 4096 with other libomv
based clients, I've not been able to test it in Radegast to date due to the
existing default.

Perhaps a protocol extension might be an alternative? Some way that a
viewer could signal the simulator that it's capable of distant teleports
and the sim could bypass the restriction for such viewers?
