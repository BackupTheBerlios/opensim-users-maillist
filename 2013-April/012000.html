<PRE>I second the Singularity recommendation, with the caveat that although 
it has the ability to view mesh, it does not (yet) allow for mesh 
upload. It is actively maintained and supports most new features.

&quot;Lightweight&quot; does sorta depend on your hardware, though. If your 
netbook has Intel's HD3000 or HD4000 GPU, for example, Singularity is 
still gonna bog down in some regions if you have all the pretty bells 
and whistles on, particularly those associated with deferred rendering. 
Where Singularity fits well is with your screen resolution. Many V3 UI 
elements or floaters are weirdly large, and won't allow a user to resize 
them down much. A V3 viewer that has CHUI improves this situation 
somewhat, though this UI still has a few bugs. Kokua has a CHUI build, 
for example.

I haven't seen a viewer that supports storing user and configuration 
settings in the application directory, personally.
