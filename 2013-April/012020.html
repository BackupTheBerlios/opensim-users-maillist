<PRE>Our OpenSim grid has been running continuously since version 0.4 from 
September 2007... and has probably by now accumulated a LOT of stuff 
that has not been garbage collected.

We are changing to some new more powerful core servers in the next 
few weeks, and I had an idea of how to do the upgrade that MIGHT get 
rid of the clutter while still keeping in place the region UUIDs (for 
web map servers, etc), the avatar UUIDs for permissions and .ini 
files that refer to these, and even perhaps the UUIDs of key assets 
in case they are in scripts.

but i am assuming that the IARs and OARs work by trying to reuse the 
UUIDs if they are not already use din the data base.

Will this process work..

1. Save each region as an OAR and the avatar inventories we wish to 
carry over as an IAR

2. Create a completely fresh data base - empty.

3. Create the avatars we want to preserve using the ption to set a 
specific UUID for them

4. Start up with the original region.ini files which have the old UUID in them

5. restore the OARS to the relevant regions, and the IARs to the 
relevant avatars.

6. Then fingers crossed we have a smaller neater, no clutter version 
of what we have now?

Or is that just plain silly and we have to take over more, or dump to 
SQL and restore the data base as is?

Any comments from devs or those with experience of a migration would 
be appreciated before we try this if its going to be a waste of time.  Ai
