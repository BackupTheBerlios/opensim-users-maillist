<PRE>Is anyone else having a serious issue with uploading mesh avatars to the
r22043 diva distro? I'm using Kokua and opensim.exe on a Windows 8-64 bit.
Clean install on diva. Kokua's the only mesh-upload viewer I can find that
runs okay on my computer. (T_T)
I was once able to upload a mesh avatar from makehuman. (Total crashing
started after that, where the entire viewer would crash when I clicked on
the preview checkbox for skin weights.) Now mesh upload seems to crash for
me every time with the following message in the console:

HandleRequest() threw     at
OpenSim.Region.ClientStack.Linden.MeshUploadFlagModule.MeshUploadFlag(Hashtable
mDhttpMethod)

I googled it and found a solved mantis [1] that says that something similar
was fixed, but the OP had a lot more error code than I have, and I don't
understand which debugging I'm supposed to enable and how to do that.

The only difference I can think of is that I almost crashed the sim with a
few too many badly scripted &quot;schooling fish&quot; I was trying to build, to
recreate a certain experiment. Am I exceeding some kind of memory footprint
still? The fish were self-kill, but it looks like Opensim doesn't handle
llDie very well. Should I be avoiding that too?
