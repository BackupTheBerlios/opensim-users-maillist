<PRE>I was thinking in class about something the instructor was not taking
about: the desire for a default space for new users of personal OS sims to
become familiar with their new environment. I thought, perhaps I could
create an oar that could be conveniently loaded that would be chock-full of
scripts and friendly building sandboxes and tutorials of whatever is most
helpful.

So my questions are:

1) (most important) what kinds of tutorials does a new user want/need?
Should they focus on building big things, or small things, or scripting, or
troubleshooting common problems?

1a) What was the first major challenge that you had when you first started
with OpenSim?

2) what would be the most efficient system for sending whole regions from
one Sim to another? I had issues importing oars on my setup- there were no
scripts or poses included when the file owner had said they were.

3) would anybody be willing to help with this? I barely know anything
myself, I just know where to find how to do it. Do you have any ideas on
how to arrange stuff or good resources for me to refer to while creating
this whole project? Would you like to donate a model? It would be fun to
have an art gallery hallway section that goes on for a ridiculously long
time, but all the artworks on the sides are actually unique.

4) what are/where do I find the limits of current technology? Like how many
NPCs can rationally fit on a Sim?

This idea is somewhat refreshing to me, and I'm enjoying thinking about it
a lot. Do you have any input?
