<PRE>Hmm... That is a bit strange. On the viewers I thought to be OK I was 
able to utilize the test object after the test (By attempting to rez the 
object and looking to see if it would appear or not and watching the 
console for errors). However, I based all my tests transferring an item 
from Phoenix viewer (which is currently my viewer of choice) to the 
viewers in my test results since it didn't seem to make a difference 
which viewer the item came from, just the viewers they were going to. I 
managed to lose a script I spent about 8 hours working on in the process 
due to the Lost and Found folder issue explained toward the end of my 
previous email (D'oh!)... but I was able to recover it by grepping a 
dump of my database and then dumping the most recent asset.

I did a quick test as I was writing this with a transfer from Firestorm 
to Firestorm on seperate computers and with viewers on the same computer 
(Computer OS is running on) to be sure but I was not able to reproduce 
the issue in this way. I also tried with both HTTP Inventory on and off 
as well but it didn't seem to make a difference. The Lost and Found 
issue also does not show up on the viewers listed as OK in my previous 
tests with the exception of Phoenix viewer, it's OK when using silent 
discard, but the issue shows up when using regular discard.

As an addendum to my previous test, I also noticed that if other avatars 
had a copy of the object you gave to another avatar, and the issue is 
triggered, then that particular object will missing from the other 
avatars inventories as well. Just to be clear, when I say missing, I 
mean that it seems to be missing from the database, but not visually 
from the inventory (at least not until a relog); can't do anything with 
the object in the way of using it such as rezzing, wearing, 
transferring, etc.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I repeated my tests today a bit more in depth and it would seem that

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> person on the receiving end of the inventory transfer is running.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Steps to reproduce:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1. Offer an item transfer to another avatar that you aren't afraid to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> lose (Creating a new prim and taking it to inventory then offering 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that is sufficient)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2. Decline the transfer on the other avatar and it should go to that 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> avatar's trash folder.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3. Empty that avatar's trash folder.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 4. Go back to the first avatar and try to rez, wear, or otherwise 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> utilize the item that was to be transferred (In my case I attempted 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to rez the object).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     a. Should notice that it won't have any effect
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     b. Look in the console and there should be errors to the effect 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of &quot;item not found&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     My error when attempting to rez the object:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     16:11:48 - [INVENTORY ACCESS MODULE]: Could not find item 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 6d3689ee-5c06-478d-8c10-10870cc6e788 for Test User in RezObject()
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 5. Relog the avatar you attempted item transfer from. The item will 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be missing from their inventory upon relog.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Test results:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (Format: Item Transfer -&gt; Viewer name of the person receiving item.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Item Transfer -&gt; Singularity (1.8.0) = Missing inventory item
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Item Transfer -&gt; Firestorm (4.4.0) = OK
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Item Transfer -&gt; Hippo OpenSim (0.6.3) = Missing inventory item
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Item Transfer -&gt; Imprudence (1.3.0) = Missing inventory item
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Item Transfer -&gt; Phoenix (1.6.0.1600) = Missing inventory item when 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> using normal Discard, OK when using (Discard) (Silent discard)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Item Transfer -&gt; Radegast (2.12.1354) = Missing inventory item
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Item Transfer -&gt; Kokua (3.5.1.27984) = OK
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Item Transfer -&gt; CoolVL (1.26.8.1) = Missing inventory item
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It seems like if the issue triggers, there will be two copies of the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> declined object that will show up in the receiver's trash folder. The 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tests also apply to offering entire folders of items. It also looks 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> like on declining the transfer, If there are any other items directly 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> under neath it in the person transferring the item, those items will 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> some how wind up in the other person's lost and found folder. If the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> person deletes those items from lost and found it will remove those 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> items also from the other persons inventory.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As far as the viewer I use; I mainly swap between Phoenix, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Imprudence, and Singularity. As for other users on my install it 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could be any of the ones listed in the tests (And possibly others, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but these are the main ones I was able to come up with).
