<PRE>Hi there.  All build links before 0.5.6 and the unofficial builds were 
originally removed because we were getting a lot of traffic on IRC from 
fairly non-technical people talking about missing/broken features or 
configuration problems with OpenSim.  Of course, we all know that we 
have a lot of these, partly because OpenSim is pretty immature code, and 
partly because we're implementing a server for a client which is 
expected lots of currently unimplemented features.  However, I gather 
that quite a few people coming on IRC didn't recognize this fact.  It's 
also the case that recently, OpenSim builds have been a little unstable. 
  Removing the binary distributions was, I believe, an attempt to raise 
the bar to use OpenSim temporarily until the project is more stable again.

However, I see as of this evening, pretty much everything has been added 
back.  Now to me that's fair enough - if you make your website an open 
wiki, you've got to expect people to come and edit it.  What we may need 
to do now is to see if the problem recurs and what alternative methods 
we can use to ratchet down the expectation levels (short of immediately 
fixing all bugs and implementing all features :-)
