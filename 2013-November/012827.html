<PRE>I just want to check that I am getting the right setup for building 
OpenSim 0.8.0 dev master now we have switched to .NET 4.0 as 
previously it seems that the tools to run runprebuild.bat and 
compile.bat were by default in all versions of Windows I have used. I 
am pretty sure I have .NET 4.0 installed in them all - I checked the 
registry on one and it says the .NET 4.0 &quot;Full&quot; version installed is 
(release 378675). But, I have never installed Visual C# Express or 
like tools on any of my OpenSim build machines before as far as I 
know, though they may have been alreday included in the Vista, Win7 
and Win8 systems we use.

It seems that &quot;msbuild&quot; is needed as part of the OpenSim compile.bat 
script and is not present even on the very latest Windows 8.1 Pro 
systems... as I get an error saying that msbuild is not available...

D:\Temp\opensim-fd24147&gt;compile.bat

D:\Temp\opensim-fd24147&gt;\msbuild opensim.sln
'\msbuild' is not recognized as an internal or external command, 
operable program or batch file.

So, as you indicated, I am looking at the downloads for Visual C# 
2010 [Express] on Windows and the (free) download from Microsoft says 
that a licence key is required after initial trial use...  at

<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/downloads#d-2010-express">http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/downloads#d-2010-express</A>

They indicate that &quot;After installation, you can try this product for 
up to 30 days. You must register to obtain a free product key for 
ongoing use after 30 days. &quot;

So, is that correct, all Windows users need to add this setup onto 
their Windows system in order to use the prebuild.bat/compile.bat 
route from now on?

</PRE>
