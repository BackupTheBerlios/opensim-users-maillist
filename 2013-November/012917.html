<PRE>When I asked here a few days ago about using Amazon EC2 for hosting OpenSim,
I was wondering about it both for a client and for myself.  I now believe
that EC2 meets my own needs, but I'm still not sure about the best way for
my client to go.  The company has an idea for a virtual world that has
potential to be big. 

The three choices are using Amazon EC2, or renting a generic dedicated
server, or using an OpenSim hosting service such as Dreamland Metaverse,
SimHost, or 3D Hosting (I'm not sure the last one would work because in the
preliminary stage, my client's preliminary focus is on the North American
market).

I haven't considered using an OpenSim hosting company for expanding my own
small virtual world because I'm technically adept and can do the work
myself.  However for my client, I'm wondering whether might be more cost
effective for them to use a company like Dreamland or SimHost rather than
paying me to provide custom services and create software that those
companies already provide.

I'd love to do the technical work for my client, but I want to give them the
advice that will benefit them most.  If anyone can point me to articles,
forums, or other resources that could help me decide on the best course for
my client to follow regarding EC2 vs OpenSim hosting vs generic dedicated
hosting, I really want to hear from you.
