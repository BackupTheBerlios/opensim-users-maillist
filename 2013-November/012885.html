<PRE>When I was working with an organization using EC2,there was a bizarre occasional performance glitch where CPU would jump 
to 100% and all other processes would be locked out.

I believe this was an OpenSimulator bug which has since been fixed, though it was curious this was never seen in any 
other context.

Regarding instances, dual core was the absolute minimum.  I can't remember what these instances were composed of 
exactly, but they seemed to run OpenSimulator reasonably well.

I would strongly advise you avoid single core instances, OpenSimulator has traditionally performed very poorly with 
these.  Things might be different with 0.7.6 but I suspect not enough to make it a feasible option for anything other 
than a lone avatar with little content or activity.

As always, more cores is better.  But if you're running continuously you may be better off with a leased server - it 
will work out much cheaper.
