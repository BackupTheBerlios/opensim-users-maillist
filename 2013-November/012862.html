<PRE>Hi Gary
What you describe is almost exactly what is happening to me at times.
I must admit i have a rather &quot;odd&quot; setup in that i am not behind a router
nor firewall . Reason for it is I am connected using WCDMA direct to my ISP
with a always on connection and dynamic IP. This caused a lot of hassle
trying to connect because of ports. In win 8 even opening the TCP/UDP ports
in the firewall somehow checking them through canyouseeme.org return a &quot;port
closed&quot; result. My ISP told me that I have an unrestricted APN with no ports
blocked from their side. Most folks I asked all said my port forwarding or
NAT is a problem could not understand that I have a direct connection
without a router ,so, Eventually i registered a domain name and pointed the
NS to no-ip using their software to keep my IP updated, I tried again. I was
then able to connect to OSGrid using the HG. After not being able to get
back home, I connected using my laptop with my regions login uri, the laptop
has its own ISP connection, and is not part of any LAN. I could connect
using the HG and I could TP back home everytime without issues. So I am
thinking the problem must be somewhere on my setup and the clue you have
provided does look so familiar, perhaps could it be an error in my
forwarding of the domain.?
