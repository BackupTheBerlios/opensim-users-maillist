<PRE>Hi all,

I tried telling the individuals who answered my first email back in March
about this, but I haven't gotten any responses yet.

I'd really like to compare the results I'm getting from my study with
someone else's - I've posted instructions at
<A HREF="http://hokiegrid.cs.vt.edu/index.php?&amp;page=smodul&amp;id=34&amp;btn=33&amp;subbtn=34">http://hokiegrid.cs.vt.edu/index.php?&amp;page=smodul&amp;id=34&amp;btn=33&amp;subbtn=34</A> and
I'd really like to talk to some of you about reproducing my experiment.
 Please?  It's for science!

Thank you,
Elizabeth Lowry

&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My name is Elizabeth Lowry and I'm a Master's Student in the Computer
</I>&gt;<i> Science program at Virginia Tech.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As part of my thesis, I'm going to be running a user study using OpenSim.
</I>&gt;<i>  I'll be packaging my setup, including the data collection tools, in an OAR,
</I>&gt;<i> and I'm hoping some of you will be willing to reproduce my experiment using
</I>&gt;<i> that OAR and let me compare your results to mine.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The idea of the experiment is to measure the effect of levels of spatial
</I>&gt;<i> presentation in a virtual environment on that environment's effectiveness.
</I>&gt;<i>  I'll be presenting two lessons -- one on the photoelectric effect, a topic
</I>&gt;<i> with a level of inherent spatial content, and one on a yet-to-be determined
</I>&gt;<i> topic that isn't inherently spatial, like music or logic -- at three levels
</I>&gt;<i> of spatial presentation -- as a slide show given in the virtual world, as a
</I>&gt;<i> set of posters arranged in space (with the slides from the
</I>&gt;<i> previously-mentioned slideshow as the posters), and as a set of full-on 3D
</I>&gt;<i> exhibits (presenting the same information as the slides) taking advantage of
</I>&gt;<i> a virtual environment's ability to present 3D objects.  Subjects will visit
</I>&gt;<i> exactly one of the topic/level-of-spatial-presentation combinations for a
</I>&gt;<i> set period of time and their learning will be measured by comparing their
</I>&gt;<i> scores on quizzes before and after visiting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The question I'm hoping to answer is: How much effort is really worth it in
</I>&gt;<i> the construction of a virtual learning environment?  And does this level of
</I>&gt;<i> effort vary between topics that are inherently spatial and ones that aren't?
</I>&gt;<i>  If the full-3D versions of the learning environments in the study lead to
</I>&gt;<i> the greatest improvements in quiz scores, it'll indicate that the greater
</I>&gt;<i> amount of effort required to build such environments pays off in better
</I>&gt;<i> learning.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Obviously, more work would need to be done in the future, whatever the
</I>&gt;<i> results of this study -- but to get solid results on this study, I'd like
</I>&gt;<i> your help.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is anyone on this list in a position to run a user study in OpenSim with 30
</I>&gt;<i> or more participants by mid to late April?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you,
</I>&gt;<i> Elizabeth Lowry
