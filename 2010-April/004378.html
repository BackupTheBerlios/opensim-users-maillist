<PRE>i posted a request to the pilot group, if they're interested in participating. 
Will the results of the research be public?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My name is Elizabeth Lowry and I'm a Master's Student in the Computer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Science program at Virginia Tech.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As part of my thesis, I'm going to be running a user study using OpenSim.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  I'll be packaging my setup, including the data collection tools, in an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  OAR,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and I'm hoping some of you will be willing to reproduce my experiment
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; using that OAR and let me compare your results to mine.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The idea of the experiment is to measure the effect of levels of spatial
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; presentation in a virtual environment on that environment's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; effectiveness.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  I'll be presenting two lessons -- one on the photoelectric effect, a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  topic
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with a level of inherent spatial content, and one on a yet-to-be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; determined topic that isn't inherently spatial, like music or logic --
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; at three levels of spatial presentation -- as a slide show given in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; virtual world, as a set of posters arranged in space (with the slides
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; previously-mentioned slideshow as the posters), and as a set of full-on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3D exhibits (presenting the same information as the slides) taking
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; advantage of a virtual environment's ability to present 3D objects. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Subjects will visit exactly one of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; topic/level-of-spatial-presentation combinations for a set period of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; time and their learning will be measured by comparing their scores on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; quizzes before and after visiting.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The question I'm hoping to answer is: How much effort is really worth it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in the construction of a virtual learning environment?  And does this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; level of effort vary between topics that are inherently spatial and ones
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that aren't?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  If the full-3D versions of the learning environments in the study lead
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the greatest improvements in quiz scores, it'll indicate that the greater
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; amount of effort required to build such environments pays off in better
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; learning.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Obviously, more work would need to be done in the future, whatever the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; results of this study -- but to get solid results on this study, I'd like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; your help.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is anyone on this list in a position to run a user study in OpenSim with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 30 or more participants by mid to late April?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thank you,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Elizabeth Lowry
