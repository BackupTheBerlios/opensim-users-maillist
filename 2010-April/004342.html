<PRE>The User Experience Interest Group (UXIG) [1] is taking a field trip
from its usual home in Second Life, and visiting OSGrid to discuss
topics of potential interest to OpenSim users and developers.

We met last week to discuss the topic, &quot;What OpenSim users and
developers want in a viewer&quot;. You can read the summary and transcript
from that meeting online: &lt;<A HREF="http://bit.ly/april15uxig">http://bit.ly/april15uxig</A>&gt;

The topic for this week's discussion is, &quot;How the viewer might evolve
if it weren't limited by SL compatibility.&quot;

This should be a entertaining and intriguing topic, with plenty of
speculation about what the virtual world experience might be like if
developers were free to innovate without worrying about compatibility
with present-day Second Life. We may get some practical gems out of
the discussion, but mostly I expect to have a lot of fun talking about
it! :D

The discussion will be tomorrow, April 22, in the Wright Plaza lounge
area on OSGrid. It will start at 22:00 UTC (3:00 PM PDT) and go for an
hour (maybe longer). Everyone is welcome to attend and participate.

I hope to see you there!

- Jacek

P.S. If you can't attend the discussion but would still like to share
your thoughts, feel free to email me personally, or discuss it here on
opensim-users. :)
