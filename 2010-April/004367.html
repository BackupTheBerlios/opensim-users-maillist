</I>&gt;<i> As for myself I would love to be able to use Emerald on Opensim Grids, but
</I>&gt;<i> when I do it has texture issues with avatars.  Everything else is beautiful,
</I>&gt;<i> but if you are lucky enough to see others at all they are never fully rezzed
</I>&gt;<i> and you end up a cloud.  But I love the features and miss them when in
</I>&gt;<i> opensims.  And heh not just the brest physics.  Exporting builds to my own
</I>&gt;<i> hard drive, the area serach has helped me find loose pets and items that
</I>&gt;<i> just flew off in some direction, and much more.  I already know why I can't.
</I>&gt;<i>  Something to do with SL newest method of bakeing textures on its AV and
</I>&gt;<i> opensim project still using the old way.  But still if a new viewerr, wheth
</I>&gt;<i> hipps ads features or we start freash, I want to have more of the features
</I>&gt;<i> availalbe that are in the Emerald viewer.  And yes, I admit it, breast
</I>&gt;<i> physics too. The ladies just look so much more real.
</I>&gt;<i>

I've created a new viewer, based upon the Emerald sources. Although this
viewer was created primarily to support the display of Youtube movies inside
Second Life, I also wanted to use it for OpenSim and ran into the same
problems as you.

The viewer I created, is changed slightly, so that regular textures do
download and display succesfully, However, there still is an issue with the
baking of and uploading of textures, which causes issues in combination with
Opensim. I believe these issues are caused by the use of the Emerald
specific 'kakadu' libraries (emkdu.dll). To 'work around' the baking issue,
rename the emkdu.dll file, so that the viewer can't load it during startup.
It will then use either OpenJpeg libraries or llkdu.dll (if available).

The viewer can be found on the TEKSTUFF website: <A HREF="http://www.tekstuff.net/">http://www.tekstuff.net/</A>

Make sure you have Emerald installed already, then download and install the
TEKSTUFF installer, and start the viewer using the TEKSTUFF shortcut. It
should use all the current settings from the Emerald installation.

Regards,

Bulli Schumann
