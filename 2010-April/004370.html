<PRE> From what I understand... Emerald versions 15xx and up uses the HTTP 
texture method to download textures for viewing on the client. I believe 
a recent-ish git has started to add support for this method but the 
latest stable release (0.6.8) does not seem to support this. I have been 
using Emerald 1101 on OpenSim for a while with out any texture issues 
(at least that I can tell). Try it with 1101 and see if it fixes that 
for you :)
