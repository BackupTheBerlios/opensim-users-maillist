</I>As for myself I would love to be able to use Emerald on Opensim Grids, 
but when I do it has texture issues with avatars.  Everything else is 
beautiful, but if you are lucky enough to see others at all they are 
never fully rezzed and you end up a cloud.  But I love the features and 
miss them when in opensims.  And heh not just the brest physics.  
Exporting builds to my own hard drive, the area serach has helped me 
find loose pets and items that just flew off in some direction, and much 
more.  I already know why I can't.  Something to do with SL newest 
method of bakeing textures on its AV and opensim project still using the 
old way.  But still if a new viewerr, wheth hipps ads features or we 
start freash, I want to have more of the features availalbe that are in 
the Emerald viewer.  And yes, I admit it, breast physics too. The ladies 
just look so much more real.

That's my opinion, how about yours?

Please Ladies, no hate mail, it is just nice to see some sence that 
there might be gravity in the world.
I know you wish you could, but real life woman don't defy gravity with 
them. ;)

Thanks for your time,
InuYasha Meiji
