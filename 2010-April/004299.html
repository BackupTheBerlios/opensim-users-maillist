<PRE>I am using the latest git release I downloaded from OS grid.  Version: 
OpenSim 0.6.9 (RC1)  0.6.9-post-fixes 5ea498a: 2010-04-026 (interface 
version 6), and was wondering, is grid mode even possible in standalone 
mode.  I seem to be running fine, except for grid mode.  I know where to 
turn it on but it still seems to be unable to find  my user server.  It 
actually still seems to think it wants to find the OSGrid user server.  
I set gridmode to false, and my AVs and object data all runs fine.  I 
can log onto my own grid and a friend from another country can log on as 
well.  but no matter what I seem to do, Grid mode doesn't work.

I was thinking of running my opensim under grid mode itself, but then I 
run into trouble as well.  I am running under Windows 7 64-bit.  And it 
uses the ports for the servers 8000-8006 for its own internal use.  I 
had to set my stand alone for port 9030 and on.  And I opened my ports 
8009-8019 to allow for those server ports.  But then I find I haven't 
found out if those servers can even be told you use other ports beside 
the 8001-.

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks for your time.
InuYasha
