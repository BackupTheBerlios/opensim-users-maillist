i'm not sure why it doesn't work but for ports, try to use only 9000-9010
range in your setup (works great with me)
The reason you can't teleport  could be a firewall problem on your server or
the one your trying to reach..
it doesn't accept inbound or outbound traffic.. 

---
Basic explanation:
NAT Filtering (loopback)

This option determines how the router deals with inbound traffic. The
Secured option provides a secured
firewall to protect the PCs on LAN from attacks from the Internet, but it
may cause some Internet games,
point-to-point applications, or multimedia applications not to work. The
Open option, on the other hand,
provides a much less secured firewall, while it allows almost all Internet
applications to work.
----

for external address you could use  <A HREF="http://www.dyndns.com">http://www.dyndns.com</A> Dyndns , 

-----
Basic explanation:

A Dynamic DNS (DDNS) Service provides a central public database where
information (such as e-mail addresses,
host names and IP addresses) can be stored and retrieved. The Dynamic DNS
server also stores password-protected
information and accepts queries based on e-mail addresses. 
---


if this is all good, we have to look further...  Witch (git repository)
version of opensimulator are you using?
git master and post-fixes versions 0.7.xx are fairly stable right now (not
sure with 0.7.0.1 yet).  if grid servers are 0.7 compatible, if not, use
0.6.9

double check all .ini files, see if all settings are correct.  or copy
.ini.example files and change them according to your setup.  

hope this helps... 
for opensimuator log output use  <A HREF="http://pastebin.mozilla.org/">http://pastebin.mozilla.org/</A> PasteBin  or 
<A HREF="http://imagebin.org/">http://imagebin.org/</A> ImageBin  for images (temporarily storage) 
 
let us know if it works..
