Does it also treat the avatar as phantom?

Just in case, you might want to try the latest git Master code, since I recently put in a fix that stops non-root prims 
being 'phantom' on initial shift-copy in-world duplication (though things are fine after a server restart).  I suspect 
that this doesn't have anything to do with your problem but it's worth checking.

As a last resort you may want to fiddle with the [ODEPhysicsSettings] section in OpenSim.ini, though I've no real idea 
if this will help.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) When restarting my opensim server/region, all the object's script
</I>&gt;<i> disappears. This means I have to save everything into my inventory
</I>&gt;<i> before I close down the server and then rez them back and relocate them
</I>&gt;<i> EVERY TIME. Is this a known problem or is there a step where I missed
</I>&gt;<i> that will save the script before I quit the server?
</I>
In prim scripts should be being saved without any extra user actions.  I suggest you carefully check your OpenSim 
configuration.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) This one is probably unsolvable unless there's an update on physic
</I>&gt;<i> engine. My partner on the same project made a pendulum that pivot on a
</I>&gt;<i> triangular shape. When the pendulum reaches it's highest peak on it's
</I>&gt;<i> swing, it shakes vigorously. After a long time the pendulum will
</I>&gt;<i> eventually shift position. I'm guessing this is due to rounding
</I>&gt;<i> calculation on the contact point of the pivot point when it reaches it's
</I>&gt;<i> highest peak, causing the pendulum to &quot;shift-slightly&quot; causing it to
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;shake&quot;.
</I>
I suspect you're right, though I'm no physics expert.  OpenSim currently uses ODE 10.1.  Some folks are experimenting 
with ODE 11.1 with good results.  I updated the OpenSim wiki at

<A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/PhysicsEngines">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/PhysicsEngines</A>

with those instructions (I haven't actually tried this myself).
