<PRE>Hi folks.  Just fyi, it appears that there are issues with completely new avatars in viewer 2.

When you first create a user (e.g. via &quot;create user&quot; on the command line), OpenSim creates it without any body parts or 
clothes set.

Viewer 1.2x doesn't have any problems with this, it simply puts a Ruth (default avatar) in until you create clothes and 
body parts.

Viewer 2, however won't let you put on new clothes or body parts until it downloads an existing set.  As these don't 
exist, you can't stop being steam - the viewer no longer comes with Ruth built in.

One workaround here is to first log in with Viewer 1.2x (or equivalent) and set enough body parts and clothes to make 
Viewer 2 happy.  The minimum set is all 4 body parts (shape, eyes, hair, skin), a shirt and pants.

The errors a fresh standalone spits out on a new avatar login with viewer 2 are

     22:53:55 - [LOCAL INVENTORY SERVICES CONNECTOR]: Could not find item with id 66c41e39-38f9-f75a-024e-585989bfaba9
     22:53:55 - [LOCAL INVENTORY SERVICES CONNECTOR]: Could not find item with id 77c41e39-38f9-f75a-024e-585989bfabc9
     22:53:55 - [LOCAL INVENTORY SERVICES CONNECTOR]: Could not find item with id d342e6c1-b9d2-11dc-95ff-0800200c9a66
     22:53:55 - [LOCAL INVENTORY SERVICES CONNECTOR]: Could not find item with id 77c41e39-38f9-f75a-0000-585989bf0000
     22:53:55 - [LOCAL INVENTORY SERVICES CONNECTOR]: Could not find item with id 77c41e39-38f9-f75a-0000-5859892f1111

These appear to correspond with the default IDs used in 1.2x.  So hopefully it will just be a case of properly 
satisfying these requests.
