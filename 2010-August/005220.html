<PRE>Hey, thanks for the reply.
1) No, it doesn't treat the avatar as phantom and it will interact with
*some* physical object just fine (when they're fine, they don't tend have
the problem any more).

Sorry, but I'm relatively new to OpenSim, I'm not sure what you meant by
&quot;git Master code&quot; but I encountered this problem using 0.6.9 and recently
just changed to 0.7.1 and still encountering this problem. I've looked into
the ODE section under OpenSim.ini but found nothing really useful in there.

2) I have played around on 0.7.1 and this problem don't seen to be occurring
any more. I have everything set as default when using 0.6.9 however.

3) Interesting. I am currently using OpenSim under windows, and the page
don't seen to have much details on using ODE 11.1. I will give it a try
though, but any extra help would be appreciated!

Thanks again!

</I>&gt;<i> Does it also treat the avatar as phantom?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Just in case, you might want to try the latest git Master code, since I
</I>&gt;<i> recently put in a fix that stops non-root prims being 'phantom' on initial
</I>&gt;<i> shift-copy in-world duplication (though things are fine after a server
</I>&gt;<i> restart).  I suspect that this doesn't have anything to do with your problem
</I>&gt;<i> but it's worth checking.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a last resort you may want to fiddle with the [ODEPhysicsSettings]
</I>&gt;<i> section in OpenSim.ini, though I've no real idea if this will help.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2) When restarting my opensim server/region, all the object's script
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> disappears. This means I have to save everything into my inventory
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> before I close down the server and then rez them back and relocate them
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> EVERY TIME. Is this a known problem or is there a step where I missed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that will save the script before I quit the server?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In prim scripts should be being saved without any extra user actions.  I
</I>&gt;<i> suggest you carefully check your OpenSim configuration.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3) This one is probably unsolvable unless there's an update on physic
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> engine. My partner on the same project made a pendulum that pivot on a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> triangular shape. When the pendulum reaches it's highest peak on it's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> swing, it shakes vigorously. After a long time the pendulum will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> eventually shift position. I'm guessing this is due to rounding
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> calculation on the contact point of the pivot point when it reaches it's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> highest peak, causing the pendulum to &quot;shift-slightly&quot; causing it to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;shake&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I suspect you're right, though I'm no physics expert.  OpenSim currently
</I>&gt;<i> uses ODE 10.1.  Some folks are experimenting with ODE 11.1 with good
</I>&gt;<i> results.  I updated the OpenSim wiki at
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/PhysicsEngines">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/PhysicsEngines</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> with those instructions (I haven't actually tried this myself).
