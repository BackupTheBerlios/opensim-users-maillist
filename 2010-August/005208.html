If by transferring you mean loading items into someone's inventory then there were/are a few ways

1)  Direct DB manipulation, as you know

2)  In OpenSim 0.6.x there was an application plugin called the 'REST interface' which allowed you to add asset and 
inventory via a, well, REST interface :)  This only worked via the region and unfortunately it was not being maintained, 
so got dropped after the user and inventory service refactors.

3)  Construct and load IARs.  In principle, you might be able to do this via the 'REST remote console' (not the same as 
the REST remote interface above), if you could place them at a known location on the filesystem and don't have a problem 
with requiring the user password.

4)  WEBDAV via SimianGrid.  Don't know the details of this - only including it because others have mentioned it but I 
believe it is a viable way :)

I suspect that all these methods will also require you to construct suitable assets.  This can be a bit hairy since some 
of the formats (in particular the serialized object format) are largely undocumented and not very suitable for external use.
