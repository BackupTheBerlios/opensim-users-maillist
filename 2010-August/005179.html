<PRE>I should have said I am using a grid setup with Robust HG.

I checked the database tables... presence does not seem to have the 
relevant field in there.  But griduser has an Online field and that 
shows as &quot;false&quot; or &quot;false&quot; for all users.  Note the different 
capitalisation for different avatars.  Is that right?

All griduser entries show as Online = false/False when no avatars are 
logged in.

I logged on as my main avatar and checked the griduser table 
again.  The single avatar logged in has griduser field Online = True.

The friends list showed the usual problematic 3 avatars as 
bold/online... but the griduser table does not show them as online.

Could the capitalisation be causing the problem?
