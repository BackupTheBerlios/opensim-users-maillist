<PRE>For some reason I have three well used avatars (they are my own 
avatars and set as friends of my main avatar for testing purposes but 
that may not be relevant)  who are always showing as online and bold 
in the friends list.  Doing IM to them indicates the IM is sent 
rather than queued as it should be if they were known to be offline. 
But I know they are not logged in.  iin fact the Opensim,exe console 
logs that it is unable to send the IM in red, but a  normal user 
would not have seen that or realise anything is wrong.

If I login and the log out each of the three avatars, they do show as 
going offline, and stop showing as bold in the friends list of the 
avatar I am using.  And then if I try IM to any of them it says they 
are offline and correctly queues and later delivers the IM messages 
to the right avatars.

BUT, when I log off and back on just using the normal the LL 1.23.5 
client (not restarting the OpenSim.exe, Robust.exe or data base note) 
the same 3 users are back showing as online again.  The other 20 or 
so avatars in the friends list never cause a problem.

I probably have some glitch in the MySQL data base, or it could be 
that a logout of an avatar that had had some issues earlier has a 
status entry that  is wrong.

Is there anything I can do to correct this for my own grid?  So IM 
(online and offline works correctly after that and the presence 
indicator for online is not misleading.

But perhaps more importantly, might there a way to make the presence 
handling code more robust, so a logoff really does clear whatever 
flag must have got jammed.

Should I note it on mantis, or assume its a result of glitches along the way.
