<PRE>Well there are a couple of reasons why not, most of all is that I am
involved with a bunch of RL things that take most of my time. The time I do
get to spend here I have been using to bring up my own sim under V0.7.x

Last time I looked the  realXtend stuff (including the viewers) was Windows
only and I use Linux almost exclusively for my software development now. One
of the very few exceptions is a Win 7 partition devoted to Poser Pro.

It was Adam's stuff that I was referring to with the OS &quot;hooks&quot; - I have no
idea about the specifics though.

&gt;<i>From what I have been seeing with the current Linden Lab/Second Life
</I>drama(s) I sure wouldn't count on Second Life to do much of anything for a
long time!

I monitor a web site that specializes in &quot;restrcited&quot; stocks like Linden Lab
and I notice that they haven't even posted a bid on that stock since March.
Even for a pre-IPO stock that is a very long time without any buyers - there
is almost always someone willing to buy at a steep enough discount. This
leads me to believe that the Linden Lab situation of far worse than anyone
is admitting.

All of that being said, I do hope to get involved with your efforts (and
maybe do some Linux/Ubuntu related support :-)  ) once other things settle
down a little.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You don't have to even install the rex module to your server if wan't to

</I>&gt;<i> I've experienced that testing out and doing things, like putting some of
</I>&gt;<i> your favourite meshes to a scene so that can walk around them, perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> attach some fun LSL to them etc., gives you more ideas of what can do
</I>&gt;<i> etc., so can be useful even if you don't up ending that tech for
</I>&gt;<i> production. BTW in rex you can also use skeletal animations in normal
</I>&gt;<i> meshes in the scene (not just avatars).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Many of the &quot;hooks&quot; have been added to OS V0.7.xx, but there is still
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; work to be done.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What do you mean? I haven't noticed, apart from Adam's SOG/SOP refactor
</I>&gt;<i> in that branch which is partly about changing the internals so that
</I>&gt;<i> things like prims and meshes can be implemented in modules (ModMesh,
</I>&gt;<i> ModPrim etc. that add those components and can be configured on/off
</I>&gt;<i> etc).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sure it'll probably be great when Linden finally comes out of the closet
</I>&gt;<i> with their LLMesh support. I've personally been quite surprised that
</I>&gt;<i> it's been taking so long, after they started on it 1,5 years ago and
</I>&gt;<i> showing screenshots a year ago and people saying in early Feb this year
</I>&gt;<i> that it'd be out of the private testing in late Feb etc. But I guess
</I>&gt;<i> things are not so easy when you have a world to run with lots of people
</I>&gt;<i> using it etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So am curious if there's something stopping you now, and we can help if
</I>&gt;<i> there are questions or quirks along the road.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> BTW: after we introduced the mesh support 2,5 years ago, we haven't been
</I>&gt;<i> just sitting on our hands but done some other things .. like full scene
</I>&gt;<i> export from blender &amp; max &amp; maya and friends, a new modular viewer with
</I>&gt;<i> a customizable UI, support for adding your own client side features in
</I>&gt;<i> plugins, and now finally support for arbitary data in scene entities
</I>&gt;<i> that is synched between the server &amp; all clients so custom functionality
</I>&gt;<i> can use it all over .. we'll now improve the APIs and make new demos
</I>&gt;<i> during the rest of the year so can show something fun :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is all developed in the open, no behind closed doors dev or private
</I>&gt;<i> betas, and is open for suggestions and contributions etc .. so please
</I>&gt;<i> feel free to try and welcome to participate!
