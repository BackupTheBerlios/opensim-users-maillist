<PRE>I have been doing some preliminary tests of adding in the osprofile 
module to make avatar profiles work on my grid.  ASnd I am 
confused... as well as not having got it working.  I am sure its 
simple as others seem to have it fine in their setups.  But any 
pointers would be appreciated to save some time...

1. Is there a known good version which works in 0.7?  There seems to 
be the sourceforge version from melanie, and an xoopensim version 
that suggests it fixes issues in running with 0.7.  The data bases 
created by these two setups are quite different, so I assume they are 
not compatible which seems a big pity.

2. I also wonder if osprofile can be added in alone, or if some other 
module such as ossearch is required as well?  I ask as I had some 
messages along the way saying serarch was not enabled when I tried to 
&quot;apply&quot; an update the user profile.

3. I also see some mantis entries suggesting that core OpenSim needs 
to populate the profile databases with the avatar UUID and DOB.  If 
that is so how does it know what DB to use... I ask as the setup 
instructions seem to imply a separate database &quot;osmodules&quot; should be 
used, and I did that - so its separate to my main opensim database, 
though on the same db server.  Is that a problem, and should I start 
afresh and add the osprofile tables directly into the same database 
as my main opensim content?

4. Our main web server PHP version is 5.1.4 by the way, and its 
difficult to get that updated due to safety concerns by our system 
admins. Is this a known issue and does osprofile reuiqre a later 
version of PHP?  I see a mantis entry for an errore I ma getting at 
<A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=4798">http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=4798</A> that suggests it was 
fixed by using a later version of PHP which is why I ask.
