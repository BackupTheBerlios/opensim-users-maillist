If you look at my post from 31 July 2010 14:59 I was seeing the same ID
numbers causing errors in my console screen and at the time
I was using the &quot;Second Life 1.23.5 (136262) client.

You get the same errors when trying to &quot;make outfit&quot; (I right click on my
avatar and choose &quot;appearance&quot; and I use the make outfit option my client).

I had narrowed issue down to the default shape, skin, eyes and hair; it
seems that if you are wearing any of the defaults it fails to make a copy of
them into an &quot;outfit&quot; folder when you try to use the &quot;make outfit&quot; in the
appearance menu. 

So it looks like even though the &quot;Ruth&quot; avatar is wearing hair and clothes,
the actually hair and clothes are missing in the assets list/inventory. 

Hope this is helpful.

James

Subject: [Opensim-users] Known appearance changing problems with a
completely new avatar in Viewer 2

Hi folks.  Just fyi, it appears that there are issues with completely new
avatars in viewer 2.

When you first create a user (e.g. via &quot;create user&quot; on the command line),
OpenSim creates it without any body parts or 
clothes set.

Viewer 1.2x doesn't have any problems with this, it simply puts a Ruth
(default avatar) in until you create clothes and 
body parts.

Viewer 2, however won't let you put on new clothes or body parts until it
downloads an existing set.  As these don't 
exist, you can't stop being steam - the viewer no longer comes with Ruth
built in.

One workaround here is to first log in with Viewer 1.2x (or equivalent) and
set enough body parts and clothes to make 
Viewer 2 happy.  The minimum set is all 4 body parts (shape, eyes, hair,
skin), a shirt and pants.

The errors a fresh standalone spits out on a new avatar login with viewer 2
are

     22:53:55 - [LOCAL INVENTORY SERVICES CONNECTOR]: Could not find item
with id 66c41e39-38f9-f75a-024e-585989bfaba9

These appear to correspond with the default IDs used in 1.2x.  So hopefully
it will just be a case of properly 
satisfying these requests.
