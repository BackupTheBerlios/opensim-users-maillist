<PRE>Hi all,

I'm using OS 0.6.9 Post-Fixes (Recent as of about a week and a half ago; 
maybe two weeks. Don't remember exactly) and I've started noticing 
recently that when ever I log out and then log back in later, all the 
regions surrounding me disappear except the region that I logged out 
from. I can still see the regions on the map, but if I try to cross over 
to one of them by walking/flying past the sim border, my avatar gets 
stuck and I have to relog. I've found that I can select the region on 
the map and TP to it (even though I can't actually see the region in 
world) and it lets me TP to it, the region appears all of a sudden and 
it works fine... for a few seconds. After a few seconds I get the &quot;You 
have been logged out of Second Life&quot; message and I'm logged out.

Would anyone happen to know why this may be happening? It has been 
working fine for me up until now. I cleared out my MySQL database and 
restored from a backup that I had and the issue still persists.

Any insight on this would be greatly appreciated.
