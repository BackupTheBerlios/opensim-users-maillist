I can help a bit here my assuring you that there are implementations for 
various llDetectedTouch functions in OpenSim. I haven't made use of 
llDetectedTouchPos myself, but I have used llDetectedTouchFace and 
llDetectedTouchST in the Speedbuild Board on OSGrid which sees regular 
use, and has had no issues. Taking a quick look at OpenSim's code, I can 
see that there are also implementations for llDetectedTouchBinormal, 
llDetectedtTouchNormal, llDetectedTouchPos, and llDetectedTouchUV.

In my experience, the default script engine in OpenSim does have its own 
quirks. There are slight differences in variable scope and error 
handling. OpenSim's XEngine tends not to be as tolerant of many of the 
little tricks and shortcuts that are permissible over at SL. I find it 
is generally best, when possible, to write script specifically for 
OpenSim. You certainly can port a script to or from SL and OpenSim, but 
one needs to be prepared to chase down errors and rewrite lines that the 
script engine doesn't like. The larger and more complex the script, the 
worse this chore can be.

I think the largest differences will be seen in any script that deals 
with server-side physics. This isn't so much the script engine's fault 
so much as that OpenSim's ODE physics engine and many of it's settings 
are simply different than the Havok physics engine that SL uses, and ODE 
often handles physical objects with much less finesse.
