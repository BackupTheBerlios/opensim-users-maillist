<PRE>Don't know if this ahs been answered, I'm not quite awake yet *sips
coffee*, but Ener wrote a two part article about HG &amp; SoaS. Here's the
links ....
Part 1: <A HREF="http://iliveisl.com/hypergrid-from-sim-on-a-stick-if-you-are-german/">http://iliveisl.com/hypergrid-from-sim-on-a-stick-if-you-are-german/</A>
Part 2: <A HREF="http://iliveisl.com/hypergrid-from-sim-on-a-stick-part-2/">http://iliveisl.com/hypergrid-from-sim-on-a-stick-part-2/</A>

Hope that helps

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am having trouble thinking through a problem I seem to be having with
</I>&gt;<i> an educational project for children we are making using OpenSim. The
</I>&gt;<i> children all have individual single-user pocket worlds which they keep on
</I>&gt;<i> usb sticks. (The installation uses Ener Hax's sim-on-a-stick.) We want them
</I>&gt;<i> each to be able to teleport to a shared social world on our university
</I>&gt;<i> server, much like Topology B on this page:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Hypergrid">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Hypergrid</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The social world has a static IP address. The usb sticks have no IP
</I>&gt;<i> address that is knowable in advance.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This project is intended to work with 2 school classes, and the staff
</I>&gt;<i> and pupils of those classes should be the only people in the social world.
</I>&gt;<i> The usb sticks should definitely not be on the public map. Neither should
</I>&gt;<i> the social world be available except from the usb sticks, which should only
</I>&gt;<i> be able to transport their users from the pocket world to the social world
</I>&gt;<i> and back again.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you already understand how to set this up to listen on the public
</I>&gt;<i> Internet, then you don't have very much left to do.... you just need
</I>&gt;<i> to set up a firewall *somewhere* (whether on the individual lab PCs or
</I>&gt;<i> on the hardware router/firewall that connects them together).
</I>&gt;<i> Actually, if you just put all the PCs on a common NAT, you don't have
</I>&gt;<i> to explicitly block any ports -- the ports will be blocked per default
</I>&gt;<i> because the router won't forward inbound packets anywhere unless you
</I>&gt;<i> explicitly set up port forwarding rules.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you literally have every student's machine hooked up to the public
</I>&gt;<i> internet with a unique public IP address, you can still set them up on
</I>&gt;<i> a software NAT using a reasonably beefy (and/or not very busy) regular
</I>&gt;<i> PC. You didn't state what operating system you have or any of the
</I>&gt;<i> technical details, so I can't provide any more specific help than
</I>&gt;<i> that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Basically don't worry about restricting opensim from accessing the
</I>&gt;<i> public internet. Instead, restrict the network layer with a firewall.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It will be significantly harder to prevent your students from
</I>&gt;<i> hypergridding to *other* grids from their client software. Hypergrids
</I>&gt;<i> can listen on an arbitrary port, even 80 (which is normally unblocked
</I>&gt;<i> for HTTP). Unless you have a very clever transparent proxy or forced
</I>&gt;<i> http proxy, you won't be able to (easily) distinguish between
</I>&gt;<i> students' legitimate outbound network traffic -- such as accessing the
</I>&gt;<i> university's library site in a browser -- and hypergridding to another
</I>&gt;<i> opensim community, such as osgrid or 3rd rock.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You *could* entirely disable public internet access during your
</I>&gt;<i> lesson, if you have full control over all of the student machines and
</I>&gt;<i> they don't need the internet for the exercise. This would be the only
</I>&gt;<i> way to definitively prevent them from going &quot;outbound&quot; to connect to
</I>&gt;<i> an arbitrary server. Just block all outbound ports on all outbound IPs
</I>&gt;<i> except for the CIDR of the LAN/NAT (probably 10.x.x.x or 192.x.x.x).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have read all the documentation and tutorials that I can find about
</I>&gt;<i> hypergridding, but I am still not sure of the best way to approach this. I
</I>&gt;<i> have an uneasy suspicion that this may be very simple and I am foolishly
</I>&gt;<i> over-thinking it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Could anyone offer any guidance please? I would be happy for anything
</I>&gt;<i> from a suggested starting point to a step-by-step guide.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you think it's going to be a problem to know the IP addresses of
</I>&gt;<i> the individual grids in advance, you'll need to use hostnames. Make
</I>&gt;<i> sure all the computers can ping each other by hostname, and make sure
</I>&gt;<i> the students can't change the hostnames. Problem (should be) solved.
</I>&gt;<i> You can now configure your grid based on the hostnames of the other HG
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;pocket worlds&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Lastly -- if this configuration is expected to be established over the
</I>&gt;<i> public internet with each of the students residing in their own house
</I>&gt;<i> or dormitory, using their own computer, I think the only way to make
</I>&gt;<i> it remotely possible would be to use a VPN such as Hamachi to get
</I>&gt;<i> everyone on the same LAN. But since you have no control over students'
</I>&gt;<i> computers or networks, all bets are off as far as getting them to
</I>&gt;<i> concentrate on the lesson vs. surfing the web. It's only really
</I>&gt;<i> possible to control a setup like this if you have all the computers
</I>&gt;<i> (owned by the school) set up in a room, all connected to the same
</I>&gt;<i> router. THAT should work as I described above.
</I>&gt;<i>
