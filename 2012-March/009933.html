<PRE>It isn't really anyone's fault, but I feel a bit disappointed in the 
osSetRegionWaterHeight(i); command.    I use the example script.  The 
one script that allows you to click on the object containing the script 
and it makes the water level rise and fall.  I have all my ini files 
correct and the script does work.

I got the water moving really pretty smoothly.  I was filled with 
excitement at the thought of at certain intervals, about as often as the 
sun moves in the sky, I could have a script check for the sun/moon 
position and move the water level according to the moon height in the 
sky.  I tried doing this myself.  BUT, here is the problem.  Until then 
I didn't realize while being the only one on my grid at that time that 
stopping to press the flag (The item I placed the script for testing), I 
wasn't attempting to walk while the water made its movement.

I only noticed when attempting to check sun position and move the water, 
while taking a walk.  Is tides to look like real tidal forced impossible 
to do in opensim, without causing this issue, and I am doing something 
horribly wrong?  Can it be done.  Or would moving the water and walking 
smoothly just something you can't do especially on multiple sims all at 
once?

All this time I had been using the whole possibility of tides in opensim 
as one of the more noticeable differences between SL and  opensim, to 
start up conversations about it.  It disappoints me a little that I have 
to tell these people I tried it and it really messes things up when I 
tried it.

I love opensim, and won't quit over just this.  So much great work has 
been going into it, and I appreciate it so much.  It give people like 
me, on fixed incomes, the disabled who don't know how long we can pay 
Linden Labs, to enjoy a virtual environment a free place to go and enjoy 
our dream world.  Thanks to all of your hard volunteer work.

Thanks again,
InuYasha
