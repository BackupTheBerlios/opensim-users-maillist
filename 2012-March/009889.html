<PRE>Hi Justin,

I finally got my Sa-Hg 0.7.3 &quot;serverless grid&quot; to work based on OS website
source download and compile.  However, there were numerous undocumented
changes that I had to guess at, reason-out based on the error logs and from
comparisons between the OS downloads and the Diva Distro, and many others I
had to just &quot;pull out of the air.&quot;

For example, the login calls to the MySQL dBase no longer &quot;tolerated&quot; a
literal &quot;10.0.0.10&quot; address in their &quot;DataSource&quot; field.  (It seems like
only the &quot;localhost&quot; now suffices?)  Deletion of the &quot;null.dll&quot; lines in
&quot;almost&quot; every case relative to their MySQL counterpart insertions wasn't so
shocking but I found it was necessary in almost every case.  (I'm thinking
that was new to 0.7.3?)  A substitution of more than a half-dozen HG-centric
lines taken from the Diva Distro configs and copied into the Hypergrid.ini
config was not listed in the OpenSim website downloads. And what can only be
described as an &quot;innovative omission&quot; of how to handle the PresenceService
null.dll line in the Hypergrid.ini file.  That little bugger had to be
deleted outright.

My test was a simple: a 4 Sim X 16 region/Sim demo with meter-scale L3DT
prepared USGS DEMS on a 32-bit XP SP3 machine.  This demo (kernel) can now
be expanded to my main 64-bit platform with port-mapping for 256 regions.  I
am truly appreciative for all the development teams hard work.  The region
crossings are better, the physics is impressive, and much much more.  Unity
still can't lay a finger on this technology.

Respectfully yours,

Chris

&gt;<i> I think I'm mistakenly giving the impression that they're much more flaky
</I>than they actually are (which might not be
&gt;<i> particularly flaky, more requiring some workarounds).  I do suggest trying
</I>them out.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It certainly is possible to improve things in this area, it's just
</I>difficult to estimate since it requires
&gt;<i> adaptation/improvements on both client and server side.  If I was to
</I>hazard a guess I would say a solid month on the
&gt;<i> server side and the same on the viewer side.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     It's interesting how much of this depends on the viewer, which tends
