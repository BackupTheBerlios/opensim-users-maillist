<PRE>Certainly, start here:     Gory details of which LSL script functions 
work and which don't are there.

<A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Main_Page">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Main_Page</A>

Note -- various grids run different versions of OpenSim,  eg, 0.7.3 was 
just released, and not all &quot;OpenSim&quot; worlds work the same way.  Best to 
try things and find the forum for the one you plan to use.

Basically,  (correct me everyone else where I'm wrong),  if you CAN 
export an object from Second Life,
you can reassemble and reimport it into the OpenSim worlds.  Of course, 
it will lose all the textures on the way, retaining only shape and 
color.    Unless you created the texture you cannot export it from 
Second Life, and even then I'm not sure.

BUT, of course, ALL SCRIPTING GOES AWAY too.
Meaning, you have to go into each and every prim of every scripted 
object, find out which scripts are in which prims, copy them out into 
some text editor, recreate the object, go back to that particular prim 
of that particular object,  create a new script, name it correctly, and 
then paste the copied script from Second Life into the place, and save 
it.    Objects with multiple prims can have scripts in each and every 
one of them, different scripts, some running, some not.   To my 
knowledge, there is no shortcut, no way to export and reimport all 
scripts to the right place and right states .

Even then, some scripts will not function correctly.  Usually the 
repairs, unless it involves physics, are just to do things like add 
curly braces where OpenSim expects them and Second Life lets you get by 
without them
Such as, paraphrasing one with a cryptic error message:

                    If (condition)  do x;   works in Second life, but
                    If (condition)  {  do x; }  is required in OpenSim, 
even for a single line &quot;do x&quot; on the same line.


GTG.
