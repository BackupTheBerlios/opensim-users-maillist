<PRE>I have an accelerometer attached to an Arduino set up to act as a 
standard USB HID joystick that can be used by an OpenSim viewer. The 
idea is that when you tilt the accelerometer up/down the camera tilts 
the same amount. I am using flycam atm because it doesn't seem that you 
can enable '3D cursor' in 'avatar' mode.

When the accelerometer is laying flat, it sends a value of around 0 on 
its Y axis, which is hooked into the pitch mapping of the OpenSim 
client's joystick control. When the accelerometer is titled upwards, the 
flycam pitches up &amp; when the accelerometer is tilted downwards, the 
flycam pitches down. All good so far!

When the accelerometer is returned to laying flat from being tilted up 
or down, it outputs ~0 on the Y axis &amp; the flycam should return to 
'level' (eg looking straight forward, parallel to the ground). This is 
where the problem lies. If I tilt the accelerometer up &amp; back to level 
several times, the 'level' position slowly raises, so that after a few 
tilts the flycam is pointing up into the sky when the accelerometer is 
held level. This happens if I tilt downwards &amp; return to level a few 
times too, but much worse.

I have tried all sorts of values in the joystick &amp; camera options but 
can't find anything that effects this issue. Pitch deadzone is set to 0, 
I have tried changing feathering, the pitch scale, camera transition 
time, camera smoothing, all to no avail.

I have tried the accelerometer joystick in Imprudence &amp; Firestorm, in 
case it was client-specific, but both exhibit the same behaviour.

Does anybody have any ideas?

Regards,
CJ Davies
