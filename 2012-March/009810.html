<PRE>I agree with Justin here. OpenSim networking is a complicated issue. 
These worlds don't do well when they are ported from one network to 
another -- at least not without some considerable expertise to fix all 
the networking configurations.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1. The children in the project are ten years old. The version of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Imprudence we are using has all the menus (and currently the maps)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2. The children are using Open Sim on a USB stick precisely so that 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they can use it from anywhere: from school (maybe), from home 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (definitely), and possibly from other places including friends and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> relatives.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3. Each world-on-a-stick is one-user only. They cannot ever directly 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> visit any other child's world-on-a-stick.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The system we envisage is strictly radial. At the centre is one 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> social world, running on the university server at Arcada. Each spoke 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is a single world-on-a-stick that should ideally operate in two 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> modes: a) as a strictly one-user personal pocket world, and b) as a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> means of connecting to the social world.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The social world is a club-house, populated only by the class of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> children and their two teachers. Ideally children would be able to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bring things from their pocket world into the social world and take 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> things back to their social world. Thus children can make things and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> then share them. They can take snapshots of their own world and share 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> them. But the cannot take anyone else back to their personal world.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The reasons why we want to make it like this are quite complicated, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and off-topic for this list, but I can post a link to a short paper 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if anyone is interested. (Short version: Pokemon is a single player 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> experience. Pokemon Arena allowed you to move your Pokemon into a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> shared world and compete against your friends.  Private learning 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> linked to social games.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I will try some experiments with Justin's ideas about landmarks. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> These raise the question of whether I actually need hypergridding at 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> all. What I think I actually need is to be able to teleport between 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the two worlds. Can this be done without making the social world 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fully accessible?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is there a better approach to achieve what we want?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You are trying to do something that I would say is currently very 
</I>&gt;<i> complex.  There are also security issues (opening up ports to enable 
</I>&gt;<i> hypergrid from outside your network) which running in a private vpn 
</I>&gt;<i> may alleviate (a big topic in itself).  Children make such issues more 
</I>&gt;<i> critical.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Using hypergrid will also require good upload bandwidth from the 
</I>&gt;<i> children's home computers.  I would say better than your typical ADSL 
</I>&gt;<i> line but I'd be very happy to be contradicted on this.
</I>&gt;<i>
