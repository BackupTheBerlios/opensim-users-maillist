<PRE>Since I got impatient waiting for a reply, I hope this works.  I moved 
all my builds to above 100m.  Since I am running a standalone I didn't 
see any reason to go with a standard land height or standard 
waterlevel.  So now my land is at sea level when around 100m and the 
ocean goes from the height of 95 to no lower then 20m.

So no worries of below zero builds or items.  Now all I hope is I can 
move land up in a spot nearing the middle to a flatened area that is at 
226m making my peak 126m higher then my base at 100m  Wish me luck.  I 
also want to try to get my land textures right.  I want land below 100m 
to turn to sand for a sandy bottom to my water.

What was that console command for setting a land level for an entire 
region? ')
see ya and thanks for your time.
