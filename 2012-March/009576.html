<PRE>I was only writing because I worked for hours comparing my old 
standalonecommon..ini and opensim.ini and made all the changes I had in  
my working 0.7.2 opensim using the 32bit launch.  Back then my profiles 
worked perfectly.  After making the upgrade, everything else seems to be 
working, all except the OSProfiles I used before.

Now I am wondering before I go on, was there something I may have missed 
like a dll I used to get it working that I don't have now that I 
upgraded?  IT has been a while since I last installed OSProfiles in 
0.7.2 and forgot if I had to add anything that didn't already come with 
the Binary Zip to it.  That's right, I don't compile my own.  That is 
why I was thinking I might have a dll musing.  Any ideas why my groups, 
offline messages,  and vivox all work, but my OSProfiles just seemed to 
die on me?

I would really appreciate it. You have all been a lot of help in the 
past, and I have always appreciated it.

Your Friend,
InuYasha.
