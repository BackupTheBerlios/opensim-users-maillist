<PRE>Actually Owen, Hypergridding it still pretty advanced stuff (imho) so I think you would have to be prepared for a few 
bumps on the way.

I'm assuming that the kids are coming into school and plugging their sticks into school computers rather than access 
over the open Internet (?).

In theory, you could have them create a local landmark on their own machine before hypergridding to the school server 
with the known IP address (and setting another landmark there).  Then they could teleport between the two with the 
landmarks without having to know the IP.  This would still make it difficult for them to visit each other's 
installations.  But if the IPs are dynamic then the landmarks would only be valid for that session, which might be 
confusing.

I suspect HG regions will not appear on the map.

If the children are always going to be on the university's network, you could consider going for a classic grid 
architecture instead, though then their regions will definitely appear on the grid map, unless you're using viewer 3 
with an unset MapTileUrl in the [LoginService] in GridCommon.ini (yes, this stuff is still pretty hairy :)

You might want to take my HG pronouncements with a pinch of salt - I haven't had a chance to use it recently and I'm not 
sure of the exact current details.

Best,

Justin

&gt;<i> Hi,

</I>&gt;<i> I am having trouble thinking through a problem I seem to be having with an educational project for children we are making using OpenSim. The children all have individual single-user pocket worlds which they keep on usb sticks. (The installation uses Ener Hax's sim-on-a-stick.) We want them each to be able to teleport to a shared social world on our university server, much like Topology B on this page: <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Hypergrid">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Hypergrid</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The social world has a static IP address. The usb sticks have no IP address that is knowable in advance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This project is intended to work with 2 school classes, and the staff and pupils of those classes should be the only people in the social world. The usb sticks should definitely not be on the public map. Neither should the social world be available except from the usb sticks, which should only be able to transport their users from the pocket world to the social world and back again.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have read all the documentation and tutorials that I can find about hypergridding, but I am still not sure of the best way to approach this. I have an uneasy suspicion that this may be very simple and I am foolishly over-thinking it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Could anyone offer any guidance please? I would be happy for anything from a suggested starting point to a step-by-step guide.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Many thanks
