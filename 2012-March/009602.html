<PRE>Permissions on prims are surprisingly complex,  with many unhappy 
surprises.
They are not well designed.

You have probably run into the problem that permissions have a sort of 
low-water mark on them, in that, in addition to what you expect, they 
are also tracking the LOWEST privileges you have EVER had for that object.
At least in Second Life, once you have less than ALL privileges, you can 
NEVER get them back again.

Example:  If I create an object,  set it to TRANSFER,  NO MODIFY, NO 
COPY, and give it to another avatar, and then the other avatar gives it 
right back to me,   those are the HIGHEST privileges I can get back.   
EVEN THOUGH I am listed as the CREATOR, and the current OWNER,   I no 
longer have modify or copy rights.    I cannot EVER have modify or copy 
rights again.  They are lost forever.

Simple web page which agrees with that assessment: (See the paragraph 
&quot;Getting permissions back&quot;.)

It's actually MORE complex than that, and depends on WHAT kind of object 
you are talking about ( a prim,
a notecard, a script, etc.)

Here's a much more detailed description of the visible and almost-hidden 
privileges on objects:

Sad, but true.   Apparently some or all of this legacy madness has been 
carried over into OpenSim.
