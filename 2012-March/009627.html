<PRE>The thing with timers on OpenSim versus LL servers is: OpenSim throttles 
timers to 0.5 seconds at the fastest. This is to prevent overload on 
your server and thus crashing it. The side effect is unfortunately that 
if you import a script from SL that uses timers lower than this it will 
appear to be slower on OpenSim than it is on SL.
