<PRE>ask around in IRC and at office hours and see what people think, more
than an official process (0.6.3 a good example of a release that sank
for me because of appearance bugs that would have upset quite a few
users on our grid). I had believed it was more a case of warning the
unassuming folks who just got latest code and hoped for the best. I was
wrong.

I made a bad call, I regret the inconvenience to anyone on ReactionGrid,
I regret the fact that I lost two hours to someone else's prank. What
hurts more is that I've been attacked by many whom I respect over the
course of the day for my own stupidity. I made the decision to stop with
regular contract work and work on an OpenSim project because it was a
platform I believed in with a core of good people who knew what they
were doing. I care about what I do, I care about my grid, and I don't
want to let people down. Fine, I'm in the minority, I'll stay there
happily.=20

more bitterness about the stretchy AVs prank

Okay. We get it already!

Yes, the core devs probably should be more aware of how precious
people's AVs=20
are to them (there is a TON of research on this).

But if someone's business and family are so reliant on the functionality
of=20
the server why the hell are they running off CVS head!?!? real bugs far
worse=20
than this hit head almost weekly. That is what head is for.

I only play in OS at present and even I keep a last-working-compile
around=20
until I have verified the new one is OK. Me thinks the user doth protest
(far)=20
too much.
