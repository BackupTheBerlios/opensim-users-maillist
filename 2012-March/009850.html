It has actually been configurable for ages, a compile time constant
called RegionSize or so.

Not everything works though if you change it, but basics do. Less worked
in 0.6 but with 0.7 it became somewhat usable.

I made a quick simple test back in Oct 2010 -- changed the size to 1024,
and could succesfully add objects to all of the area and move there and
see them all with the Naali viewer,
<A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOE_WNX05W0">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOE_WNX05W0</A>

Terrain is only visible in one of the corners of the big region, though.
Note: this is not a megaregion setup, but just a single normal region.

When I logged in to that same scene with SLviewer, it did not show
objects from outside the 256x256 corner. But folks said that at least
some slviewer based viewers do happily show objects from any
coordinates. Dunno if the Aurora folks have needed to modify viewer side
too, or whether it just worked.

IIRC the size has to be a multiple of 16 for the physics engine to not
bork. And when I tried to run a 10km * 10km region first it didn't work
out well, something ran out of memory or so :p

&gt;<i> aspirations just getting to 1/2/3km sims would make a huge difference,
</I>&gt;<i> even if we had to stick with existing prim limits.
</I>
Why don't you just pretend that 1m == 10m or so? Then the default region
size would be 2,5 * 2,5 km :) The avatars become giants? Can you perhaps
make them smaller?-)

&gt;<i> I think that RealXTend Tundra has removed the limitation, and Vastpark
</I>&gt;<i> (which also has some OpenSim heritage) has. Are we ever likely to see 
</I>
Yep the Naali viewer never had articificial region size limitations,
which I got to very and test by changing that Opensim constant. With
Tundra the same code is used for the server, I've made tests with a
100km long region actually (with the 'infinite drive' scene in tundra1
examples which automatically generates road ahead of you as you drive
forward .. just used the editor to jump 100km and i think the code then
generated the road all the way there, and i could then drive back etc :)

&gt;<i> a change in OpenSim (and if it's &quot;just&quot; a case of money, then how much
</I>&gt;<i> effort?)
</I>
Depends what you need working. If you don't need the normal linden style
terrain, and perhaps can skip physics too, then it might work already.
Unless things have broken since 2010. We sometimes do terrain / ground /
environment just with meshes.
