<PRE>I cannot claim any extensive experience such as classroom use, but I
have set up a demo at a Sci-Fi convention using Erik N.'s Mars Sim
<A HREF="http://metatek.blogspot.com/2010/06/mars-simulation-for-distribution.html">http://metatek.blogspot.com/2010/06/mars-simulation-for-distribution.html</A>

It ran over a LAN with 5 simultaneous users. We used the Imprudence
viewer and had no problems at all with children aged as young as 7-8YO.
In fact these younger children were more &quot;tech savy&quot; than their parents,
in one case a young girl showed her parents how to run the simulation!

I have had family children use our private sim at home, but they are
hardly typical since they have all grown up in a computer oriented
environment with many relatives who are professionals in the computer
field. Again the Imprudence viewer has served well.

We now use David Seikel's Meta-Impy <A HREF="http://onefang.net/drupal/meta-impy">http://onefang.net/drupal/meta-impy</A>
which is an enhanced version of the Imprudence viewer. David is now in
charge of the Imprudence development effort, so I expect that the two
versions will converge over time.

Both Meta-Impy and Imprudence are Opensim oriented and make no attempt
to maintain Second Life compatibility nor Linden Labs certification.

Our experience has been that the viewers present few problems, but
suitability of content for children can be a concern, especially in
Second Life even in supposedly &quot;PG&quot; areas.
