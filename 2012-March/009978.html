<PRE>There is definite room for improvement in megaregions on the simulator-side.

I also think there is still room to improve on region crossings.  However, the problem one has with region crossings is 
that you have to hand off the avatar between the thread running the scene loop in the source region and the one running 
in the destination region.

It's extremely tricky to do this smoothly, even when all regions are running on the same machine.  So I think the 
long-term direction will probably be to improve megaregions and co-operate better with viewers that better deal with 
regions that have a size greater than 256 x 256.
