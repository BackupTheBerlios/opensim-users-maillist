<PRE>James thank you for your time and feedback on those questions.

They have been a great help to making an informed decision on using
mega-region on one, and &quot;un-mega-ing&quot; another project (heavily based on
parcel media usage).

One thing I found during my inquiries on the subject, is that there seem to
be 2 major and different points of view with regard to the future of
mega-regions.
*One *being that they are the way to go - even though they are currently
somewhat problematic for certain implementations, work is underway to
overcome eventually all glitches.
*The other* being that they are basically only useful for building on a
&quot;grand scale&quot; and/or using vehicles - but when regular region issues (like
region-crossing) have been dealt with they are most likely to gradually fall
out of favor and even eventually disappear. 

Now this is not picked up from user chit-chat, but rather from discussions
with seasoned users/operators and opensim &quot;evangelists&quot;.

It would be of great help I believe, if there was some insight as to which
of the above (if any) seems to be the most likely development /or /even what
the current feeling is among the developing community.

I realize this is mostly a dev question, but I was wondering if you (or
anyone else) had something to contribute that sheds some light.

Thanks again

Cosmo T.
