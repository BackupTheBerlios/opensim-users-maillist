<PRE>Hello all,

I am having a strange issue with manipulating prim link sets with 
scripts utilizing functions such as llSetLinkColor, llSetLinkAlpha, (and 
possibly their single prim llSetColor and llSetAlpha counterparts), 
texture change functions, etc.

Whenever the object changes in any way, such as object name change/desc 
change, new inventory introduced to object, or even just simply opening 
the object's inventory and opening a notecard, script, texture, etc.; 
script based prim manipulation functions seem to not update the object 
with whatever changes are called depending on the function from then on 
after until the object is detached and reattached. After reattach the 
object will then be updated with the last attempted scripted change and 
the scripts will function and update the object as normal until the 
object is affected again by the aforementioned changes to it.

If the object is simply attached and not edited before attempting to run 
the script based changes it will update the prims with the colors, 
textures, alpha values, etc as expected. Although I have occasionally 
found that I've had to detach and reattach several times before it will 
start to work.

This only seems to affect objects attached to the avatar and not ones 
rezzed in world.

Is anyone else having this issue?

Thanks!
