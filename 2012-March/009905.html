<PRE>If there is physics support for a hanging rope (or chain or cord or 
elastic band) connected at both ends,  I have never seen it, and I've 
looked for it many times, for swings and ropes connecting my sailboat to 
the pier, etc.

If someone else has seen this work, let us know!  Maybe there's some way 
to do it with &quot;mesh&quot; objects these days.

Flexiprims only connect at one end, and you can't chain them together.  
Chains of links don't work because, well, physics is pretty bad -- they 
tend to explode or do other strange things.

You could fake the appearance of a cord by having a photograph of a 
hanging cord on a flat prim, and very cleverly stretching and rotating 
the prim -- but that would only work if you knew where both ends of the 
cord should be, and,  as you either know or will find out soon,   the 
avatar and attachments are all managed on the CLIENT, and the SERVER 
only knows where the avatar center of mass is,  let alone where an arm 
is, or a hand, or a held object like a handset.

And, there is no way to have a held handset report its region 
coordinates, because it doesn't know itself where it is. If you ask for 
llGetPos() or something, you get the coordinates of the center of mass 
of the avatar.   Sigh.

So,  basically, no, there is no good way to have anything that looks 
like a realistic cord connecting two objects,  at all (unless mesh does 
it), let alone one object that is an attachment and another object that 
is not an attachment, that I know of.

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am wondering if it is possible to realize this effect in OpenSim:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. A handset connects to the telephone via a cord.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. The cord must always at one end connect to the headphone and at 
</I>&gt;<i> another end to the telephone.
</I>&gt;<i> 3. The user can pick up the handset (NOT the entire telephone set) and 
</I>&gt;<i> when a handset is picked up, the cord remains connecting to the 
</I>&gt;<i> handset and the telephone.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is it too ambitious?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks!
