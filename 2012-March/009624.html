<PRE>Hello there,
I ported some of my Second Life scripts to opensim running on my local
machine. The scripts do make use of a lot of listeners which is
unavoidable given what I am doing. The interaction with various
objects was significantly less snappy than when the same scripts are
running on Second Life. During the port, I was worried about compiling
issues and so on ... I had only few all related to the fact that
opensim check types more strictly than Second Life. Other than that,
things run but unfortunately the interactions are slower.
It is possible that my laptop does not have enough resources to run
the opensim server, a connection to Second Life (Second Life viewer),
and a connection to the local opensim region (Second Life viewer).
What is your experience running lots of scripts in opensim, did you
notice any drop in performance (by that I mean, do things run slower?)
I understand this is a very general question, but wanted to know a
little bit about your experience/thoughts in this matter.
Thanks
Ramesh
p.s. also, I was using a script that fades an object before it is
removed, in Second Life, the fading happens quicker too ... however
animations work as usual, so don't know if the timer event in the
fading script is slower in opensim ... 1 millisecond in opensim is
longer than 1 millisecond on Second Life ...., just rambling out loud.
