<PRE>&quot;terrain level &lt;n&gt;&quot; I think

If you're using master, I've recently rejigged the help system so that if you type &quot;help&quot; you now get help by category 
(still further changes required).  If you type &quot;help terrain&quot; you'll see all the terrain commands.  To be fair &quot;help 
terrain&quot; was there before but it was obscured by pages of assorted commands.

</I>&gt;<i> level when around 100m and the ocean goes from the height of 95 to no lower then 20m.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So no worries of below zero builds or items. Now all I hope is I can move land up in a spot nearing the middle to a
</I>&gt;<i> flatened area that is at 226m making my peak 126m higher then my base at 100m Wish me luck. I also want to try to get my
</I>&gt;<i> land textures right. I want land below 100m to turn to sand for a sandy bottom to my water.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> see ya and thanks for your time.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I was under the possibly mistaken idea that if I started my sim flat with a 21m above sea level with a water level at
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 20, with a raise limit of 100 and a lower limit of -100 that I would find it simple to use the client's land editor to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> lower my land down to nearly 0 to give me a 20m deep ocean and be able to have a archipelago, flat top hills up to 120m
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> high.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> But it seems even with my land editing brush strength slider at 100% it barely drops to the water surface. I was hoping
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> for a land top height of 126m above sea level with fairly deep ocean water. Not as deep as the person I read about a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> while back making a titanic themed sim who wants to have the entire build underwater. If I can get nearly 30m under
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> water that would be great.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks for the help.
