<PRE>Subject: Re: [Opensim-users] Question about NPCs and attachments
&gt;<i>         (Chris)
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hmm I can't tell now. On the latest master the NPC rezzes in as a cloud
</I>&gt;<i> and on the console I see this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 14:06:35 - [NPC MODULE]: Created NPC
</I>&gt;<i> 8e0fd659-78a7-4e41-8187-d420d9d7e577 New NPC
</I>&gt;<i> 14:06:40 - [AVFACTORY]: user 8e0fd659-78a7-4e41-8187-d420d9d7e577 has no
</I>&gt;<i> inventory, appearance isn't going to work
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It has been past experience though that it doesn't matter if I detach
</I>&gt;<i> every thing first then reattach.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have seen that if I make a change to an attachment and then create an
</I>&gt;<i> NPC that change won't be reflected on the NPC's version of the
</I>&gt;<i> attachment until I first detach the attachment(s) and then reattach. But
</I>&gt;<i> to my knowledge I've never been able to get an NPC to render correctly
</I>&gt;<i> if it had more than one attachment on the same attach point (Such as
</I>&gt;<i> Hair (skull), Hat (skull), Pants (Pelvis), Belt (Pelvis) ).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I> I had not attempted multiple attachments for a while.  Testing this
morning indicates that only the first attachment on each attach point will
be saved and re-rez properly.   I cannot re-create your &quot;it causes my NPC
to be a cloud&quot; problem.  For me, the NPC rezzes consistently with the
single attachment.

I saw some interesting screen flashes while rezzing a bunch of the
testbots.  On some of the rezzes it looked like the initial attachment
occured, then  the second attachment was rezzed on the ground at the NPC's
feet and then de-rezzed again promptly.   That may indicate the attachment
was saved into the notecard and the osNPCgenerate function is the point of
failure...

I have been using scripted attachments on NPCs for some time.  Outside of
making sure the scripts can properly identify who they are attached to, and
leaving a couple seconds between NPC rezzes to allow the scripted objects
to initialize.  I haven't had any other issues...
