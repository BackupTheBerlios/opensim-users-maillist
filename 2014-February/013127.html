<PRE>Hello, I've been recently messing with scripting for in world &quot;server&quot; 
storage and retrieval for NPC appearances and I've come across an 
interesting issue involving attachments. If I attempt to create an NPC 
from an avatar that has more than one attachment per attach point the 
NPC won't render correctly; that is, on the newly created NPC, the 
attach point that had more than one attachment will either not have any 
attachments on it, or it will render the additional attachments nearby 
but &quot;floating&quot;, or it will only render one of said attachments in the 
correct spot. Often though, it's a combination of rendering one 
attachment in the correct spot, and the additional attachments nearby, 
floating, but seemingly unattached (if you bump the NPC around, the 
floating attachments won't follow, and they act as if phantom).

If the avatar is wearing one attachment per attach point then it works 
as expected and everything renders properly.

It's fairly easy to reproduce, simply wear a few attachments that attach 
to the same spot, and then attempt to create an NPC of yourself (or 
perhaps someone else with a similar attachment situation).

I am testing and seeing this on 0.7.6 Release and above. Is anyone else 
seeing this?
