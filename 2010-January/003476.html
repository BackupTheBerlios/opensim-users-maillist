<PRE>This is the difference between what you tell &quot;the world&quot; and what you tell yourself (and your team).

Certainly no one leaves a sign on their car saying &quot;I often forget to take my keys with me&quot;, but &quot;leaving a key under the mat&quot; is a time honoured tradition in many families. My mother in law's house being one such. :-)

If it makes everyone a little more careful then it can only help, but if someone gets the idea that only &quot;bad viewers&quot; cause harm (as I have seen loudly touted on less &quot;techie oriented&quot; forums) then it can give a false sense of security.

When that &quot;fools paradise&quot; is exposed it tends to lead to the kind of panic we see among some of the larger content creators in Second Life. That does nothing but harm for everyone!

</I>&gt;<i> It seems that this discussion is
</I>&gt;<i> about the impression of security vs 
</I>&gt;<i> actual security. On one side if something gives the
</I>&gt;<i> impression of 
</I>&gt;<i> security, but does little or nothing to make it more
</I>&gt;<i> secure, then it's 
</I>&gt;<i> better not to do it. On the other hand, every little bit
</I>&gt;<i> helps as long 
</I>&gt;<i> as the users don't interpret that as making them perfectly
</I>&gt;<i> secure. (You 
</I>&gt;<i> could almost say you might as well never do anything since
</I>&gt;<i> nothing is 
</I>&gt;<i> really perfectly secure.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My analogy would be this. If you have a convertible car,
</I>&gt;<i> with the top 
</I>&gt;<i> down, and no security alarm, (essentially the equivalent of
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim 
</I>&gt;<i> now), would it be better to leave your laptop sitting on
</I>&gt;<i> the passenger 
</I>&gt;<i> seat, under the passenger seat, or in a trunk that has no
</I>&gt;<i> lock on it? 
</I>&gt;<i> (My 1963 Austin Healey Sprite was such a car.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One could argue that you might as well leave it on the
</I>&gt;<i> passenger seat 
</I>&gt;<i> with a sign on it saying &quot;Take me&quot;, because it's no safer
</I>&gt;<i> there than any 
</I>&gt;<i> of the other options. But if it was my laptop, I'd hide it
</I>&gt;<i> under the 
</I>&gt;<i> seat or in the trunk. Does this give me a false sense of
</I>&gt;<i> security? 
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps. If it was an older laptop and I had backups, I'd
</I>&gt;<i> be willing to 
</I>&gt;<i> risk it under the seat, but not on top of it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, my suggestion would be, keep backups, inform your users
</I>&gt;<i> that things 
</I>&gt;<i> really aren't all that secure yet, and use an older laptop
</I>&gt;<i> hidden under 
</I>&gt;<i> the seat. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
