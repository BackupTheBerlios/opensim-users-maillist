Ok now that i have a good clone all things running and prims fixed, i noticed
the way it was running. The 1st was something was causing bandwidth to be
used up. Not alot but constant. In my case the clients bandwith meter was
showing between 170 to 210kbps in consant use. As im at wire speed that
seemed really odd. So i checked that by going to the same stuff on the
sister grid and see if i had the same thing there and it wasent a problem.
Time to get out the lugwrench!  Now normaly i run this in sync. mode as it
worked best on the normal grid. Thinking that something is forming a loop
and knowing async would by design not allow it i tryed this line Normaly its 
'async_call_method = SmartThreadPool' but i changed it to this
'async_call_method = BeginInvoke'. After rebooting and being use to this
taking like 20min to reload again,now it took about 15min. Logged back in
thinking that got it! but all it seemed to do was make it reload faster,
bandwidth use was the same. Next line in the ini is usualy this
'use_async_when_possible = false' i change this to 'use_async_when_possible
= true' leaving the 1st line i changed 'async_call_method = BeginInvoke' as
it seemed to help a bit as far as the time it took to load the instance.
After another reload finnaly no more loop! Bandwidth showed 0kbps as it
normaly did on the non-megaregion version of it.
As i dident want to get into a bug hunt as to the why of it. I left it like
that. 
It seems to have caused no harm it also (other than the bandwidth problem)
dident gain any better performance. not noticable at wire speeds anyway. Im
shure it would impact web connected clients and if that happened for each
client that is logged on would prob. end up as bad thing. 
I am working on other tweeks but i thought that may be important to know
should someone run into that. Why my changes may not be the best ones it did
stop the loop.
A side note: When it was looping, i tryed a few things and found for some
resion when i sat in my car to drive around. the loop stoped untill i got
out and it started again. I tryed sitting on other things but only sitting
in the car broke the loop. Verry odd. After the changes, it dident matter
ether way so ill leave it at that. BTW all of this testing is in 32bit mode
and using the 32bit launcher not Opensim.exe.
