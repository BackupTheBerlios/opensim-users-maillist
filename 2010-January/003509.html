You seem to be jumping to conclusions.  How do you know that Seamonkey 
was denied because Seamonkey users are presumed bad?  Have you 
considered the business may have other reasons?  They may only want 
browsers accessing that they have tested their pages with thinking it 
will cut down on support calls?  Does Seamonkey on Linux support 
ActiveX?  Sometimes webpages tell you that you need ActiveX and sometime 
they only let in IE.  Mostly that tells me to do business somewhere 
else.  I don't see the need assume malice on anyone's part.
