<PRE>&quot;You also will find out alot of scripts are not running.. Some do need
reset.
this also happens normaly and took a good part of day to reset them.&quot;

Am I incorrect or isn't there an option in the viewer to &quot;reset all scripts&quot;
within a region?  I'm certain I'd seen that in the past.  Even then, not
sure if that would work correctly given this situation, but it's worth a
try.  I think maybe it's accessible through Ctrl-Alt-D (in Second Life
viewer) to reveal Admin Menu function then &quot;Enable Admin&quot; option on that
menu.  Correct me if I'm wrong...

</I>&gt;<i> As i mentioned in the 1st post. This is your last chance to check things.
</I>&gt;<i> What that ment is i found it tobe a one way trip. Once you atcualy combine
</I>&gt;<i> all the regions with all the prims ect. and think well i can just switch it
</I>&gt;<i> back and fix it after you would be doing better than i did. When i tryed
</I>&gt;<i> that i ended up not able to fix the problem's and actualy eneded up
</I>&gt;<i> scraping
</I>&gt;<i> all of it and start all over again!. I did find you can do that BUT only as
</I>&gt;<i> long as you have no objects on the regions yet. On the next go at it i
</I>&gt;<i> thought to make the blank.oar. I wanted to explore the problem a bit to see
</I>&gt;<i> if there may be away to still recover a region after the fact. So the
</I>&gt;<i> blank.oar is ment for that. When uncombined again i could load the blank
</I>&gt;<i> oar
</I>&gt;<i> for the offending region that makes shure whatever was on it it actualy
</I>&gt;<i> gone. But in all honesty that is a last resort and depending on whats wrong
</I>&gt;<i> you may not beable to recover it anyway. The clone in my case after i got
</I>&gt;<i> it
</I>&gt;<i> in my head this is a one way trip, came out tobe around 95% exact. I felt
</I>&gt;<i> that good enough considering the amount of total content. The remaining 5%
</I>&gt;<i> were mostly missing prims. As this is a clone and the orginal region was
</I>&gt;<i> just a tp away. It was a simple matter of getting the missing bits and
</I>&gt;<i> tping
</I>&gt;<i> back w. them fixing it. At 1st it will seem quite bad in performance and
</I>&gt;<i> thats mostly due to flotsum caching catching up to this mass of stuff. It
</I>&gt;<i> seems to take it a day or so to catch up. I allready knew this as the same
</I>&gt;<i> thing happens normaly. It will improve on its own. Its tempting at 1st to
</I>&gt;<i> think ohh i need to fiddle with ini settings to make it better, and found
</I>&gt;<i> that isant a good idea. Let the caching do what it was designed todo time
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> do it b4 you mess w. any settings! In my case it took it a few days to
</I>&gt;<i> fully
</I>&gt;<i> recreate the new cache data and things improved alot. I thought about
</I>&gt;<i> copying the cache from the orginal to the mega insatance, why thats sounds
</I>&gt;<i> ok in theroy i decided not to try that to be safe.
</I>&gt;<i> You also will find out alot of scripts are not running.. Some do need
</I>&gt;<i> reset.
</I>&gt;<i> this also happens normaly and took a good part of day to reset them. I did
</I>&gt;<i> that after i fixed any missing prims and why the caching is catching up
</I>&gt;<i> anyway. If i had the insite w. the orgianal regions to add in a reset on
</I>&gt;<i> rez
</I>&gt;<i> to the scripts in the 1st place i probably woulent have had to manualy do
</I>&gt;<i> that now but who knew if this was going to work at all.
</I>&gt;<i> Now the regions i cloned are the oldest part of my normal grid and being
</I>&gt;<i> that are the most developed. Some are more than a year old. I layed them
</I>&gt;<i> out
</I>&gt;<i> with roads and waterways homes, a small city and so on. The roadways go
</I>&gt;<i> thru
</I>&gt;<i> all of the regions and was done for the day when boarder crossing's work.
</I>&gt;<i> On
</I>&gt;<i> a megaregion this is not a problem, So that was also part of trying to
</I>&gt;<i> clone
</I>&gt;<i> what was allready done.
</I>&gt;<i> IF it worked i would also will have the rest in place at the same time.
</I>&gt;<i> Now after a a few days of letting it bake and fixing the minor stuff, i can
</I>&gt;<i> drive from the sw cornor of the mega to my home w. no problems. Quite fun
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> do the 1st time after wishing all this time :).
</I>&gt;<i> There are a few things to consider in all of this though and the main one
</I>&gt;<i> is
</I>&gt;<i> anyone tping there has to start from the sw region. I found some problems
</I>&gt;<i> where it is supose to force an incomming avie there but thats not allways
</I>&gt;<i> true and would look broken to ppl that no knowlage of it. So i used MRM
</I>&gt;<i> Tele-hub script to enshure this would happen, in fact i found it to be the
</I>&gt;<i> best way at this point. Its fast and has taken care of the few cases where
</I>&gt;<i> it woulent send them to the proper starting place. This ppl may find a bit
</I>&gt;<i> anoying becuase from there thay have to allways tp drive or walk to there
</I>&gt;<i> home or shop eachtime so you may want to consider that in your layout and
</I>&gt;<i> size. Given that user can now have the benifit of using cars and worn
</I>&gt;<i> scripts dont blow up on them ,made the having to start out in the same spot
</I>&gt;<i> each time worth it.
</I>&gt;<i> I had left the the SW region blank, it was the only one i dident restore an
</I>&gt;<i> oar to btw. That was the resion as it would be the spawn point for the
</I>&gt;<i> whole
</I>&gt;<i> thing and as i had nothing really made for it i left it empty for now. You
</I>&gt;<i> would want to make something like a welcome area or parking lot anyway.
</I>&gt;<i> I will be turning my eye on the settings, there are some settings that will
</I>&gt;<i> give you better perfornace in the case of a mega-region but are BAD for
</I>&gt;<i> normal region's! As this is a oneway trip with this instance, i will update
</I>&gt;<i> this with what i find in the way of ini tweeks as related to this test.
</I>&gt;<i> Some
</I>&gt;<i> settings i allready know help. But i strongly suggest not to asume there is
</I>&gt;<i> a one size fits all with them.
