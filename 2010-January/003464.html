<PRE>I suppose the way to disprove this would be to compile a version of the &quot;genuine&quot; Linden Labs viewer with all content checking disabled and the capability to do some sort of nastiness then distribute it to all the script kiddies somehow.

I am sure there are people out there who will do (or have done) exactly that, but it will not be me even to prove a point. A quick look at the code says it should be about a half day's work, less if I reverse engineered some version of copybot.

In my estimation that makes the illusion that checking the ID exactly equivalent to illusion presented by a dummy fire extinguisher. We just have not (yet) identified which &quot;genuine LL viewer&quot; is the really the fake!

In theory there is no difference between theory and practice, in practice there is!
