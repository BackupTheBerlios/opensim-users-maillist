</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Not fixing once problem is irresponsible. If you have this problem and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> spend time on the workaround I would call you stupid. You have done a

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ignoring the name calling....
</I>
The name calling was for someone that thinks that can secure a server
by blocking any kind of client. The server have to be secured on the
server side. It can never ever trust anything from the client.

&gt;<i> When one designs the server side of a system and finds a security flaw
</I>&gt;<i> in the client software that they did not write, then by your logic the
</I>&gt;<i> server has responsibility to block the client or shut down the service.
</I>&gt;<i>  That agrees with blocking you so vehemently reject.
</I>
If the client have a security problem, the client should be fixed. if
it's your own client you can use messaged to ask users to update, maybe
even deny them access untill they done so. If a bug in the cleint make
the server unsecure, then the server is unsecure and should be fixed.
The server can't be resposible for client security, the client can fix
server security. Whats happends on the other side of the internet your
side can't take resposibilty for.

&gt;<i> Exactly the point.  I use the word obscure the same way you do when you
</I>&gt;<i> said &quot;By makeing the knowledge some kind of long obsure string I made up
</I>&gt;<i> my self. It's much harder for someone else to figure this out and the
</I>&gt;<i> trust is me is me gets better&quot;
</I>
This is not the security by obsurity thou.


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Correct.  However some systems mix them.  The idea being that if access
</I>&gt;<i> is the only permission available then authorization and authentication
</I>&gt;<i> become a one to one correspondence.  I generally argue against this mixing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
You can't mix them, you maybe can do at the same time and you can have
bad schemsed for it. But as it totally differ functions and theoretical
functions you can't mix them really.


&gt;&gt;<i> Both models have there vaildity the problem with the layer idea is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> when it applied to stuff that easy can be added into a tool.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Checking a string is on easy end of the scale.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
The flaw, the big flaw in this model is that you asks the bad guys to
identify thems selfs. It's a bout as efficiant as a sign &quot;Bad guy's,
don't log in please.&quot;
