<PRE>I pretty much agree with you.  My objection is to the notion that 
&quot;fragile filtering&quot; is NOTHING or worse because it only generates safe 
feelings.  Lots of techniques have actual benefits that are not &quot;real 
security&quot; in some academic sense but are if you measure the effects.

Client ID string filtering is a poor example of a useful fragile filter. 
  1. The threshold for avoiding it is too low.  2. The cost of keeping 
legitimate users out is too high.
