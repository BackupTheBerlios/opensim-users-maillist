Part of the problem is that they also use tools like IRC and Twitter to brag about it too!

&gt;<i> Security is a balance between unusability (you don't want the attacker

</I>
There is another dimension to this balance, the value of what is being protected!

If your concern is merely that some halfwit will deface the system that requires a different balance from a system that contains proprietary software which is the total value of a company. Adding something like controls for remote drones (RPVs) alters that balance still further.

If security were simply a matter of applying some &quot;magic pixie dust&quot; then there would not be an ongoing discussion of the subject! Computer security is not a simple problem and there are no simple solutions.
