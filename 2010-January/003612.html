Yes it was done while in full grid mode ROBUST and MYSQL services. The
computer is lan connected to the GRID services and co-exist w. my public
grid. I dont think it matters that mutch as the the process of what i did
would still be the same. I havent tryed it in standalone mode, i think the
setps would be the same. You would need to be using MYSQL server and not on
the same box your running the instance on. Mysql will use alot of the
instance's resources and the instance needs every drop of computing power it
can get! Also you should not run your client on the same box as your
instance is on, not of this size anyway for the same resion.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have managed to clone 30 regions that are allready developed using OAR
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> copys. I thought there may be interest in the steps i took that worked.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The 1st thing i did was to layout a 5x6 mega region on its own instance.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Dont combine at this point. Use fresh region UUIDS and new names for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> each.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> then went and set each region's land settings and media settings as well
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the land textuers. I chose to do a terrain fill 23 as well. Note: Its
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> best
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to not set autoreturn at this point. The i made an oar i called blank.oar
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (With luck you wount ever need it).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2. Next was to restore the OARs i made of the regions i wanted to clone
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be part of the megaregion. (30 in this case). Restore them slowly making
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> shure the asset server keeps up with the OAR. Its tempting to rush but a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bad
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> idea as i found out on the 1st try of this!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3. Login and check each region carefully for any oops w. the oar restores
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (ignore ground textuers thay will end up changing to what you used in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1st step not what is in the oar after the instance is restarted as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> combined). At this point should you see anything wrong this is your last
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> change to fix it, if so simply reload the oar again or make a new one and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> resore (sometimes the OAR may not be right). Once i was shure all was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> well
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> i
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> shut the instance down and reloaded normaly. I did another quick check of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the regions. Remember this is your last chance to fix anything major! So
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> take your time and look.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 4. Shut it down again and change the setting in the ini. and restart
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it will take it about 5x longer than normal to load than it did normaly.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will see alot of errors about oject crossing boundrys for a bit (dont
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> panic). In my case the 30 regions held around 80k objects and a few K in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> scripts. Mixed bag of stuff from simple to complex objects. Eventualy the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> errors stop and a bit after finnishes the loading.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Its ok to log in at this point and have a look around, you will see
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> somethings may be missing or phantom
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that may not be case though. Alot of things can make it look like that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> realy there ok. Client cache and other things can make it seem like that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> too. The phntom prims are fixed w. a console command fix phantom objects.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Its a slow process in my case due to how many objects there are. In my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> case
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it did fix all the phantom stuff as well as missing prims (not shure why
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thay poped into view anyway).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I checked each region 1 by one noting any goof's down (verry minor ones
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> my case).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I shutdown the instance again. I clear my client cache and changed the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> instance caching from cermone to flotsum. I thought it best not to start
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> out
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with flotsum knowing this would be massive.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Restarted the instance (yes you will still see the object boundry
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> crossing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> errors and it still takes awhile to load it all).  By doing it in this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> order
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> i was happy to have a working 30region to 30sector MegaRegion.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There are alot of tweeks that should be done in the ini but thats another
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> post totaly.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There is a side effect to this if you still run your old regions that may
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have had parcles. Thay are Copyed not cloned! and will revert to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unparcled
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and back to the region owner. The clone's MEGAREGION parcles will be ok
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> though. Why that is im not shure yet.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As this was a TEST and dident actualy expect it to work at all. I was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> happy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with it. If anyone should try this Keep it in mind that theres 1000
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> things
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that can go wrong doing this and i am just saying what I did that gave ME
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> happy result.  Please feel free to add to this or any suggestions that i
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> may
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have glossed over here.
