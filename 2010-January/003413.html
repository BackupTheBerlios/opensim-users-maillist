<PRE>Hi Justin - Sounds like a great opportunity.  A couple of us are hoping to
come along.

How do we recognise you?  Presumably you will be the ones who look slightly
tilted, clothes noticeably pixelated at 512x512 and sitting around the table
at the back, with your feet slightly sunken into the floor  :~)

Kevin

Subject: [Opensim-users] Very Unofficial OpenSim London Meetup


Hi folks,

Darren Guard (founder of OpenSim, TribalMedia and developer for Rezzable),
Chris Hart (CTO of 
ReactionGrid) and myself, Justin Clark-Casey (OpenSim core developer,
freelancer, ex-IBM and Black 
Dress developer, notorious killjoy) recently began to talk about having a
face-to-face mini OpenSim 
meetup.

Since we're all in the UK (at the moment) we're going to meet in London at a
pub called &quot;The Jugged 
Hare&quot; near Victoria station.

172 Vauxhall Bridge Road
Victoria, SW1V 1DX
<A HREF="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the+jugged+hare%2C+london">http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the+jugged+hare%2C+london</A>

on Sunday 31st January 2010 between 12:30pm and 5:30pm.

Rather than just do this by ourselves, we thought it would be very cool to
open the invitation up to 
everybody, especially as it's more or less coincidental with OpenSim's 3rd
birthday!

This is going to be a very informal event - there won't be any banners or
formal presentations. 
It's really just a bunch of us sitting around talking about OpenSim and
virtual worlds.  Oh, and 
we'll be having a few beers too :)

So if you're interested or involved with OpenSim (or even other virtual
worlds/environments) in any 
way and want to come along we would be very pleased to see you!  Just show
up any time between 
12:30pm and 5:30pm or if you want us to look out for you, just tell us that
you're coming (by 
e-mail, blog post comment or any other way you like).  I'm sure we'll be
tweeting on the day too.

Until then, all the best!
