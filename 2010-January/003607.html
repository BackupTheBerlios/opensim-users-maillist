<PRE>
I have managed to clone 30 regions that are allready developed using OAR
copys. I thought there may be interest in the steps i took that worked.
The 1st thing i did was to layout a 5x6 mega region on its own instance.
Dont combine at this point. Use fresh region UUIDS and new names for each. I
then went and set each region's land settings and media settings as well as
the land textuers. I chose to do a terrain fill 23 as well. Note: Its best
to not set autoreturn at this point. The i made an oar i called blank.oar
(With luck you wount ever need it).
2. Next was to restore the OARs i made of the regions i wanted to clone and
be part of the megaregion. (30 in this case). Restore them slowly making
shure the asset server keeps up with the OAR. Its tempting to rush but a bad
idea as i found out on the 1st try of this!
3. Login and check each region carefully for any oops w. the oar restores
(ignore ground textuers thay will end up changing to what you used in the
1st step not what is in the oar after the instance is restarted as
combined). At this point should you see anything wrong this is your last
change to fix it, if so simply reload the oar again or make a new one and
resore (sometimes the OAR may not be right). Once i was shure all was well i
shut the instance down and reloaded normaly. I did another quick check of
the regions. Remember this is your last chance to fix anything major! So
take your time and look.
4. Shut it down again and change the setting in the ini. and restart
it will take it about 5x longer than normal to load than it did normaly. You
will see alot of errors about oject crossing boundrys for a bit (dont
panic). In my case the 30 regions held around 80k objects and a few K in
scripts. Mixed bag of stuff from simple to complex objects. Eventualy the
errors stop and a bit after finnishes the loading.
Its ok to log in at this point and have a look around, you will see
somethings may be missing or phantom 
that may not be case though. Alot of things can make it look like that but
realy there ok. Client cache and other things can make it seem like that
too. The phntom prims are fixed w. a console command fix phantom objects.
Its a slow process in my case due to how many objects there are. In my case
it did fix all the phantom stuff as well as missing prims (not shure why but
thay poped into view anyway).
I checked each region 1 by one noting any goof's down (verry minor ones in
my case).
I shutdown the instance again. I clear my client cache and changed the
instance caching from cermone to flotsum. I thought it best not to start out
with flotsum knowing this would be massive.
Restarted the instance (yes you will still see the object boundry crossing
errors and it still takes awhile to load it all).  By doing it in this order
i was happy to have a working 30region to 30sector MegaRegion.
There are alot of tweeks that should be done in the ini but thats another
post totaly.
There is a side effect to this if you still run your old regions that may
have had parcles. Thay are Copyed not cloned! and will revert to unparcled
and back to the region owner. The clone's MEGAREGION parcles will be ok
though. Why that is im not shure yet. 
As this was a TEST and dident actualy expect it to work at all. I was happy
with it. If anyone should try this Keep it in mind that theres 1000 things
that can go wrong doing this and i am just saying what I did that gave ME a
happy result.  Please feel free to add to this or any suggestions that i may
have glossed over here.
