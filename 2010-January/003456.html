You take issue with my analogy which I will admit was overstated at least in part for the sake of brevity.

Still you miss my point which is that there are no such things as &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; viewers!

The original &quot;copybot&quot; (long before the name was coined) and various other potentially &quot;bad&quot; tools used the unaltered Linden Labs Viewer and Servers! They did their jobs as a form of &quot;smart proxy&quot; or in crypto terms a &quot;man in the middle&quot;. 

At the time both the LL Viewer and the server code was &quot;closed source&quot; and the intended use for the tools was to analyse the data stream to understand how the system worked.

Identifying the viewer thus really does NOTHING apart from &quot;feelgood&quot;!

Banning of viewers (ANY viewers!) is based on a false assumption.

Even the notorious &quot;copybot&quot; does have legitimate uses.

The problem is not the software, but how that software is used. 

You can build a house with a hammer or you can kill someone with it - the hammer is no different!
