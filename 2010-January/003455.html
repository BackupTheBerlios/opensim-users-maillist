No it's not totally false.  You condemn it by way of a false analogy.

In your analogy the &quot;fragile filtering&quot; is the equivalent of a dummy fire 
extinguisher.  Unlike dummy fire extinguishers which don't put out any fires, 
fragile filters, at least the one asked for, would actually block based on how 
a client identifies itself.  It does more then provide good feelings.  The 
situation is more analogous to equipping with too few fire extinguishers 
rather then fake ones.  I suggest you ask your local fire department if you 
would be better off with one fire extinguisher, a fake one, or none!

It's always a danger that a security technique gets assumed to or, worse, 
claimed to do more then it actually does.

John.
