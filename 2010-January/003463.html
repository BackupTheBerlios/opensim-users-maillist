No, just the clock off, and off by enough to keep NTP from updating it 
automatically.

With all do respect the first of your claims I responded to had been that 
using the ID string was worse then doing nothing.  Which is false.  Then you 
went with it does NOTHING apart from &quot;feelgood&quot;!  Which is also false.  Now 
its it does nothing to prevent an attack.  I mostly agree with that.  What it 
does do is limit a viewer based on how it identifies itself which is something 
and may be worth doing to some even if you disagree with that practice.  If 
one wants users to use a particular viewer this can be a good first step.  I 
say mostly because any attack that doesn't identify itself with a blessed ID 
string gets blocked.  It works this way no matter how many times you call that 
&quot;worse then nothing&quot;, &quot;feel good&quot; or plain &quot;nothing&quot;.

John.
