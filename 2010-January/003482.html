Yes, it does some good in the very ways I have already explained.  You 
call that nothing and yet complain about the something that is does. 
You seem to feel that violating a TOS by using an approved viewer is OK. 
  That just makes you a bad guy too.

&gt;&gt;<i> You point out that it takes some effort to change the string.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Effort that the &quot;good guys&quot; will perform, but the &quot;bad guys&quot; won't!
</I>
If that is true then the system is totality secure since it will keep 
out the pesky bad guys who wont put in the effort.

&gt;<i> If I want to produce a &quot;griefer&quot; or &quot;piracy&quot; tool there is absolutely
</I>&gt;<i> no reason to change the IDs, revision codes or anyt6hing else apart
</I>&gt;<i> from whatever hack I am performing.
</I>
If a grid blocks on the ID codes that tool had better include an 
acceptable ID code.  Do you see being blocked as a reason for your tool 
to change codes?

&gt;<i> The ID strings are in the code, not automatically generated by Visual
</I>&gt;<i> Studio 2005!
</I>
Who said that?

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Which makes the check essentially useless as a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> security tool.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That assumes keeping out all bad guys is the only measure of a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> security tool.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have seen no other claim made for checking this ID string, nor can

</I>&gt;<i> competitor.
</I>
Exclude some buggy viewer that crashes your grid; exclude a viewer that 
has some aggressive behaviour (the GreenLife folks work with LL to 
prevent bad things when so many people upgrade); limit viewer to those 
you want test on your grid; version control perhaps? or ......

So, by NOTHING, you really mean nothing YOU approve of.

&gt;&gt;<i> I see.  Your choice of viewer is more important then the grid
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> operators choices.  It's OK to limit their tools.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That depends entirely on why they are operating the grid. If their
</I>&gt;<i> intent is to promote the sale of their particular viewer (or
</I>&gt;<i> whatever) then you are correct.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However if the grid operator is trying to actually attract casual
</I>&gt;<i> users and to make the grid useful to a reasonable number of people
</I>&gt;<i> then it is counter productive.
</I>
You seem to feel that your choice is more important then the grid 
operator's choice.  We disagree.
