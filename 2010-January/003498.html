</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    1. The threshold for avoiding it is too low. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2. The cost of keeping legitimate users out is too high.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;<i> That we certainly agree on!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This particular example would require the &quot;bad guys&quot; to actually change something to identify themselves!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since our last email exchange I have found one &quot;private&quot; so called &quot;backup&quot; system that actually allows the user to select form a set of viewer identities that is maintained by the client writer! This feature actually allows the &quot;script kiddie&quot; user to select which viewer identity is sent and presumably also includes some sort of index to show which identity to use with which grid!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Once I can confirm this (with at least more than some You Tube bragging) I will post some details.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      I have read most all of the comments concerning this issue. IMO viewer identification will just be a hassle to the user. Earlier today I used a Seamonkey browser and was prevented from transacting business because of using it. My desire to use a particular browser, Seamonkey, was denied. I certainly didn't want to harm the company that owned or hosted the website. I guess since Seamonkey is used by more Linux/Unix users that all Seamonkey users are up to no good and deserve to be banned. My point is to ban based to ID strings that are true or false is guilt by association just as it is in the above analogy for Seamonkey users.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I know the points taken in this very long discussion thread are towards trying to come up with a proactive approach to Opensim security. I don't think there is a proactive approach that will work well. I think it must be a reactive approach. If someone offends, ban. But, automation can certainly help with identification and culling bad doers.
</I>
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I propose that the ID of the offensive party be based on the MAC address that I think is part of the HTTP header, if not, there are trace back procedures that will reveal it. Then, maybe a database of offending MAC's could be established and keyed inversely with number of bans across Opensims.
</I>&gt;<i> The worst offenders are on top of the stack.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Representatives from several OS organizations could form a group to maintain the database and  it could be built into OS. Then all of opensim would be doing the same thing. The database could be replicated has a background process so that all have close the same data at some point. This approach uses a hardware/frimware address that can only be changed with a great deal of work or by going to another computer. This is not guilt by association but identification of hardware from wince bad deeds have come. I suppose someone with low level knowledge could send the header through a buffer and change the MAC address on the way out but, I don't think it would be successful as most ISP's use it to identify authorized equipment attached to their network.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for reading.
