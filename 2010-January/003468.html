What would this prove?  I think it would prove that one would have to 
use a client that identifies itself with a blessed ID.

You must have lots of spare time to call a half day's work NOTHING.

</I>
The broken analogy again....  What fire does a dummy fire extinguisher 
put out?  Blocking based on ID will block any client with the wrong ID. 
  It will let any client in with a correct ID even an undesirable one. 
I find it painfully amusing that on one hand you call this nothing and 
on another complain how it hurts good users.  If its nothing how can it 
hurt good users?
