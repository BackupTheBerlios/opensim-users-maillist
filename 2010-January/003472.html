If a grid operator only wants a particular viewer connected to their 
grid and you connect with an alternate are you a good guy or a bad guy? 
  I say you are a bad guy.  If blocking based on the ID string keeps you 
out I wanted you out anyway!  Keeping bad guys out as well as slowing 
them down definitionally improves security.  Does this make the system 
&quot;secure&quot; from bad guys and all attacks?  Nope, I don't recall anyone 
saying so.

Really, do all clients send bad ID strings?  I did not know that.  I 
appear to be under the mistaken impression that clients generally use 
that ID string to identify themselves.  Are you who you say you are? 
Can I determine if that's really you and not someone else?  Is it OK to 
accept that you are who you say because you have said so?

Mailing lists commonly require one to be a member to post to the list. 
Why?  I can spoof any email address.  That's not secure.  I guess we 
should stop because we wouldn't want anyone to falsely feel safe. :-)

&gt;&gt;<i> its it does nothing to prevent an attack.  I mostly agree with that.  What it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> does do is limit a viewer based on how it identifies itself which is something
</I>&gt;<i> What it does is chaning the protocol for connecting a little making your

</I>
I support you choosing what grids you connect to.  I also support a grid 
operator making decisions about their grid.
