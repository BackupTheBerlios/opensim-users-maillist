<PRE>For me, I am more or less curious not in your Regions.ini file.. but your
OpenSim.ini and OpenSim.Server.ini if your running in Grid mode. someday I
have a dream of running Grid mode with hyperGrid turned on..  hahahaha

</I>&gt;<i> I have managed to clone 30 regions that are allready developed using OAR
</I>&gt;<i> copys. I thought there may be interest in the steps i took that worked.
</I>&gt;<i> The 1st thing i did was to layout a 5x6 mega region on its own instance.
</I>&gt;<i> Dont combine at this point. Use fresh region UUIDS and new names for each.
</I>&gt;<i> I
</I>&gt;<i> then went and set each region's land settings and media settings as well as
</I>&gt;<i> the land textuers. I chose to do a terrain fill 23 as well. Note: Its best
</I>&gt;<i> to not set autoreturn at this point. The i made an oar i called blank.oar
</I>&gt;<i> (With luck you wount ever need it).
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Next was to restore the OARs i made of the regions i wanted to clone and
</I>&gt;<i> be part of the megaregion. (30 in this case). Restore them slowly making
</I>&gt;<i> shure the asset server keeps up with the OAR. Its tempting to rush but a
</I>&gt;<i> bad
</I>&gt;<i> idea as i found out on the 1st try of this!
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Login and check each region carefully for any oops w. the oar restores
</I>&gt;<i> (ignore ground textuers thay will end up changing to what you used in the
</I>&gt;<i> 1st step not what is in the oar after the instance is restarted as
</I>&gt;<i> combined). At this point should you see anything wrong this is your last
</I>&gt;<i> change to fix it, if so simply reload the oar again or make a new one and
</I>&gt;<i> resore (sometimes the OAR may not be right). Once i was shure all was well
</I>&gt;<i> i
</I>&gt;<i> shut the instance down and reloaded normaly. I did another quick check of
</I>&gt;<i> the regions. Remember this is your last chance to fix anything major! So
</I>&gt;<i> take your time and look.
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Shut it down again and change the setting in the ini. and restart
</I>&gt;<i> it will take it about 5x longer than normal to load than it did normaly.
</I>&gt;<i> You
</I>&gt;<i> will see alot of errors about oject crossing boundrys for a bit (dont
</I>&gt;<i> panic). In my case the 30 regions held around 80k objects and a few K in
</I>&gt;<i> scripts. Mixed bag of stuff from simple to complex objects. Eventualy the
</I>&gt;<i> errors stop and a bit after finnishes the loading.
</I>&gt;<i> Its ok to log in at this point and have a look around, you will see
</I>&gt;<i> somethings may be missing or phantom
</I>&gt;<i> that may not be case though. Alot of things can make it look like that but
</I>&gt;<i> realy there ok. Client cache and other things can make it seem like that
</I>&gt;<i> too. The phntom prims are fixed w. a console command fix phantom objects.
</I>&gt;<i> Its a slow process in my case due to how many objects there are. In my case
</I>&gt;<i> it did fix all the phantom stuff as well as missing prims (not shure why
</I>&gt;<i> but
</I>&gt;<i> thay poped into view anyway).
</I>&gt;<i> I checked each region 1 by one noting any goof's down (verry minor ones in
</I>&gt;<i> my case).
</I>&gt;<i> I shutdown the instance again. I clear my client cache and changed the
</I>&gt;<i> instance caching from cermone to flotsum. I thought it best not to start
</I>&gt;<i> out
</I>&gt;<i> with flotsum knowing this would be massive.
</I>&gt;<i> Restarted the instance (yes you will still see the object boundry crossing
</I>&gt;<i> errors and it still takes awhile to load it all).  By doing it in this
</I>&gt;<i> order
</I>&gt;<i> i was happy to have a working 30region to 30sector MegaRegion.
</I>&gt;<i> There are alot of tweeks that should be done in the ini but thats another
</I>&gt;<i> post totaly.
</I>&gt;<i> There is a side effect to this if you still run your old regions that may
</I>&gt;<i> have had parcles. Thay are Copyed not cloned! and will revert to unparcled
</I>&gt;<i> and back to the region owner. The clone's MEGAREGION parcles will be ok
</I>&gt;<i> though. Why that is im not shure yet.
</I>&gt;<i> As this was a TEST and dident actualy expect it to work at all. I was happy
</I>&gt;<i> with it. If anyone should try this Keep it in mind that theres 1000 things
</I>&gt;<i> that can go wrong doing this and i am just saying what I did that gave ME a
</I>&gt;<i> happy result.  Please feel free to add to this or any suggestions that i
</I>&gt;<i> may
</I>&gt;<i> have glossed over here.
