<PRE>You are quite correct in saying that the traffic camera comments belong elsewhere! Sorry.

<A HREF="http://camerafraud.wordpress.com/">http://camerafraud.wordpress.com/</A> is a website devoted to this issue and is the appropriate place for any more discussion.

I will merely note that so far 11 states have banned the cameras and 17 out of 17 ballots on the issue have also done so.

I do agree with your comments on the ID string, although I have other posts which cover my thoughts in more detail.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ...until you issue a challenge like that. Further, the
</I>&gt;<i> 'default ID' can be changed *on the commandline*. Because of
</I>&gt;<i> this, there's no requirement to recompile/relink the viewer
</I>&gt;<i> when you want to change that ID string, which reduces (by
</I>&gt;<i> several orders of magnitude) the amount of time necessary to
</I>&gt;<i> brute-force the string necessary. And, since you've
</I>&gt;<i> essentially stated that you want the &quot;official&quot; Linden
</I>&gt;<i> viewer, all someone has to do is figure out which version
</I>&gt;<i> string(s) of the released viewer your grid will accept.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If you want security through obscurity, that's
</I>&gt;<i> wonderful... but when you make it no longer obscure, it's no
</I>&gt;<i> longer secure. You have definitely removed the obscurity
</I>&gt;<i> from your system through your announcement of your plans in
</I>&gt;<i> this thread.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have already stated the only even-remotely-secure
</I>&gt;<i> way to do it, and even that, if you want any kind of grid
</I>&gt;<i> population at all, is going to require some kind of
</I>&gt;<i> automation. (That way is server/client mutual cryptographic
</I>&gt;<i> authentication, handled via TLS.) Personally, I'd rather
</I>&gt;<i> each change to a primitive be written to a log as a
</I>&gt;<i> revertable changeset... but I'll let you know when I figure
</I>&gt;<i> out how to do that.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; There are a great many crazy ideas that hide under
</I>&gt;<i> the banner of &quot;security&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Here in Arizona we have a traffic camera scam
</I>&gt;<i> which is being promoted as &quot;safety&quot;. The huge amount of
</I>&gt;<i> statistical evidence which proves this to be false is simply
</I>&gt;<i> ignored.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Traffic cameras have been held unconstitutional in the
</I>&gt;<i> state of California. I used to live in Arizona; I pity that
</I>&gt;<i> you do.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The problem that those traffic cameras were supposed
</I>&gt;<i> to stop can be resolved, much more effectively, by
</I>&gt;<i> increasing the length of the yellow light to at least 2
</I>&gt;<i> seconds. The bigger problem is that most city councils were
</I>&gt;<i> convinced that it could be a revenue-generation system, and
</I>&gt;<i> thus most councils directed that yellow lights be shortened,
</I>&gt;<i> thus increasing the danger of entering an intersection in
</I>&gt;<i> the first two seconds after a green light.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Many people are receiving citations for speeding
</I>&gt;<i> when in fact they are sick or travelling outside the US.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ...which is why they've been held unconstitutional in
</I>&gt;<i> CA. (As has photo-radar, since the operator of the vehicle
</I>&gt;<i> is the one responsible for the violation -- not the owner or
</I>&gt;<i> registered owner of the vehicle used for the violation.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Karen
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The point is to identify the end result of what you
</I>&gt;<i> want, and you've identified it as &quot;I don't want anyone
</I>&gt;<i> fucking with the prims on my grid unless I grant them
</I>&gt;<i> permission.&quot; You have generalized this to &quot;I don't want
</I>&gt;<i> anyone I can't trust not to fuck with the prims on my grid
</I>&gt;<i> to connect to my grid,&quot; and are now trying to find a way to
</I>&gt;<i> enforce that. We've all told you *why* your approach is
</I>&gt;<i> flawed. We've all told you *how* your approach is flawed.
</I>&gt;<i> We've even tried to provide you with *better directions* to
</I>&gt;<i> find the solution to your problem.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; All the while, you've been stubbornly refusing to
</I>&gt;<i> accept any solution more complex than the not-a-solution
</I>&gt;<i> that you've come up with, and have been vocally defending
</I>&gt;<i> something that, to be effective, must be kept secret. (Since
</I>&gt;<i> it's no longer a secret, it no longer has any effectiveness.
</I>&gt;<i> Congratulations on shooting yourself in the foot.)
