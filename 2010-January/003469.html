If one takes a step that thwarts an attack, has security been improved? 
  I say it has.  Does thwarting an attack make a system secure?  Not 
necessarily.

If you have stupidly written a web site that only securely works with 
one browser should you try to restrict access to your web site to that 
one browser?

&gt;&gt;<i> So, is the system secure?  If one's goal was to prevent casual

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> prevent anyone from ever running a bad client on their grid then one's

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Security through obscurity&quot; is quite valid.  That's why we (hopefully)

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A good random passphase is not security by obsurity.
</I>
If a password is not obscured it's not effective.  If I can guess it or 
figure it out it's not secure.  The very point of a password is for 
others not to know it.  The more obscure it is to others the more secure 
it is.  The security relies on this very obscurity.

 &gt; It's a part of authentication of the user.
 &gt; In security reserach one have identified
&gt;<i> three elemetrs thet is needed for an authenitcation of a person.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;ownership&quot;, &quot;knowledge&quot; and &quot;inherence&quot;. The passphase is the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;knowledge&quot; part, the harder something is to know the better thius leg
</I>&gt;<i> of authentication. For example we couls say it you in phone can state
</I>&gt;<i> when year you are born, I think you are you. This knowledge is quite
</I>&gt;<i> easy for someone else to figure out so this leg is quite easy to break.
</I>&gt;<i> By makeing the knowledge some kind of long obsure string I made up my
</I>&gt;<i> self. It's much harder for someone else to figure this out and the trust
</I>&gt;<i> is me is me gets better, Still is just the knowledge element. To make a
</I>&gt;<i> good authentication one need atleast two elements. verifying the two
</I>&gt;<i> other elements of authenitcation over the internet is almost impossible
</I>&gt;<i> even if some atemts have been done.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The passphase only lets you to some extent be sure of the person in the
</I>&gt;<i> other end is the person he or she clames to be. It have nothing with
</I>&gt;<i> securing what he or she can do.
</I>
Determining who can do what is often called authorization.

&gt;&gt;<i> I think having lots of easy to setup and use layers is a good thing even
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> when some of them are easily defeated. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The big risk is that no security chain is stronger that it's weakest
</I>&gt;<i> link. And having a loot of staong links in one part makes the user feel
</I>&gt;<i> secure. Feeling secure whan one isn't could be fatal.
</I>
I think of security in terms of layers not chains.  If one technique is 
subject to spoofing or man-in-the-middle attack I may need to add other 
layers.  I don't necessarily stop using those techniques because they don't.

John.
