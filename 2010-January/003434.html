<PRE>Mostly I want this because of piece of mind, but also because I am 
considering compiling a viewer on Hippo code that will have a different 
channel code altogether that I will probably use for the sim. If I can lock 
off viewers that don't have my exact channel or code then I can be sure only 
official viewers can get in. Right now the sim is only for friends but if I 
open it up to more I wouldn't want idiots coming in and mucking about the 
place. Which is why I was asking. I know that some opensim *shaking head* I 
wish I could remember who and where banned certain viewers from logging in. 
I'm not sure how she/he did it, though, but it got me curious as to how it's 
done. That and I wouldn't really want someone using something like Cryo or 
even Meerkat, but as you said... They probably all have the same default 
code. But if I put in another code and compiled it off of hippo or Linden's 
viewer I could put in my own channel and have others not able to enter. I 
like security and peace of mind, but security in this day and age is a myth. 
(Like those stupid broadcasting things that were supposed to stop copybot.)

But I was just curious if anyone had done it or heard of it. I want to say 
openlifegrid did it, but I can't remember so I don't want to say for sure 
until I find it again. (computer crashes suck.)

&gt;<i> As I think of it the answer is the same.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Linden Labs viewer does send an identification and version number, bat 
</I>&gt;<i> that really does very little. Almost every viewer out there is based on 
</I>&gt;<i> the current LL viewer and many people don't bother changing this code for 
</I>&gt;<i> their experimental versions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For example I just checked and I have a customised LL viewer where the 
</I>&gt;<i> only change is that it will log on to my private sim by default. The ID 
</I>&gt;<i> codes are identical to the original since I never bothered to change them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I use it to make sure that my private sim will run OK with the &quot;official&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> viewer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am not really sure why you would want that restriction though. Should I 
</I>&gt;<i> be considering that for my sim? Have I missed something here?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I don't think anyone is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> understanding. :D It's not just Cryo. I want only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Linden Lab viewers to be able to login. I've seen it done
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> opensim's. I know people can get around that. But the point
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is... Not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> everyone is a coder. So, while they could compile and make
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it look like a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Linden Lab viewer then so be it. I just want to know if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there's a mod or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> string that I can put in to opensim to see what channel the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> viewer is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sending, and if it's not the right one than to display an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> error message that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would tell them to download an official release in order to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> login.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Maybe I should have chosen my words better. Mentioning Cryo
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mentioning copybot, and responses only seem to be based on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> theft and copy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> protection. I just want to know if there's a string to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> block a viewer. I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> know people have done it I just can't remember what opensim
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I saw it done
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on. I also know that if I had Cryo source code I could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> compile and make it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> look like a Second Life release viewer. But not everyone is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a hacker or a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> coder or both. Most people don't know how or can't compile
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a viewer or are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> too lazy to. So, they go look for one, and that's the basis
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for my thinking
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> most theives are too lazy to try to figure out a way and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will move on to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> next target.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So, the question I'm asking is:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is there a way for OpenSim to check a viewer string and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> allow or disallow
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> based on that, and if so please let me know where that code
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is, and if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not... Then I'll be burning the midnight oil again coding
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one up.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; The short answer is no.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; The more complete answer is that you while can easily
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> detect some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; characteristic of a viewer (or other software) which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> identifies that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; viewer and use that to ban it, nothing can stop the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> authors of that viewer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; from changing whatever characteristic you use.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Worse yet, whatever characteristic you select to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> identify the &quot;bad&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; software will inevitably turn up in some other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (innocent) viewer sooner or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; later and will cause them to be banned for no reason.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; The best you could hope to achieve is some sort of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;arms race&quot; between
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;bad&quot; viewer creators and sim operators.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; In addition any viewer could be adapted for piracy.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The original
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; experiments that resulted in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> libsecondlife/openMetaverse were based on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; analysing the data stream between the Second Life
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Servers and the viewer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; software (at the time ONLY the Linden Labs viewer) and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> had access to all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; of that information. This was all done without
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> modifying the viewer in any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; way - it was proprietary at the time.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Sadly the lesson of the endless failures of DRM
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> schemes elsewhere shows
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; that the real losers are the honest/innocent users who
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are unable to do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; the things that they really should expect to do with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the content that they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; have purchased.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; For example, I have completely stopped buying anything
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in Second Life
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; since I want to use the inventory I buy in my private
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sims as well. Sure I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; can use pirate tools to do this, but if I have to do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that to use my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; purchases where I want to use them then why not just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> steal the stuff in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; the first place?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; This is very similar to the situation with music CDs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and DVDs, why build
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; an expensive collection if you will just have to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> re-purchase it in a few
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; years for the next technology and some DRM scheme
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tries to keep me from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; playing my collection on the new equipment?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; There are several efforts being directed at come sort
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of &quot;portable&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; content. I hope that one or more actually proves to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> work, but I have no
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; illusions about that actually happening any time
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> soon.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; My opinion is that the best we can do at present is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> similar to the real
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; life piracy situation: stop the commercial marketing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of pirated
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; merchandise as it is detected and reported. Ban anyone
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> who engages in such
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; activities and if they persist bring real world law
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> enforcement to bear.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; For once Linden Labs seems to be using a reasonable
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> version of this when
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; they state that the viewer is not the problem, it is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the use of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; viewer. They have promised to act promptly to ban
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> anyone using any viewer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; for piracy.
