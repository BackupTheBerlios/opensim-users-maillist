I guess I missed that in the diatribe.

&gt;<i> Identifying the viewer thus really does NOTHING apart from &quot;feelgood&quot;!
</I>
I understand that you see this as nothing.  We disagree on this point.  Not 
being effective against a man-in-the-middle attack is not equivalent to doing 
nothing.  Lots of security measures can be defeated by such attacks.  We still 
make use of such techniques and layer them with others to shore up those 
deficiencies.

&gt;<i> Banning of viewers (ANY viewers!) is based on a false assumption.
</I>
The false assumption is that a technique that doesn't solve all problems does 
nothing.

&gt;<i> The problem is not the software, but how that software is used.
</I>
This is true of security software too.
