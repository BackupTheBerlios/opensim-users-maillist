<PRE>
After a whole lot of back and forth (much of it in private emails) I think we are beginning to agree.

--- On Thu, 1/14/10, John Ward &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-users">jward at uci.edu</A>&gt; wrote:

My distinction is between what you plan to do as part of the system &quot;defense&quot; and what you are forced to do to keep things working and keep the &quot;bad guys&quot; from destroying things.

This is really a different &quot;plane&quot; from John's view expressed above, but I see it as complimentary rather than a contradiction.

&gt;<i> Client ID string filtering is a poor example of a useful
</I>&gt;<i> fragile filter. 
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; 1. The threshold for avoiding it is too low.&#160;

</I>
That we certainly agree on!

This particular example would require the &quot;bad guys&quot; to actually change something to identify themselves! 

Since our last email exchange I have found one &quot;private&quot; so called &quot;backup&quot; system that actually allows the user to select form a set of viewer identities that is maintained by the client writer! This feature actually allows the &quot;script kiddie&quot; user to select which viewer identity is sent and presumably also includes some sort of index to show which identity to use with which grid!

Once I can confirm this (with at least more than some You Tube bragging) I will post some details.
