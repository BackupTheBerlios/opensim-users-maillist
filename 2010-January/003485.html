<PRE>Well no it wasn't, it was derived from a BBC documentary that I recently viewed on the subject and it seemed appropriate illustration of the usefulness of security precautions as well as weapons.

It was NOT intended as any form of name calling, much less comparisoms with the abuses of the Nazi regime.

Sadly I have often had to break open the security of computer systems that I worked on simply to do the job that I was hired to do by the system owner. What was particularly annoying was to be told (afterwards) that what I did was impossible since the system was &quot;unbreakable&quot;!

I only hope that the quality of systems administration has improved since then, but I often wonder if we have actually advanced.

Just the same this thread has probably exhausted its usefulness for the moment.
