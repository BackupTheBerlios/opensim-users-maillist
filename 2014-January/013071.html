<PRE>The open metaverse seriously needs grid independent asset storage with
replication, failover and scalability.  Another approach is to tie assets
owned to the owner in some kind of per user cloud or local machine only
backed storage.  Or at least have such as backups.    It is an interesting
set of challenges - and opportunities.
