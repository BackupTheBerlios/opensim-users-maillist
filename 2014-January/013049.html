<PRE>there are ways to clean up assets... but its a lot of work and definitely
not perfect. in simian we have a last access time on every asset... that
means we can (for example) save an oar file for a region (with an empty
region cache) which will cause all the assets in the region to be touched.
you can do a similar walk through inventory for all users (iar backups of
all users inventories for example)... if you have control over all of your
regions (so you can run the oar file backups) then you can &quot;reasonably&quot;
safely delete assets that had not been touched recently. (reasonably in the
sense that you are trusting oars and iars to actually expand all the assets
completely.)

that being said... disks are cheaper.

one thing you can do in the short term for assets that are generated by
deleting objects..

the UseTrashOnDelete configuration flag, when set to false, will prevent
items deleted from the scene from ending up in your trash folder in
inventory. that means no assets will be created for them. it works cross
simulator, so be careful.
