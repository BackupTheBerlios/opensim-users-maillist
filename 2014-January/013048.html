Every grid running for a long time had faced the problem. Cleaning 
the assets has been discussed here and appears to be a complex task, 
involving parsing serialized objects, wearables, notecards and 
scripts. Melanie outlined the process here:

Although nobody proved that was theoretically impossible, nobody came 
with a practical solution. Yet.

Backing up by sqldump is not out of the question, you may keep a 
rolling set of snapshots for last day, week, mont, quarter... 
depending on you storage capacity.
