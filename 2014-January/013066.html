I noticed this (very worrying) comment in a discussion on tidying up 
growing asset data bases...

It will surely not be uncommon for grids to be tidied up, 
reinitialized, restored or to disappear entirely.

It ought not to be the case that any objects obtained with 
appropriate permission over a HG connection or visit can disappear 
from a grid they are currently on. If that is the way it is currently 
works we will have serious problems with builds disappearing or 
getting broken.  Do HG transferred objects rely on their continuing 
availability on the continuing availability and access to the 
origination grid?  I certainly hope not... I would expect a standa 
lonw copy that can exist independently to be available on the 
destination grid forever independently of the origination grid availability.

Can someone who knows the protocol comment and reassure us that all 
is well in HG asset transfer land?  Maybe Diva could comment?  We can 
then report bugs in what is meant to happen if items are disappearing 
for some users when the origination grid is changed or lost.
