They don't. Once rezed or given in HG, objects and assets belong to 
the destination grid db. They are copies that can exist independently.

I build in HG on a grid which has been backuped/restored many times, 
even when the originating grid was down, and I never lost one of my 
object. However, I loose ownership each time. Once restored, they 
belong to the master avatar.

In a 6000-prim collaborative build, this is a nightmare. We have been 
able to fool the permission manager by creating a local user with 
same uuid as the HG user _before_ loading the OAR.
