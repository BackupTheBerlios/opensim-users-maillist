Dear colleagues,

A workshop on foreign language learning and teaching in virtual worlds will be held in conjunction with The 20th International Conference on Computers in Education (ICCE 2012--see <A HREF="http://www.lsl.nie.edu.sg/icce2012/">http://www.lsl.nie.edu.sg/icce2012/</A>), which will take place in Singapore from November 26 to November 30, 2012. ICCE is a &quot;meta-conference&quot; consisting of seven interrelated sub-conferences, each of which has a specialized theme and is overseen by its own program committee.

The Call for Papers for the ICCE 2012 workshop on &quot;Real Education in Virtual Worlds: Foreign Language Learning and Teaching&quot; is available at the following URL:

<A HREF="http://bit.ly/LW4VON">http://bit.ly/LW4VON</A>

As per the Call, manuscripts of 4-8 pages in length should be submitted to the Workshop Chair, Dr. Yu-Ju Lan, via email at <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-users">icce2012.revw.llt at gmail.com</A> no later than August 19, 2012, following which they will be subject to double-blind peer review. Authors will be notified as to the outcome of the review process no later than September 2, 2012, and thereafter, those whose manuscripts have been accepted will have until October 2, 2012 to submit final, camera-ready versions for inclusion in the Proceedings. The Proceedings will be indexed by Elsevier for inclusion in a number of its bibliographic databases, including Scopus.
