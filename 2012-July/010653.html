<PRE>One of the problems that user content generation faces in general is that
while it is fairly simple to re-use or re-adapt existing content, most
users who are creating the derived content are not familiar with DMCA
rules. Also sometimes DMCA rules can be crippling ... once I was making a
video clip of myself explaining some yoga exercises and had a music playing
the background. After uploading the clip, I got a message from youtube
saying the clip has content that violates copyright ... so this got me
thinking. Say you are capturing a birthday on film and have some birthday
music in the background, the birthday music creators can sue you ...

Same thing for animations, even textures, sculpties etc... that you bought,
or was 'free' to download etc... may of the free stuff comes with their own
copyright constraints (read fine print), for e.g. Turbosquid now pretty
much prohibits the use of any of their content in Second Life/OpenSim even
for things that you want to fully pay for. I ran into this issue when there
was some content that I want to buy, was asked where I wanted to use it,
and as soon as I mentioned SL/opensim, was told it was not allowed. Spend a
lot of time trying to pry an explanation, all I got is some whimsical
statement that SL/Opensim do not support 'proprietary content' ... I still
do not understand what this means in fact.

So now, I have a completely take on content production in virtual
environments. It is damn expensive to do it. Problem is people cannot pay
for what it actually costs to produce them. If you earn a salary of say 5
dollar per hour, just doing a simple texture properly from your own
pictures etc... can easily take a couple of hours.  Just imagine how much
other things would cost ... animations and so forth.

I think the problem is a much bigger one that meets the eye. You have to
make every effort to navigate this difficult problem ... it is really easy
to inadvertently use something you are not supposed to it. All in all,
looks like you've got to redo everything from scratch ... would be
interested to see what others think about this.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> okay, this is the second post.  Here is what I am getting at.  Stroker,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> creator of SexGen open sourced and gave full permissions to do whatever
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with his creations when he left SL.  There was some dispute by his
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> partners, but they made a script that removes all the disputed animations.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Obviously, I can copy text for the scripts, but I would like to move the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> animations to my personal grid.  I can see no way to do this.  I don't see
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> any moral or legal issues as he was very clear as to his intent to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> completely open source it and I have removed the disputed animations - but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> without the original files, it is no longer possible to export animations
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> even that have full perms that I know of if you are not the creator.  I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> didn't want to say this because of the whole judgement/sex angle, but what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the heck.  Is there any solution to get those animations out of SL.  I am
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sure I am not the only one interested in this - I don't plan to profit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (though I could by the terms of his release), just want to use them in a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> grid outside of SL.  And there are other objects that fall into this same
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> category - person leaves SL, opens it, but without the original files, you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can't move them out of SL anymore.  Thoughts?  Thanks,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Drew
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There's a couple important concepts about animations and licenses...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First...Full Perm on Second Life  does NOT mean you are &quot;allowed&quot; to
</I>&gt;<i> export them to any other grid.
</I>&gt;<i>     Many SL animators specifically PROHIBIT use of their creations on
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim based grids.
</I>&gt;<i>     A lot of the sculpty makers do the same thing...   you are welcome to
</I>&gt;<i> buy full perm on SL grid, but you MAY NOT export the shapes.
</I>&gt;<i>     Since you brought up Stroker as an example...you are also aware that
</I>&gt;<i> what someone says/thinks a license says
</I>&gt;<i>     SOMETIMES isn't what the creator specified...  Rather than putting
</I>&gt;<i> yourself and the grid operator in the position
</I>&gt;<i>     of answering DCMA demands, you might limit your Grid imports to the
</I>&gt;<i> objects with clear titles.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Second...  The process of uploading the BVH animation file modifies the
</I>&gt;<i> result into a form designed to send to viewers..
</I>&gt;<i>     Animations differ from almost every other form of in-world object, in
</I>&gt;<i> that you cant re-create it from the packets required to display it in a
</I>&gt;<i> viewer,
</I>&gt;<i>     I'm pretty sure the effort it would take to reverse engineer the BVH
</I>&gt;<i> file from the animation info &quot;users&quot; have access to...
</I>&gt;<i>     and probability of legal consequences have been deterrents to
</I>&gt;<i> development of such a utility.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That said... there are animators who are willing to provide the BVH format
</I>&gt;<i> files for upload to whatever grid will accept them,
</I>&gt;<i> but you will find that they expect you to pay them FULL price..   For
</I>&gt;<i> example...  a marketplace search led to
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://inf-designs.com/..">http://inf-designs.com/..</A> selling sets of 12-15 couple animations for
</I>&gt;<i> about 60 USD.  ( disclaimer.. this was just
</I>&gt;<i> an exercise in finding &quot;market prices&quot;.. I am NOT recommending them as a
</I>&gt;<i> source of animations... )
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While the new advances in Motion Capture via Kinect promise to reduce the
</I>&gt;<i> cost of generating &quot;custom&quot; animations,
</I>&gt;<i> the current costs of  motion capture studio time (thousand of dollars for
</I>&gt;<i> recording/editing/formatting a 30 second animation)
</I>&gt;<i> make it unlikely that creators will be sympathetic to requests to allow
</I>&gt;<i> uploading to grids that cannot provide any real form of copy protection.
</I>&gt;<i>
