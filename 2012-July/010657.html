<PRE>Thanks for the all the info.  I consider myself pretty well versed in IP
law (15 years of being a IP lawyer legal secretary) and I am very careful
to follow those laws and do respect them.  When I approach creaters in SL,
I specifically get rights to grids outside of SL.  In Stroker's case this
was not possible as he cut himself off.  I believe I have most of the
&quot;Stroker&quot; story and there was a lot of controversy but that deals with his
partnership and they only claim ownership to animations.  If you see a
SexGen with 600 anims, then it is in dispute and no one should touch it.
They did make a script to strip out the disputed anims, leaving about 300
which fall under Stroker's legal authority.  It is a bit grey, relying on
forum postings, etc., but from what I can tell, stroker's are okay to
export (legally if not practically).  At any rate, I really do want to
bring them to just my personal grid, so I doubt it would become an issue.
I don't plan on bringing them to OSGrid, or something.  Though, if you are
into those things, these are 300 quality animations, plus a lot of objects
and a complex script.  It certainly would be interesting just for testing
purposes to see how it all worked on an OpenSim grid, which is also my
motivation.  Thanks,

Drew

</I>&gt;<i> I am afraid the details on your specific case don't change the global
</I>&gt;<i> concept.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As said earlier, the &quot;full perms&quot; notion only applies inside Second Life.
</I>&gt;<i> If the creator allowed using content in other grids, it's up to the creator
</I>&gt;<i> to publish his content outside.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, please verify carefully Stroker's statement. If he did not
</I>&gt;<i> mention explicitly that content can be used outside Second Life, SL terms
</I>&gt;<i> of service do apply and you can't.
</I>&gt;<i> Additionally, be aware that Stroker faced several DMCA filings about this
</I>&gt;<i> content, so be careful about the version you want to use.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any solution to export content from Second Life (no matter the perms)
</I>&gt;<i> would be a violation of SL term of services, so there is no legal solution
</I>&gt;<i> to do that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That said, there are plenty of free animations available on the web,
</I>&gt;<i> including anims for things like sexgen.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Le 7 juil. 2012 &#224; 12:56, Dr Ramesh Ramloll a &#233;crit :
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One of the problems that user content generation faces in general is that
</I>&gt;<i> while it is fairly simple to re-use or re-adapt existing content, most
</I>&gt;<i> users who are creating the derived content are not familiar with DMCA
</I>&gt;<i> rules. Also sometimes DMCA rules can be crippling ... once I was making a
</I>&gt;<i> video clip of myself explaining some yoga exercises and had a music playing
</I>&gt;<i> the background. After uploading the clip, I got a message from youtube
</I>&gt;<i> saying the clip has content that violates copyright ... so this got me
</I>&gt;<i> thinking. Say you are capturing a birthday on film and have some birthday
</I>&gt;<i> music in the background, the birthday music creators can sue you ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Same thing for animations, even textures, sculpties etc... that you
</I>&gt;<i> bought, or was 'free' to download etc... may of the free stuff comes with
</I>&gt;<i> their own copyright constraints (read fine print), for e.g. Turbosquid now
</I>&gt;<i> pretty much prohibits the use of any of their content in Second
</I>&gt;<i> Life/OpenSim even for things that you want to fully pay for. I ran into
</I>&gt;<i> this issue when there was some content that I want to buy, was asked where
</I>&gt;<i> I wanted to use it, and as soon as I mentioned SL/opensim, was told it was
</I>&gt;<i> not allowed. Spend a lot of time trying to pry an explanation, all I got is
</I>&gt;<i> some whimsical statement that SL/Opensim do not support 'proprietary
</I>&gt;<i> content' ... I still do not understand what this means in fact.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So now, I have a completely take on content production in virtual
</I>&gt;<i> environments. It is damn expensive to do it. Problem is people cannot pay
</I>&gt;<i> for what it actually costs to produce them. If you earn a salary of say 5
</I>&gt;<i> dollar per hour, just doing a simple texture properly from your own
</I>&gt;<i> pictures etc... can easily take a couple of hours.  Just imagine how much
</I>&gt;<i> other things would cost ... animations and so forth.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think the problem is a much bigger one that meets the eye. You have to
</I>&gt;<i> make every effort to navigate this difficult problem ... it is really easy
</I>&gt;<i> to inadvertently use something you are not supposed to it. All in all,
</I>&gt;<i> looks like you've got to redo everything from scratch ... would be
</I>&gt;<i> interested to see what others think about this.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> okay, this is the second post.  Here is what I am getting at.  Stroker,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> creator of SexGen open sourced and gave full permissions to do whatever
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> with his creations when he left SL.  There was some dispute by his
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> partners, but they made a script that removes all the disputed
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> animations.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Obviously, I can copy text for the scripts, but I would like to move the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> animations to my personal grid.  I can see no way to do this.  I don't
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> see
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> any moral or legal issues as he was very clear as to his intent to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> completely open source it and I have removed the disputed animations -
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> but
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> without the original files, it is no longer possible to export animations
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> even that have full perms that I know of if you are not the creator.  I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> didn't want to say this because of the whole judgement/sex angle, but
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> what
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the heck.  Is there any solution to get those animations out of SL.  I am
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> sure I am not the only one interested in this - I don't plan to profit
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (though I could by the terms of his release), just want to use them in a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> grid outside of SL.  And there are other objects that fall into this same
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> category - person leaves SL, opens it, but without the original files,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> you
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> can't move them out of SL anymore.  Thoughts?  Thanks,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Drew
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There's a couple important concepts about animations and licenses...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> First...Full Perm on Second Life  does NOT mean you are &quot;allowed&quot; to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> export them to any other grid.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Many SL animators specifically PROHIBIT use of their creations on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OpenSim based grids.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     A lot of the sculpty makers do the same thing...   you are welcome to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> buy full perm on SL grid, but you MAY NOT export the shapes.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Since you brought up Stroker as an example...you are also aware that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what someone says/thinks a license says
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     SOMETIMES isn't what the creator specified...  Rather than putting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> yourself and the grid operator in the position
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     of answering DCMA demands, you might limit your Grid imports to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> objects with clear titles.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Second...  The process of uploading the BVH animation file modifies the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> result into a form designed to send to viewers..
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Animations differ from almost every other form of in-world object, in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that you cant re-create it from the packets required to display it in a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> viewer,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     I'm pretty sure the effort it would take to reverse engineer the BVH
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> file from the animation info &quot;users&quot; have access to...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     and probability of legal consequences have been deterrents to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> development of such a utility.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That said... there are animators who are willing to provide the BVH
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> format files for upload to whatever grid will accept them,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but you will find that they expect you to pay them FULL price..   For
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> example...  a marketplace search led to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://inf-designs.com/..">http://inf-designs.com/..</A> selling sets of 12-15 couple animations for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about 60 USD.  ( disclaimer.. this was just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> an exercise in finding &quot;market prices&quot;.. I am NOT recommending them as a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> source of animations... )
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> While the new advances in Motion Capture via Kinect promise to reduce the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cost of generating &quot;custom&quot; animations,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the current costs of  motion capture studio time (thousand of dollars for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> recording/editing/formatting a 30 second animation)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> make it unlikely that creators will be sympathetic to requests to allow
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> uploading to grids that cannot provide any real form of copy protection.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
