<PRE>I'm not sure I can help much since I haven't used Hypergrid for a long time.  However, I presume your setup is that both 
of these servers are on the same LAN behind a firewall and you're connecting in with a viewer from a remote network 
(e.g. over the Internet)?

Also a word of caution, I would still say Hypergrid is experimental (Diva, feel free to disagree with me).  I would be 
very very cautious about using it in a 'business' context without understanding the full implications of having 
Hypergrid active in terms of configuration complexity, management and security issues.  Unfortunately, I don't think 
that kind of thing is really outlined anywhere since the protocol/architecture is still evolving.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have two servers running Diva's r18611.  One for business, one for fun.  I
</I>&gt;<i> can get from the fun server to the business server and back again, but I
</I>&gt;<i> can't get from the business server to the fun server, which is actually
</I>&gt;<i> pretty critical to the plan for the business site.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can hypergrid out (tested with Craft-World) from the business server, but
</I>&gt;<i> it can't locate my fun server when I search.  I double checked, they both
</I>&gt;<i> list the (all lowercase) www address in myworld.ini and RegionConfig.ini,
</I>&gt;<i> and both servers have the same configuration.  Both port ranges are
</I>&gt;<i> forwarded in TCP and UDP through my firewall to their respective computers,
</I>&gt;<i> and are both accessible from outside of my firewall.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Like I said earlier, when I search from the fun server, I find the business
</I>&gt;<i> server no problem. Port there, back, life is good.  It's just the other way
</I>&gt;<i> around that has me stumped.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any thoughts?  I feel like I'm missing something pretty basic, and honestly
</I>&gt;<i> feel dumb for asking.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On a lighter note, I LOVE DIVA.. I spent weeks setting up a functional
</I>&gt;<i> gridded opensim server with Robust from scratch by hand, and oh wow, was
</I>&gt;<i> Diva the way to go.  I can totally do without Robust with the machines that
</I>&gt;<i> I have running this.  Once I get this teleporting between servers thing
</I>&gt;<i> figured out, I will be the happiest kid on the playground. (figuratively, of
</I>&gt;<i> course)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Becky
