<PRE>Second Inventory is designed to do this, but it'll only work if you are the
creator of the content. In this case that means Second Inventory needs to
log into the creator account. If you don't have access to that, you're kind
of screwed. Whether or not SI still works is another story. I haven't used
it in several years. I remember they had a ludicrous phone-home license.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> okay, this is the second post.  Here is what I am getting at.  Stroker,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the creator of SexGen open sourced and gave full permissions to do whatever
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with his creations when he left SL.  There was some dispute by his
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> partners, but they made a script that removes all the disputed animations.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Obviously, I can copy text for the scripts, but I would like to move the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> animations to my personal grid.  I can see no way to do this.  I don't see
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> any moral or legal issues as he was very clear as to his intent to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> completely open source it and I have removed the disputed animations - but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> without the original files, it is no longer possible to export animations
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> even that have full perms that I know of if you are not the creator.  I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> didn't want to say this because of the whole judgement/sex angle, but what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the heck.  Is there any solution to get those animations out of SL.  I am
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sure I am not the only one interested in this - I don't plan to profit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (though I could by the terms of his release), just want to use them in a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> grid outside of SL.  And there are other objects that fall into this same
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> category - person leaves SL, opens it, but without the original files, you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can't move them out of SL anymore.  Thoughts?  Thanks,
