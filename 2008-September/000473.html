<PRE>Hello all,

 

I am having some database problems, I have posted the following on one of
the MySQL support forums this morning.........

 

QUOTE

 

I am using MySQL 5.0.51b community edition on an Windows XP machine (all the
latest updates installed). MySQL was installed using the default options. I
use MySQL to satisfy the database requirements of Opensimulator
(www.opensimulator.org). Currently 25 tables of varying numbers of columns
holding a varity of data types.

 

Recently I decided to upgrade to a bigger machine running Vista Business and
the latest download of MySQL. I took a backup intending to copy this over
and then restore it on the new machine, almost immediately the restore
failed because of an error in one of the tables called &quot;assets&quot; only the
second of the tables, I tried again ignoring the errors this time and after
over an hour it finished but there were only two tables and the &quot;assets&quot;
table only had 23 entries. I tried several more times with the same results,
I have also tried MySQLDump, this failed the restore and told me it had a
problem with line 24 of &quot;assets&quot;. I have now also tried several of my
regular backups and they have all failed to restore.

 

Using MySQLAdministrator to inspect the database I am told that &quot;assets&quot; has
over 17,000 rows and using the maintenance options everything checks out as
OK. If I look at the &quot;assets&quot; table in MySqlBrowser a SELECT * takes 30
seconds to display what it claims is everything and only show just over
8,000 rows. There is a similar inconsistency in row numbers in other tables
as well.

 

I am a complete novice when it comes to database programs but have many
years experience with PC's and Windows as well as a variety of other
systems.

 

Can anybody explain why there are inconsistencies in the line numbers and
suggest what might be going wrong, I guess it is the backup that is failing
rather than the restore and that the problem is caused by some database
corruption but I haven't a clue where to look.

 

Any assistance would be gratefully received, if any more information is
required please let me know and if possible how to obtain it, in simple
language. 

 

END QUOTE

 

I don't think the problem is opensim related other than the fact I'm using
the database for opensim but if anybody has experienced anything similar I
would be interested to hear, if it helps the row in the assets table it
fails on is the texture &quot;gravel&quot;. I download the latest opensim version
several times a week so am reasonably up to date, I have no error messages
on the servers I am aware of. In fact everything seems to be working
reasonably OK, I can apply the texture and use it normally, but if I can
provide any more information please let me know.

 

Thanks

 

Dave
