<PRE>You know, we have options here;
 
how would the perfect developer environment for opensim with a connected viewer look like?
 
I definitively could see a tighter coupling to something like a file system or a revisioning-like system, so that I could just save a file, and that would trigger an recompilation and reload of that file as a script.
that would go excellent with being able to diff and subversion code files; not to mention the ability to use other environments that the built-in editor to work with large codebases (hell, why wouldn't dll's just get sucked up and connected as well, if there's an IScript in them?)
 
Or, should there just be an aux client editor that could post ascript like the client does?
 
Just trying to get ye olde oute-of-the-boxe thinking going.Best regards,Stefan AnderssonTribal Media AB Join the 3d web revolution : <A HREF="http://tribalnet.se/">http://tribalnet.se/</A>

having just wasted most of a day on trying to figure out why OSSL functions such as osSetDynamicTextureData and friends were returning an LSL compile error (ERROR: name not in scope) i thought i'd report back on my findings:

OSSL functions (inspite of the heavy changes in the scripting subsystem in recent days) are working just fine (provided you enabled them as documented in OpenSim.ini.example)
recent LindenLab(tm)/(r) provided secondlife clients (certainly the 1.21 series) are apparently no longer relying on the grid to vet the script and the functions it calls, but instead seem to check all function calls against

list of known LSL function
list of functions you have defined in your script

anything not found on those lists is flagged as &quot;not in scope&quot;once i switched to hippo viewer (<A HREF="http://forge.opensimulator.org/gf/project/opensim-viewer/">http://forge.opensimulator.org/gf/project/opensim-viewer/</A>) everything was fine.    cheers,    dr scofield--
