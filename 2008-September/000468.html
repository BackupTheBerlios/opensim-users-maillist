<PRE>At the inagural Wiki Office Hours this week on Wright Plaza we discussed
 first steps at cleaning up and sorting out our wiki.  There are a lot
of pages in the opensim wiki today, many of which aren't really up to snuff.

One of the ways to start to get a handle on this problem is to get
volunteers to go through and tag pages with some of the following tags:

<A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/WikiStructure#Tags">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/WikiStructure#Tags</A>

In order to tag a page you just need to add one or more of the following
tags to the top of a page:

{{obsolete}}
{{needsexample}}
{{delete}}
{{content}}

They mean the following

obsolete - this page had good information at one point, but it is too
out of date to really have value now.  We need to capture the
information in another page, or do major work to bring the page up to date

content - this page has a little bit of information, but it's very
incomplete.  It probably can stay in the same place but needs more
helping hands.

needsexample - while the content of the page is good, it's too hard to
understand without examples.  We'd like to get examples into this page
to make it more user friendly.

delete - this page is so out of date that it's got nothing of value left
in it on the wiki.  It should just be deleted as it causes more
confusion that anything else.

All are welcome to participate in this review and tagging of the wiki.
Doing this will help us get a sense of where to focus, and what really
needs work.  I'll create a few more tags (like move) next week, as well
as some better wiki guidelines so we can much more easily getting people
involved in helping us have a world class wiki.

	-Sean
