<PRE>Hm; that's an interesting one - I guess if that viewer is tweaked to use another asset Id as default, I don't know what OpenSim should do about it.
Obviously, the viewer then depends on the grid which you use the viewer on having installed the OpenLibrary 3.0;
 
I guess that we can hard-code our plywood asset into that guid to provide a quickfix, but then again I think this is an issue for the viewer coder/grid providers.
 
It's definitively a slippery slope. Although we want to support many clients, we can't embark on supporting every tweak and every grid-specific.
 
Then again, I would say the really progressive, cool and opensim way would be if there was a way for the region to inform the client as of what it considers the default texture to be, without breaking standard sl viewer compatibility. That could also serve as a first step towards client configurability.
 
Could you talk to the viewer programmer and suggest this? See what he/she says?

Hi Stefan,
 
Thanks for the reply, luckley I can now give you a bit more information. I found a blog site for Kirstenlee Cinquetti, late yesterday and sent a message asking for the reason for the change and to check the viewer was behaving as expected. It appears that the viewer is doing what it should and Kirstenlee was kind enough to provide this explination......
 

yus the new testure in r15-1 is the default texture from OpenLibrary 3.0 , r15 of course works almost aswell if you really badly need plywood ^^

I hope this is of assistance and gives you an indication of what is needed.
 
Is this likely to be a change to the asset set, that will be included in a future build? If it is I will wait until then, rather than hack around in the database. Please let me know, it&#8217;s a local grid so I can edit anything I need to.
 
Kirstenlee&#8217;s blog can be found here <A HREF="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=482639195824802744&amp;postID=2160958409374159151&amp;page=1.">https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=482639195824802744&amp;postID=2160958409374159151&amp;page=1.</A>

Dave, Do you have any idea as of why they have done this? If it's for a legitimate reason, I guess one way to solve it is to add another asset to the standard OpenSim asset set with guid cfcb6139-8813-46ff-9975-0afee9b33f70 pointing to the same binary file (the plywood texture) on disk - or you or your grid host could just add another asset to the asset database.I'd be happy to add this to the standard lib if we think it's a good idea.Best regards,Stefan AnderssonTribal Media AB Join the 3d web revolution : <A HREF="http://tribalnet.se/">http://tribalnet.se/</A>

Hi folks,
 
Just installed the latest KirstenLee viewer and all my &#8220;Plywood&#8221; buildings have changed from a pale wood texture to a rather bright green and white pattern.
 
I know that &#8220;Plywood&#8221; is the default texture and am wondering if these lines from the version R15-1 release notes might have a bearing on the problem.......
 
Changed Default Prim Texture to cfcb6139-8813-46ff-9975-0afee9b33f70 Settings &amp; indra.i.
Recompiled with new prim UUID on material codes.
 
I&#8217;d love to get my &#8220;Plywood&#8221; back if possible, I still have R15 and can still see the wood texture fine using that. Any thoughts would be gratefully accepted as would any information on how to contact the creator of the viewer, I can find no email address, web address, method of reporting bugs or of giving feedback.
 
Thanks in advance.
 
Dave
