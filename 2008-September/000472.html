<PRE>I guess we all agree. This started with me hypothesizing that the 
client-side API checks had something to do with security -- an 
hypothesis that is all but solid! Stefan offered another explanation 
having to do with minimizing round trips by catching errors at the 
client. Who knows why they did it... (does anybody know for sure why 
they did this? people in the architecture working group?)

But it does introduce a strong contract between the client and the 
server wrt the code that is allowed to run, and such contract is a bit 
puzzling at this time. In other words, I wish it had something to do 
with security! :-)

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> no. we need to have clear protocol specs and our grids need to be coded in such

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> trust comes in at much higher level (for example, do i trust that grid to adhere
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to the licenses i attach to my objects?). trust should never replace caution and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> self-defense.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Trust is the inseparable heart of any permissions based system.  One 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> needs ways to establish trust to set appropriate permissions at what 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ever level they come up.   One might have their system codified to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> control all actions, but that's often not the case or necessarily the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> goal.  If I want someone to participate I may have to allow them 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> potentially negative actions to participate.  Sometime you can't code 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> around that.  Without some tools for building trust I will likely need 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to caution and defend others from participation.  Trust can be a more 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> powerful tool then caution and defense.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i> i'm not arguing against trust. the discussion started with the
</I>&gt;<i> observation that 1.21 series clients do client side vetting of scripts
</I>&gt;<i> --- and then we got into discussing whether an explicit trust
</I>&gt;<i> relationship would somehow help.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> my points are:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     * to build a robust internet connected system we cannot assume
</I>&gt;<i>       benign clients (even if they present a certificate), we have to
</I>&gt;<i>       build our servers such that they are able to defend themselves;
</I>&gt;<i>       for example, assuming (and relying on  that assumption) that the
</I>&gt;<i>       client is only going to present vetted code to me as a server, is
</I>&gt;<i>       very bad design
</I>&gt;<i>     * trust relationships come in at a different level; for example, at
</I>&gt;<i>       the permission level.
