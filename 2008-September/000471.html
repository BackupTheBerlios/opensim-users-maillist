</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>i'm not arguing against trust. the discussion started with the
observation that 1.21 series clients do client side vetting of scripts
--- and then we got into discussing whether an explicit trust
relationship would somehow help.

my points are:

    * to build a robust internet connected system we cannot assume
      benign clients (even if they present a certificate), we have to
      build our servers such that they are able to defend themselves;
      for example, assuming (and relying on  that assumption) that the
      client is only going to present vetted code to me as a server, is
      very bad design
    * trust relationships come in at a different level; for example, at
      the permission level.
