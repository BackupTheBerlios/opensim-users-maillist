i think this is just bad design: checking at the client and trusting the client
to send &quot;good&quot; code to the server is just naive. the server (if it wants to
survive) has to be its own guardian. after all, we don't stop fixing apache bugs
and assume, &quot;oh, the client will prevent exploits from coming our way&quot;...

no. we need to have clear protocol specs and our grids need to be coded in such
a way that they guard themselves.

trust comes in at much higher level (for example, do i trust that grid to adhere
to the licenses i attach to my objects?). trust should never replace caution and
self-defense.
