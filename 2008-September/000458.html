<PRE>
Today I have re-built my mono 1.91 from scartch outputing the whole process into text files, in hope of finding out what caused my OpenSim crash from my first compile with my first mono 1.91 build (method used from <A HREF="http://xyzzyxyzzy.net/2008/05/08/updated-mono-build-script-for-hardy-heron-and-mono-191/">http://xyzzyxyzzy.net/2008/05/08/updated-mono-build-script-for-hardy-heron-and-mono-191/</A>).

My mono rebuild produced about 52,000 output lines in almost 90 min. Once done, I recompiled my OpenSim and started it. So far I have not crashed again like last time. So I assume it was an isolated incident but would appreciate if someone can look at the supplied outputs.

However, the commands I used in OpenSim created 2 weird problems (can someone look at the supplied outputs?):
1) on the default created region, I did a &quot;terrain elevate 20&quot; + &quot;terrain elevate 30&quot;. I obtained the expected result I was assuming. Then I created a new region next to it with &quot;create-region ...&quot;. It did create a default terrain next to it but the original terrain I had elevated had reverted back to its original height before I elevated it. 

2) After seeing my original terrain that reverted back, I tried to elevate it again with &quot;terrain elevate 50&quot;. It executed the command but added an error message about the command being invalid. When I switched back to my SecondLife, I was seeing the terrain being elevated but for some unknown reasons, my avatar was being pushed vertically and I had no control over its direction. It kept going up. I tried Stop Flying but nothing happened. I had to resort stopping the program fromthe task bar as it seamed frozen. Strangely, my OpenSIm had also stopped (shouldn't it continue running even if we stop SL?)

3) In the execution of my OpenSim, before I started playing with the terrain, I had an &quot; Failed with exception System.NullReferenceException&quot; on the &quot; OpenSim.Region.Environment.Scenes.InnerScene+&lt;&gt;c__CompilerGenerated10.c__58 &quot;

If someone wants to look into this, I can send him/her my outputs.

available outputs (Ubuntu 8.04):
-rebuilding of my mono 1.91 (whole output or message output)
-compiling my OpenSim r6137 with my new rebuilt mono 1.91
-log of my SecondLife
-lof of my opensim.exe
