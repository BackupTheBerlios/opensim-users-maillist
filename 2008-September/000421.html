<PRE>I had opensim running on a machine running windowsXPjust well enough that I really wanted to jump in and start playing with it to learn more...but thought I'd start over by installing a 64 bit OS to take advantage of this machine.  Being most familiar with redhat/fedora, I went for the latest and greatest fedora core 9 and everthing blew up.  Nant would not even build opensim even after I thought I had fulfilled all dependencies by installing the missing libraries with yum.  I even found that nant was even unable to build the simplest programs and removed mono and yum from the source.  NOW, I can build the most rudimentary progs without error (I am totally new to Mono/.net) ...I can even build opensim.exe without error (a huge accomplishment, I think) but when I try to execute it (mono Opensim.exe), it errors complaining about libgdiplus missing. Removing the fedora binaries are easy enough but I'm unable to build libgdiplus from source...the error being
 that libpng12 is now not found.

At this point, I'm really just curious if there are any x64 Linux distro's that will permit me to build opensim without so much of an issue.  Can somebody make a recommendation (or...if you've run into the same probs with fedora9, point me in the right direction) ?

I'd really like to get this going so I can jump in and experience the 'other' problems that others are having with opensim...after it's actually running ;)

Thanks in advance!
