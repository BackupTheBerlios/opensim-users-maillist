Trust is the inseparable heart of any permissions based system.  One 
needs ways to establish trust to set appropriate permissions at what 
ever level they come up.   One might have their system codified to 
control all actions, but that's often not the case or necessarily the 
goal.  If I want someone to participate I may have to allow them 
potentially negative actions to participate.  Sometime you can't code 
around that.  Without some tools for building trust I will likely need 
to caution and defend others from participation.  Trust can be a more 
powerful tool then caution and defense.

John.
