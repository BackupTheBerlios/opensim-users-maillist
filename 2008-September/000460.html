<PRE>Hi,

Maybe you should post this in opensim-dev too.

On Mon, Sep 22, 2008 at 7:04 PM, Browser [ICE] &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-users">browser_ice at hotmail.com</A>&gt; wrote:
&gt;<i> However, the commands I used in OpenSim created 2 weird problems (can someone look at the supplied outputs?):
</I>&gt;<i> 1) on the default created region, I did a &quot;terrain elevate 20&quot; + &quot;terrain elevate 30&quot;. I obtained the expected result I was assuming. Then I created a new region next to it with &quot;create-region ...&quot;. It did create a default terrain next to it but the original terrain I had elevated had reverted back to its original height before I elevated it.
</I>
That's really odd, I have done that action a few times myself. Hmm,
maybe you should try a &quot;bake&quot;?

&gt;<i> 2) After seeing my original terrain that reverted back, I tried to elevate it again with &quot;terrain elevate 50&quot;. It executed the command but added an error message about the command being invalid. When I switched back to my SecondLife, I was seeing the terrain being elevated but for some unknown reasons, my avatar was being pushed vertically and I had no control over its direction. It kept going up. I tried Stop Flying but nothing happened. I had to resort stopping the program fromthe task bar as it seamed frozen. Strangely, my OpenSIm had also stopped (shouldn't it continue running even if we stop SL?)
</I>
Assuming that you're referring to the viewer by SecondLife, that is
still a bit problematic. Unless you're high enough above the terrain,
it can cause your viewer to crash as the ground level suddenly is
above avatar.
With normal (in-world) elevations your avatar would pop up or down
along with the action (as seen in SL). That is normal behaviour. I am
not sure, but my guess is that if you elevate on the server-side and
make the height too different (lots higher) that the avatar position
you see that effect that you experienced.
I don't think that the Simulator stopped for that reason, it shouldn't
at least. Try again, if you can...

&gt;<i> 3) In the execution of my OpenSim, before I started playing with the terrain, I had an &quot; Failed with exception System.NullReferenceException&quot; on the &quot; OpenSim.Region.Environment.Scenes.InnerScene+&lt;&gt;c__CompilerGenerated10.c__58 &quot;
</I>
That's one for the devs, as I have no programming experience.

Good luck
