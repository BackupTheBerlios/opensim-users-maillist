</I>The trust API must exist on both ends, client and server; not just on 
one of them. On the server side there need to be policies wrt what code 
to be run, too. As you say, clear protocol specs; which combination of 
IPs/agents/users/actions do the region servers trust code coming from?

My comment about asking the user pertains to the recent LL's 
*client-side* API checks, which seem a bit odd. I'd much rather receive 
information about what the region server is able to do to me (as a 
client), along with reputation information (certificates and other), and 
decide whether I want to allow it or not. Basically, if you never heard 
about the Xworld, and you can't find any information about it, you 
probably shouldn't even go there. Rather than &quot;well, that region seems 
to comply with LSL, go ahead, you're safe.&quot;
