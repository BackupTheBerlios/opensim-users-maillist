<PRE>Did you check the iptables(if on linux) script? I used it succesfully to have 
both internal and external access to the sims.

kind regards,

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Let me give a recap of all we've checked, just so we're clear:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, we did look at the various websites like the one at the link you gave,
</I>&gt;<i> Diva, when installing the distro, and we followed the instructions, and we
</I>&gt;<i> have since checked and rechecked several times as the only help we seem to
</I>&gt;<i> be getting is links to the ports issue.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> YES, port 9000 is open on the server machine for TCP and UDP
</I>&gt;<i> YES, ports 9001 to 9003 are open for UDP
</I>&gt;<i> We have used a port checker which confirmed this, and
</I>&gt;<i> YES, they are open on the firewall and directed to the server machine.
</I>&gt;<i> We have checked with port checkers both from inside and outside the
</I>&gt;<i> network.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> YES, all address references in the myworld.ini and regions files point to
</I>&gt;<i> the DYNDNS address
</I>&gt;<i> YES, we have changed all the inside-LAN clients' hostfiles to point to the
</I>&gt;<i> DYNDNS address to the server
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We even bought a new router, since we learned the previous one was an older
</I>&gt;<i> model that did not support NAT loopback, after attempting multiple
</I>&gt;<i> (fruitless) firmware updates.  The new router is a Sagem <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-users">F at ST</A> 2504 with
</I>&gt;<i> firmware version 2.8Sky (our broadband provider is Sky), which supposedly
</I>&gt;<i> does support NAT loopback.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As a result:
</I>&gt;<i> EXTERNAL users can now get in, past the handshake and inworld, but
</I>&gt;<i> INTERNAL users fail at handshake.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As we have said, the only way we we seem to get internal users in is by
</I>&gt;<i> adding an entry in the hosts file of the SERVER machine, which then
</I>&gt;<i> prevents people from outside getting in until that entry is removed from
</I>&gt;<i> the hosts file on the server machine.  This is kludgy and not a good
</I>&gt;<i> permanent solution, but it enables us to work together.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I hope this has made our problem more clear and that there is a solution
</I>&gt;<i> other than to keep checking the same information we have already looked at
</I>&gt;<i> and tried.  All your help is very much appreciated, and we've learned an
</I>&gt;<i> enormous amount thus far, but we are still stymied by this last bit.
