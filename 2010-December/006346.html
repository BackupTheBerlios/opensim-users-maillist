<PRE>Hi all,

We found the Flotsam groups module a super example of a basic groups
implementation, but it was not quite what we wanted to use. The main driver
for us was that we wanted a solution that we could use for other projects
and platforms.

The summary of our changes - we have been working with OpenSim 0.6.9 for our
initial release, though we will make any necessary changes for the 0.7+
transition when we move our OpenSim efforts forward. I'm thrilled at all the
work that is going into the current 0.7 edition, and we'll be joining those
of you on 0.7 some time early next year.

We wanted to keep the changes to core modules as minimal as possible, and
follow a similar path to the Flotsam implementation, so our server piece is
a web service that is contacted by region servers. In our case, we are using
WCF, which is also I believe part of Mono <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/WCF">http://www.mono-project.com/WCF</A>
although we have not tested our platform on Linux at this time. We've only
just put the module live on a handful of our main regions, so we're going to
put it through as much testing as we can before we release to our customers
over the next couple of weeks. If any of you want to check it out, we have
groups enabled on our Core1 region now, as well as Code Torque, Jeff Lowe
and Tarzan regions. Source code will be going up very soon, and we'll drop
you guys links soon as that happens.

We're not a big corporation, this is the first time we've ever really done a
press release, but really it's not that different from just mailing this
list and saying &quot;hey guys, here's an alternative&quot; -which is not all that
different from the Simian project as far as I can tell. No-one has to use
our stuff, but we believe it is a good piece of code, a bit more robust and
architecturally extensible than Flotsam so that it can be used for other
purposes other than just OpenSim. 

The majority of our work with OpenSim to date has been working on management
tools for our customers - groups have been the number one missing feature
from our grids for quite some time, and we wanted to do it right. We have
not had a lot of time to give back to the community over the past few years,
but we are strong supporters of the OpenSimulator project, and we felt this
was a good opportunity to give something back. I would like to thank Kurt
Evenopoel for his work on our module - he is a super smart developer who has
done a great job on this. 

Thanks,

Chris

My guess is that the Windows lock-in is for the server technology, but sure
you should be able to use it with MAC or Linux client software.

Maybe Pathfinder could also post us the link to the source code repository,
so we all could see how this compares to other group modules available
already :)

Olli

Pathfinder has the spirit of a pioneer and in his blog and his creation of
the &quot;Adventurers Club&quot; and a lot of other ventures he lets this pioneer
spirit shine through.  He may not have even known about the other group
modules.  I didn't.  In fact, I'm still waiting to get my question answered
whether since his solution is Windows based whether I can use it on a Mac.
But the bottom line is that I believe his contribution was not a business
venture but a sincere note of excitement as a pioneer as we're all
traversing new territory.  To use his analogy of pioneers, if the
chuckwagons are going across the desert, I don't think anyone cares if the
person who brings water has a commercial label on it or if there are other
water sources as well we didn't know about.

The whole Opensim/Reaction grid thing is an attempt at wayfinding for
solutions.  His is one.  Instead of attacking (maybe being too sensitive to
the landlords of the lands we're leaving) let's not over-react to fellow
list members and question their motives unless there is an outright sales
pitch or &quot;check our prices&quot; line involved.

&gt;<i> Fleep,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I believe you are well informed about your topic, Second Life - 
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSimulator and assume you read the related blogs, that you are 
</I>&gt;<i> regularly visiting the related news sites like 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.hypergridbusiness.com/">http://www.hypergridbusiness.com/</A> - where a &quot;Press release&quot; should be 
</I>&gt;<i> send to.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Most of the participants and contributors of this list don't write a 
</I>&gt;<i> press release about every commitment they do.
</I>&gt;<i> If they would, the mailinglist would clearly become just another 
</I>&gt;<i> marketing channel - and therefore useless to deliver support for 
</I>&gt;<i> people who have questions and are in need of support.
