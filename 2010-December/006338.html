In general, I would say that we're trying to avoid having more stuff to maintain in core, especially as third party 
groups services exist already.

Having said that, I haven't heard strong opposition to having groups in core since it is a fairly major piece of 
functionality.  But that also means that it's quite a lot of work to do.
