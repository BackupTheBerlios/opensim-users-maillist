&gt;<i> Nobody is stopping anyone from starting their own opensim- educators list to pontificate in similar ways as currently happens in the equivalent SL list. The current &quot;official&quot; opensim lists (user and dev) are fundamentally no different in character to those of other open- source project lists and are fine as they are. It's great to see a critical mass of support developing for the opensim platform from the Edu sector and maybe now is the time to create a list specifically for educators to cater to your particular cultural norms rather than (however respectfully) impose yours on others when the prevailing one for this list  (essentially technical in nature- the dev list obviously more so than the users list) is perfectly acceptable.
</I>

I always assume a &quot;users&quot; list is just that, a list open for the interest, concerns, questions of all users of the project or whatever all participants are users of.     I don't see any reason to say or imply that stuff that is &quot;edu&quot; user specific doesn't belong here or to claim the list should only be about/for technical questions.  What am I missing?

&gt;<i> Now, back &quot;on topic&quot;, are there any plans or thoughts to make Mumble part of opensim core in a similar way to freeswitch and vivox or will it stay as a third party module such as  the flotsam groups, ossearch and offline messaging modules?
</I>
Your idea of &quot;on topic&quot; anyway.   If this list is not a general opensim users list as the title implies then I believe there should be such a list.
