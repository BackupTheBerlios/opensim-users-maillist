</I>&gt;<i> [14:59] &lt;fleep&gt; Running 0.7.0.2 Release (interface version 6) in Grid mode, HG1.5 - briefly searched mantis but wondering if this is a known bug and if there are any work arounds where edits made to objects in world don't persist after restarting sims?
</I>&gt;<i> [15:00] &lt;fleep&gt; I have a table, for example, rezzed out in the world.  Stretched some of the prims to make it longer but after restart it's back to its original shape.  Known issue?  Any console commands to make the changes persist or force a save?  (backup command seems to do nothing)
</I>&gt;<i> [15:00] &lt;fleep&gt; Thanks in advance.  :)
</I>&gt;<i> [15:02] &lt;fleep&gt; (For reference, I've edited that darn table like 5 times following reboots, so it didn't just happen a single time)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Seems like every time I reboot the sims that silly table goes back to its original shape..

Are you both its creator and owner?  I experienced a problem where the creator made me able to edit any of her things as a friend but where no edits would stick.  They reverted immediately upon leaving edit mode though.
