<PRE>Well said Chris/Fleep.  I totally agree.  This group should either be a
little more open and friendly or at least make it clear that that it's not.
I find many of the topics covered here have little relevance to me and I
just delete them.  It's really not that hard.  But now and then, something
comes across that I need to know and that's the value I find in this group.

Subject: Re: [Opensim-users] Google Earth for the Human Body


I'm not in charge of moderating this list and I will of course honor the
guidance of those who do, but I'd like to respectfully voice an objection.
I think the original post is of great interest to the community of opensim
users.   

I'm sure I'm not the only one who hopes to see the opensim community
continue to grow, and a key component of any community's growth is having
communication channels to share relevant information.  In my view, something
does not have to be only about opensim to be relevant, useful, or of
interest to the opensim userbase.  And yet in the few months I've been
subscribed I've seen several users chastised for sharing relevant
information.  It's very unwelcoming and surprising to a newcomer.


Perhaps it might be helpful for whoever is in charge to write some kind of
introductory description on the opensim-users listserv page specifically
noting the strict posting guidelines.  I have participated in zillions of
listservs in my time and I don't think I've ever seen one as restrictive as
this one about topicality.   I think it's unfortunate and a poor choice if
the goal is community growth, but if that is the way it is then that should
be very clearly communicated on the listserv sign up page so at least people
will understand that this user list is not like other user lists they may
have used where broader information sharing is encouraged.

Communicating the forum boundaries in advance is far better than (sometimes
rudely) chastising people who are trying to share relevant information in
good faith and had no way of knowing that it wasn't welcome.


Sincerely,

- Chris/Fleep

Posts to this list should have something to do with OpenSim.

I don't know of many good lists for discussing virtual world/environment
topics in general.  One such is the VirtualWorlds group on Linkedin

<A HREF="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?mostPopular=">http://www.linkedin.com/groups?mostPopular=</A>
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?mostPopular=&amp;gid=744527">http://www.linkedin.com/groups?mostPopular=&amp;gid=744527</A>&gt; &amp;gid=744527

(which is members only but anybody who applies is added, afaik).

I didn't find it spammy at all. It was very interesting, and relevant
in that the link discussed how avatars might be developing in the
future. Are there explicit restrictions or guidelines for posting to
the list? Puzzled, Patricia

(My apologies if this comes through twice - I accidentally posted from
the wrong email address.

Subject: [Opensim-users] Google Earth for the Human Body

Behold Google's Body Browser in WebGL -- Google Earth for the Human
Body (And the Shape of Avatars to Come)

The Google Body Browser is very
cool application of WebGL, the 3D graphics protocol that was just
integrated into Google Chrome's Beta channel
today.
To check it out, you'll of course need to download Chrome
Beta or Firefox
Beta. It displays a human
body in full 3D, and at the moment (it's only a 20% complete
application), you can move your camera view around it entirely.

Detail and take a look
here.<A HREF="http://nwn.blogs.com/nwn/2010/12/google-body-browser.html">http://nwn.blogs.com/nwn/2010/12/google-body-browser.html</A>
