<PRE>Hi Drew,

If you want to try hosting it yourself, I'm running opensim 0.7.0.2 at
home on a retired desktop machine.  It's a P4 3Ghz box with 2GB RAM, WinXP
32bit and seems to work great for my purposes, which is mostly testing
stuff, playing around with hypergridding, building, and small group meetings
from time to time.  I did get a static IP address from my ISP and registered
a domain name for it, but beyond that a box that was just collecting dust in
the closet seems to be serving well.  You can visit to see the performance
if you like, create an account at <A HREF="http://fleepgrid.com">http://fleepgrid.com</A> and the loginuri is
<A HREF="http://fleepgrid.com:8002.">http://fleepgrid.com:8002.</A>  For registration and account creation, I used
the DivaDistro wifi registration module at
<A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Wifi">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Wifi</A> and it works great out of the box, so to
speak.

I had opensim running in standalone mode on my Win7 64bit machine for a
while and don't recall any problems offhand but I didn't do much with it and
pretty quickly moved to the dedicated machine so someone else might have
better info on 64bit environments.  We've also got opensim running at work
on two virtual machines on Windows Server 2008, so as far as I know Windows
XP, 7, and Server 2008 all work.

As for hosted solution, I've also got a sim on Reaction Grid and have only
super positive things to say about their customer service and the community
of users there, but honestly if you have an old box at home to give it a
try, I highly recommend hosting your own grid if you can.  You'll learn tons
and I'm not a super geek so if I can figure it out, anyone can.  ;)

Best of luck and let us know what you end up choosing!

&gt;<i> Some general questions:
