Thanks Ai! The thumb you linked looks like exactly what I need! I'll
give your suggestion a shot and respond in this thread how it goes.

Also, I discovered an error of my own -- I had been using the
non-existent command 'export map' when it should have been
'export-map' with a hyphen... doh! So when trying it with the correct
command, it does indeed export a jpeg, however it seems to only create
a big blue square, all water and not a sim in sight.

When trying the camera idea I mentioned previous, it would appear that
camera lsl has not yet been implemented in OpenSim?

Cheers,
~!CJ

Hmmm, afraid I'm not able to follow your directions. I made the
changes to the opensim.ini file (especially good to have the
TextureOnMapTile=True), and now the world map shows terrain more
accurately! A step in the right direction, to be sure. That was the
easy part.

The only information to be found online about Warp3D (other than a few
bug reports regarding implementation in connection to OS) refers to
Amiga computers, and I can't figure out how it applies to OpenSim or
how to utilize it?

I don't really understand the bit about the 'request' url. I
understand that I need to substitute the relevant information into the
format provided, but I'm not sure where to find and/or put the
necessary information.

The 'export-map' command still results in a big blue square as well.
Searching online about this, others seem to have this problem but
haven't seen a solution.

Apologies for being so dense, I'm relatively new to the backend so I'm
still at the beginning of the learning curve!

Thanks,
~!CJ
