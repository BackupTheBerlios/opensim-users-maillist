<PRE>I've gotten myself into a bit of a pickle it would seem, been doing
lots and lots of building, uploading, etc. with a user (Cider Jack,
natch) I created on my sim-on-a-stick, because I didn't want to work
as 'usb me' among other things...

So my problem is that I suddenly either need Cider's full inventory
available to usb me, or Cider needs usb me's admin level of
permissions, whatever level that is. Cider has Estate Mgr perms at the
moment, but it's not nearly enough. I could download Cider's inventory
as an IAR then upload it for usb me, but that would require manually
rebuilding the entire folder tree of probably hundreds by now of
folders-within-folders before uploading the IAR.

Anyway, long story short, Cider needs full admin/god powers and I
haven't been able to find anything online about how to grant them? Is
there a wiki page I've overlooked or does someone know the command
(I'm assuming it's a single line console command)?

Can't get any more work done until I solve this problem - going nuts here! :)

Cheers,
~!CJ
