<PRE>The security introduced in HG 1.5 makes the viewer crash if the 
departing grid doesn't run 1.5. The receiving simulator performs some 
checks that only exist in 1.5, and if they fail, the viewer crashes, per 
design.

Between these two, the incompatibility was unintentional, but 
unavoidable. The culprit was actually libomv. There is a bug in the 
libomv that is packaged in 0.7.0.2 and that was fixed some time later. 
The fix makes TPs to older versions (that have the bug) fail. As such, 
this incompatibility was unavoidable; we couldn't keep the bug in that 
library for the sake of backwards compatibility in HG.

I don't like the naming i6/i7, because the HG interface didn't change. 
There were some changes in the way appearance is packaged, but that, by 
itself, would not make things incompatible. libomv's bug was the 
dominant factor, and I could not get around the consequences of that bug 
fix. But if those strings i6/i7 make people happy, I'm not going to 
fight it.
