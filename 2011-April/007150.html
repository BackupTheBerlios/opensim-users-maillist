<PRE>Ah thankyou, good suggestions both.

@BlueWall - Editing the .ini would work for me for now, it's a
standalone I just use as a sandbox / region builder, but I do expect
to be connecting (at least on occasion) to the hypergrid, so I'll have
to mark it in a way to remind me to set it back to the default when I
do that... I must take the time to look a little deeper into the .ini
file and see what other settings I can play with -- this may be the
beginning of the end! ;)

@Fleep - PHPmyAdmin had crossed my mind (as I am using MySQL), but I
wasn't sure how to get started - I'm sure it's probably pretty well
documented though so I shouldn't have much (if any) problem going with
that. And as you say, I'm sure this isn't the last time I'll want
direct access to the database!

Problem solved! :)
