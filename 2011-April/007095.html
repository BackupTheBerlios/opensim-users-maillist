<PRE>I really need the automated updating functionality in the DIVA releases, so I
downloaded and installed diva-r13981.zip from 
<A HREF="https://github.com/diva/d2/downloads">https://github.com/diva/d2/downloads</A> <A HREF="https://github.com/diva/d2/downloads">https://github.com/diva/d2/downloads</A> 

I've gotten the core installation running properly (I think) and it does say
it is loading the web server on port 9000, but when I try to connect to it,
I get the following every single time:

Ooops!
The page you requested has been obsconded with by knomes. Find hippos quick!
If you are trying to log-in, your link parameters should have: &quot;-loginpage
<A HREF="http:///?method=login">http:///?method=login</A> -loginuri <A HREF="http:///">http:///</A>&quot; in your link

I have absolutely zero idea how to resolve this. No matter what I try I
can't connect to the web interface.

Additionally, is the DIVA release supposed to have a wifi.ini file? Some
pages I have been reading mention a Wifi.ini file. Mine does not have one.
Nor does it have a &quot;create user&quot; command from the console, so I have no idea
how I even go about creating a user. 

Also, it doesn't prompt me with any create user questions on first run, as
older OpenSim versions did, like so: 
<A HREF="https://github.com/diva/d2/wiki/OpenSim-Questions">https://github.com/diva/d2/wiki/OpenSim-Questions</A>
<A HREF="https://github.com/diva/d2/wiki/OpenSim-Questions">https://github.com/diva/d2/wiki/OpenSim-Questions</A> 
It just loads up the 2x2 grid of sims, tells me it has loaded the webserver
on port 9000, goes to the root# prompt, and that's it...

So at this moment, I have what appears to be a brand new MySQL and OpenSIM
diva-r13981 installation, but with no way to access the web interface and
therefore no way to create users to start using the system.. Can someone
please help me? I'm losing my mind trying to get this figured out, have read
several dozen pages of conflicting and/or irrelevant information and
information which apparently doesn't match my downloaded copy, so I'm really
lost... Please help...

I have older copies of OS sitting on the same machine and have no problem
running them, but these new releases don't have any &quot;create user&quot; command
and only a web interface which I can't seem to figure out how to access.

M.
