<PRE>Thanks for the reply Justin. 

So to protect it with a Firewall, would that be putting port 8003 behind
the firewall?  Is that the port used between region and grid servers and
8002 the port used by the client to connect to regions/grid?

Regards
Tim

The keys were removed some time ago.  As far as I recall, the feeling
was that it didn't provide meaningful security and there were no strong
objections to their removal.

If you want to protect your robust server then you will need to do it
via firewall settings.
