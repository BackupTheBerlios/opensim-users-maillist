</I>&gt;<i> Just a note that phpMyAdmin is widely known for security problems (in other words hackers tend to learn how to break into your computer via each new version).  I wouldn't run it on any computer with data on that I cared about.  On the other hand if you're just running OpenSim as a hobby and your accounts don't have valuable passwords on, there's no real reason not to try it.

I would run phpmyadmin only behind a firewalled access. so only 1 or a
few can access it. then phpmyadmin is good useable.


For the command-line cowboys and cowgirls:

1) Login to MySQL command-line client (installs with MYSQL Server under windows and can be launched from the MySQL Folder under your Programs toolbar). The password is whatever the root password you used when you installed MySQL.

2) type the following at the command prompt:

use opensim;      # This changes the database to the opensim database which is what you want to alter. I assume here that you have called your database &quot;opensim&quot;.

UPDATE useraccounts SET UserLevel=200 where FirstName=&quot;&quot;;  # Place the avatars's first name between &quot;&quot;. You can also use LastName or any other column in that table. I've                       									     # just found that FirstName or LastName is the most obvious and easiest to use. 

BTW, case isn't important for the SQL parts- in this case UPDATE and SET. Lowercase is OK. Case is important for the column names though (in this case UserLevel and FirstName).
