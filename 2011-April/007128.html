<PRE>YAY!!! I was really grabbing at straws, so I reinstalled .NET 3.5 SP1 early
this morning and it worked! Then I checked back here and see the other
suggestions for that also, so that was definitely the issue. I don't know
what happened but something must have been screwy with my .NET 3.5
installation... I reinstalled it and restarted the machine, loaded opensim
and voila! Regions started loading :) So after doing a happy dance I let
myself get some sleep, and now I'm reloading XP from a clean partition image
and will reinstall .NET 3.5 SP1 and then mySQL and OS-diva and hopefully
it'll go smoothly this time.. Hopefully I don't jinx myself by redoing it!
:<i>) In any case, thank you everyone for the assistance. It's very much
</I>appreciated!

M.
