<PRE>Hi

 

I have done some searching but haven't been able to find anything on
this, I am sorry if I have missed something obvious.

 

Back in 0.6 the grid servers required a send and receive key to
authorise the region server to register with the grid server.   I can't
see any obvious facility for this now in Robust.   I run a small
personal grid and recently moved it to another server with Robust and
OpenSim.ini (with about 8 regions) running on that machine.   I kept
some regions that were not often used on my existing server and changed
them to connect to the Robust server on the new machine.   It all worked
perfectly so that was good.. but it got me thinking.   When I set my old
server to register regions on the external robust server, all I had to
do was point it to the address.  I didn't have to put in any key to sell
the Robust server who I was.   Apart from the security via obscurity of
people not guessing the address of my Robust server, anyone could
register any regions on this it seems.

 

There must be more to it than this, what am I missing?

 

Regards

Tim Gildersleeve
