<PRE>Aloha..

Just a word of caution regarding the script delay multiplier.

While the vast majority of simple scripts CAN benefit greatly by adjusting
this value down, Administrators and scriptwriters need to be aware that this
can also introduce errors that are very difficult to debug.   While it may
seem advantageous to complete the loop through your link message generation
as fast as possible,   you cant ignore the fact that there is a hard coded
limit on the number of events that will queue...   Generate them at the
&quot;correct&quot; speed  and they will be processed,  Flood the event queue and some
may be &quot;dropped&quot;  without regard to the order they were generated and
without notification.    While it may be  hyper-frustrating to wait those
extra milliseconds (JOKE)..  It is easier than debugging  why on one run
the 8th event never fired  and on the next   the 12th, 18th, and 42nd   did
not ...

The O.P.  also indicted that part of the project involved the use of the
osDynamicTexture functions.  It has been my experience that delays related
to in-world displays of generated textures (depending on the size of the
generated texture) are  MORE dependent on the availability of bandwidth to
move them to viewers than script processing speeds.   In this case,
repeatedly shoving textures into the pipe for display may also be
&quot;counter-productive&quot;.

In limited cases, for specific scripts, it might work to set the delay to
0.0,  but it has been my experience that SOME delay factor is the &quot;proper&quot;
setting...  YMMV, and experimentation is the only way to tell...
