<PRE>Teravus,
    Thank you for that explanation.  I guess nothing is simple.  The more I 
tested the less clear it was exactly how things worked.

We've had this discussion before on this list so you might be able to
dig in the archives for the long winded answer.

The short winded answer is this:   The UDP protocol requires that the
login server and any 'region connect' messages have an IP address in
the response to the client.  If the UDP protocol allowed you to only
send a hostname, then this wouldn't be an issue.   As far as the
region looking up it's DNS info, neither the login server, or the
region has enough of a network structure understanding to manage that
'external ip/internal ip' thing better at the moment.    Ideally,
someone could write a subnet matching/ip rewriting scheme that gets
sent to the login server so that the login server could supply the
correct IP address based on the connecting client ip but it's probably
going to be a lot of work to refactor that in because of the
complexities of the object RegionInfo and how it interacts with the
various types of grid services, (standalone, grid, standalone grid,
hypergrid...  etc).

One thing that I think is important to note.    I vaguely remember
something about sending the client 0.0.0.0 and triggering the client
to do the lookup but, at the time, the client had some bugs that
prevented it from working.   That might be a more feasable way to move
forward.   Test that option.

-Teravus
