<PRE>I'm actually not using an external address because the intention was to use
this as a private sandbox for now, and for the foreseeable future there's no
need to have external access, so I've been trying to get this working
internally on the LAN... 

I've tried, from the OS machine, <A HREF="http://127.0.0.1:9000/wifi/">http://127.0.0.1:9000/wifi/</A> and
<A HREF="http://localhost:9000/wifi/">http://localhost:9000/wifi/</A> and <A HREF="http://192.168.#.#:9000/wifi/">http://192.168.#.#:9000/wifi/</A> (the #'s being
the actual NAT numbers on my LAN, of course), and from another machine on my
network I've tried <A HREF="http://192.168.#.#:9000/wifi/">http://192.168.#.#:9000/wifi/</A> using the LAN address of
the OS machine, and no matter what I try I get the same knomes response each
and every time. I've tried disabling NAT redirect on the router.. I've tried
disabling my firewall entirely.. I feel like I've exhausted every possible
variant of the address from every possible machine under every possible
combination of router/no router... firewall/no firewall... OS machine/other
machine... etc etc.

I used these instructions to the letter to do the actual mySQL and DIVA
installation:

I've been testing this on Firefox 4.0, so I don't know if maybe that's the
problem, as opposed to Firefox 3.6 or earlier, but at this point I just want
to scream because this is getting ridiculous. A full 24 hours lost now
trying to get this release working. I have half a mind to do a complete
fresh reinstall of XP and start over, but I have a feeling it's just going
to be the same issue. Nothing shows up in the console log when I try to
access that page, but it must be hitting something in the installation
folder in order to show that error, so I really have no idea what's going
on. :(

Another thing that concerns me is that the page I referenced in my first
post shows that on first-run, the console prompts you to create a region and
user, etc, as I recall doing in older versions of OS, but I get no such
prompt with the DIVA release...
