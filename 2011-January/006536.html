<PRE>I seem to have problems with some attachments and textures when 
logging into OSGrid (at least that where I have noticed the issue)... 
and I realise that the assets such as clothing items or objects 
created and then taken into inventory, and textures uploaded, were 
perhaps all initially created while on a region in OSGrid that would 
be separately maintained and DB hosted by a third party - either my 
own regions or on a sandbox hosted by a third party.  In some cases 
the items were uploaded from Second Inventory, which uses a mechanism 
of building on the region you are on - where you have to have build 
permissions - and then taking objects into inventory.

The items are of course in the avatar inventory, which is grid level 
maintained on grids like OSGrid.

I wonder what happens when the region on which such items originally 
might have been created disappears (perhaps forever), or is not 
running? Is that irrelevant, and anything in avatar inventory is 
ALWAYS available even when regions are not present?
