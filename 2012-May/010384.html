<PRE>I was working on building content for my grid when I got a warning from 
windows during using an external application.  I typed &quot;Show stats&quot; in 
the console to find this.

Now I have a lot more I want to add to my grid.  I currently run all 
that you see in my tag lines.

Opensim User: Standalone Grid on Version 0.7.3.1 with 56 Regions
on Windows 7, 64-bit. Phenom 9500 2.2 ghz Quad Core, Terabyte Hard
Drive, 8gig DDR2 RAM.  Used XAMPP to load PHP Version 5.3.0, Apache
and MySQL 5.1.41-community edition.  Groups, Profiles, Voice and
Offline Mesages all working. (Not yet Public, 6 users allowed Now).

I only have one sim with much on it, I was planning on making the other 
sims well forested and a couple more villages and then Shuri Castle from 
Okinawa in the middle.  The reason for 56 regions was to make a nice 1.5 
mile landscape all the way around the castle and surrounding villages.

Am I expecting to much of my system and Opensim to be able to do this on 
one computer.  I plan to eventually upgrade to a 32 gig DDR3, am3+ 
bulldozer motherboard.  Looking at what little it took to fill over 6 
gig of ram, I am worried after I save up a while and get the upgrade 
that it won't be enough to do all the things I dream of.

Am I over reaching?  I thought opensim even in 64bit used some disk 
cashing, and wouldn't use all the available ram?  I still want to be 
able to do other things with my machine while running my grid.  Seems I 
can't always do that without a shutdown a program warning from windows 7.

Info is welcome.
