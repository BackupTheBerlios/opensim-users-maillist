<PRE>&gt;<i> Can I use Sloodle to control/manage inventory? I want to build roads with
</I>&gt;<i> variety shapes remotely.( For example 'S' shape or 'O' shape road... it may
</I>&gt;<i> be any shape which I need to build dynamically) To do that, I keep some
</I>&gt;<i> samples of road objects in inventory and as soon as command comes from
</I>&gt;<i> remote, the object in the inventory should be pasted to the world.
</I>
It wasn't really designed for this, but I guess it would get you some
of the way. I mentioned sloodle because I thought you might want to
learn from the scripts or plunder them for code, but you could do it,
as long as you don't mind running a Moodle server running somewhere to
control it all.

What sloodle 2.0 can do for you is rez collections of objects and
store their positions relative to a rezzer object in what we call a
&quot;scene&quot;. Here's a video Fire Centaur made of it so you can see what I
mean:
<A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDOOXNR_5bM">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDOOXNR_5bM</A>

In your case you might have prims for sections of road of different
shapes, and create scenes consisting of sections of road placed in
order. If I'm reading you right it sounds like in your case rather
than rezzing everything, arranging it and saving the positions, you'd
want to make the arrangements automatically, according some kind of
external logic?

We do actually have some code that creates scenes automatically on the
server side - in this case the idea is that somebody has an arbitrary
bunch of activities attached to their Moodle course, and we want to
rez them in-world arranged in a sensible way.

In our case this gets called via the browser, which hits this script:
<A HREF="https://github.com/sloodle/moodle-mod_sloodle/blob/master/mod/set-1.0/shared_media/generate_layout_entries.php">https://github.com/sloodle/moodle-mod_sloodle/blob/master/mod/set-1.0/shared_media/generate_layout_entries.php</A>
I guess you'd have to replace that with your own logic that decides
where the various objects should go when they get rezzed in-world.
