<PRE>So we're getting ready to roll out SLOODLE and Avatar Classroom to the
free-flying masses, and I'm wondering what to do to make our objects
easily available to people on a lot of different grids. We'll be
updating fairly often, so I'd like the process to be of releasing this
thing to people to be as smooth as possible (and hopefully automated)
for us, and simple for people who use our objects.

I'll be providing an IAR, which people with their own grids can load
in, but presumably a lot of people out there on third-party grids will
lack the necessary permissions and/or know-how to do that. Is there a
viable solution using hypergrid where I can make an object available
on one grid and people can easily pick it up and take it back to their
own grid? Or are there problems with hypergrid-based inventory (not
enough grids support it, or technical issues) that make that
unreliable?

Any other suggestions?
