<PRE>Chris,

I thoroughly agree.  I have been running 16 OS processes (256 regions) on the same box for a few years now and have never seen these problems.  Last semester we taught a class AND ran two tests:  first we set up the GMU Fairfax campus on first a 4 OS process install (4OSx16regions) and then completed the class on a 1 OS process install with 64 regions.  Both worked quite well although the 1X64 with +18K prims was a &quot;little&quot; laggy but still tolerable.

My personal preference from a &quot;headaches&quot; perspective remains a distributed approach.  The use of dual Intel multi-core/hyperthreaded CPUs and a strong, well-threaded operating system is hard to beat.  Best of all, if I understand correctly, &quot;may be&quot; the cloud architecture that our friends out on the west coast are using .....  I'd really like to know more about how to set one of &quot;those&quot; up.

  We ran into memory issues when we had 32 regions on a single simulator and shortly thereafter switched to ~ 4 regions per opensim process architecture.  The overall memory allocation went up, but the performance improved considerably.  Have you tried portioning things out across multiple opensim processes?

    Not that is will make a difference, but I run 56 not 64.  I rebooted my system and checked stats.  The memory used started at 1205 and over night without any use that I know of, it rose up to 5349 MB.  I would be saving cost of installation, with my knowledge and my wife's good sight, I can do the install myself.  Getting all the parts for the upgrade to a AM3+ 8 core bulldozer on a FX990 MSI mobo and 32 gig of crucial DDR3, for under $600 would be worth it for opensim or not?

    It will take me sacrifice and lots of effort.  I didn't want to go through all that and find out even that won't run my 56 regions well.  I thought I might have set something wrong.  I double checked last night to be sure I used MySQL for cashing regions and not the default memory setting.  I did it right, so it wasn't that.  Anyone know of any memory leaks in the ODE or something else to do with version 7.3.1?

      I'm very surprised at the big difference between actual heap allocation (883 mb) and actual process allocation (6193mb).  You might want to monitor memory usage over time - it might be that some kind of peak in heap has put the process memory up to a permanently higher level.

      Unfortunately, memory usage on OpenSimulator will go up and down quite a bit as many objects are allocated before the GC kicks in.

      That said, 64 regions on a single simulator is definitely a stretch, I think.  You might want to check what the difference is between your empty sims and the one with data.

      I believe there is scope for better memory efficiency in OpenSimulator but it might be difficult to make really huge savings.  Unlike a web-server, OpenSimulator (and many other VE systems) has to keep data permanently in memory for speed of response.

        Now I have a lot more I want to add to my grid. I currently run all that you see in my tag lines.

        Opensim User: Standalone Grid on Version 0.7.3.1 with 56 Regions
        on Windows 7, 64-bit. Phenom 9500 2.2 ghz Quad Core, Terabyte Hard
        Drive, 8gig DDR2 RAM. Used XAMPP to load PHP Version 5.3.0, Apache
        and MySQL 5.1.41-community edition. Groups, Profiles, Voice and
        Offline Mesages all working. (Not yet Public, 6 users allowed Now).

        I only have one sim with much on it, I was planning on making the other sims well forested and a couple more villages
        and then Shuri Castle from Okinawa in the middle. The reason for 56 regions was to make a nice 1.5 mile landscape all
        the way around the castle and surrounding villages.

        Am I expecting to much of my system and Opensim to be able to do this on one computer. I plan to eventually upgrade to a
        32 gig DDR3, am3+ bulldozer motherboard. Looking at what little it took to fill over 6 gig of ram, I am worried after I
        save up a while and get the upgrade that it won't be enough to do all the things I dream of.

        Am I over reaching? I thought opensim even in 64bit used some disk cashing, and wouldn't use all the available ram? I
        still want to be able to do other things with my machine while running my grid. Seems I can't always do that without a
        shutdown a program warning from windows 7.

        Info is welcome.
