That's correct.  You could authenticate using the circuit code for the client's UDP connection if you're able to 
retrieve that from the viewer (I appreciate that might be a little tricky).  You could also pass in the same password 
details used by your client to the module and call IAuthenticationService.Authenticate() (this is the approach taken by 
the 'load iar' command in the InventoryArchiverModule).

</I>&gt;<i> Thanks, I found the region module wiki documentation could have had more examples, but it was great to have what was there.

Yes, it's not ideal but to be honest we're lucky there's any doc at all ;).  A good source of information, I find, are 
also the modules already included with OpenSimulator.
