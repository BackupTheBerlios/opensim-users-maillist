<PRE>Hi,

This will sound like a viewer question, and I understand this is not the
right place to ask viewer questions, but I am trying to determine if
OpenSim will allow a single user account be logged in twice concurrently
from two different clients. I think it doesn't allow this, but I might be
missing something that would enable it.

I'm working on a project to integrate Kinect gestures to control avatar
actions in OpenSim.

I have a working prototype which runs as a region module (DLL) in
standalone OpenSim mode.
We would like to expand on this by allowing the client use the Kinect and
sent the commands remotely to the server.

Initially I hoped to find an existing viewer that had a plugin architecture
where I could integrate the Kinect code, but I haven't found any clients
like this.
I have two options as I see it:
1. Fork an existing client and add the Kinect code (overkill).
2. Write a minimal OpenMetaverse library based client that has no viewer
but sends avatar commands to a client.

I have already coded a tiny, non-viewer proof of concept
OpenMetaverse/Kinect client, but I hit the problem that only other accounts
can see the resulting actions on the avatar.
If I log in with Hippo, say,  to the same account, it logs out the Kinect
client, and vice versa.
This is good and proper normal function for a server, but as this is a
special case, I thought there might be a way to enable multiple concurrent
login on a single account on the server?

Regards,

Stephen
