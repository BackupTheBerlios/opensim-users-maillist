<PRE>Very cool to hear about this.

To my constant surprise, it is possible to log in the same avatar multiple times on the same grid [1].  However, it's 
certainly not currently possible to log two agents for the same user into the same region or neighbouring regions (since 
child/root agents would interfere with each other).

I would say your best bet would be to do this with a region module [2] that detected the logged in root ScenePresences 
(the OpenSimulator class that handles your avatar in sim) and added http handlers that could receive external HTTP 
requests to manipulate a certain avatar (by caling through to animations code).

Unfortunately, the internals of OpenSimulator are very hairy since they've evolved from a place where only external 
clients needed to be able to perform these operations.  However, if you want any help exploring the codebase we're very 
happy to provide it via this list or the in-world IRC channels, though that does depend on whether the right people are 
around at the time.

I think you could also do this by placing an LSL script in the simulator that registered lslhttp handlers to receive the 
commands and then invoking OSSL functions [3] such as osAvatarPlayAnimation and osAvatarStopAnimation to manipulate the 
appropriate avatar.  However, this would rely on having that script in every region I think (though conversely the 
region module approach requires that you have that region module in every simulator).

</I>&gt;<i> 1. Fork an existing client and add the Kinect code (overkill).
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Write a minimal OpenMetaverse library based client that has no viewer but sends avatar commands to a client.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have already coded a tiny, non-viewer proof of concept OpenMetaverse/Kinect client, but I hit the problem that only
</I>&gt;<i> other accounts can see the resulting actions on the avatar.
</I>&gt;<i> If I log in with Hippo, say,  to the same account, it logs out the Kinect client, and vice versa.
</I>&gt;<i> This is good and proper normal function for a server, but as this is a special case, I thought there might be a way to
</I>&gt;<i> enable multiple concurrent login on a single account on the server?
