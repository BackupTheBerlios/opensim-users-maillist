Thanks Justin, I am only developing the Kinect plugin, the project is for
the very cool folks in <A HREF="http://missionv.ie/">http://missionv.ie/</A> who have an OpenSim project with
primary schools in Ireland.


&gt;<i> To my constant surprise, it is possible to log in the same avatar multiple
</I>&gt;<i> times on the same grid [1].  However, it's certainly not currently possible
</I>&gt;<i> to log two agents for the same user into the same region or neighbouring
</I>&gt;<i> regions (since child/root agents would interfere with each other).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Thanks for that link. The fact that I connected twice and saw myself logged
out of the first connection could be down to the server configuration or
the way I connected perhaps?


&gt;<i> I would say your best bet would be to do this with a region module [2]
</I>&gt;<i> that detected the logged in root ScenePresences (the OpenSimulator class
</I>&gt;<i> that handles your avatar in sim) and added http handlers that could receive
</I>&gt;<i> external HTTP requests to manipulate a certain avatar (by caling through to
</I>&gt;<i> animations code).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I have developed a working Kinect controller region module. My
understanding from your comment is that I could place the dll on the server
and it act as a mini-server (inside the OpenSim server) taking HTTP
requests and running them directly against a specified avatar. The OpenSim
server wouldn't kick the first logged in avatar because no actual 'logging
in' would take place a second time. I would presumably have to build
in authentication as otherwise it would be a potential security hole.


&gt;<i> Unfortunately, the internals of OpenSimulator are very hairy since they've
</I>&gt;<i> evolved from a place where only external clients needed to be able to
</I>&gt;<i> perform these operations.  However, if you want any help exploring the
</I>&gt;<i> codebase we're very happy to provide it via this list or the in-world IRC
</I>&gt;<i> channels, though that does depend on whether the right people are around at
</I>&gt;<i> the time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Thanks, I found the region module wiki documentation could have had more
examples, but it was great to have what was there.


&gt;<i> I think you could also do this by placing an LSL script in the simulator
</I>&gt;<i> that registered lslhttp handlers to receive the commands and then invoking
</I>&gt;<i> OSSL functions [3] such as osAvatarPlayAnimation and osAvatarStopAnimation
</I>&gt;<i> to manipulate the appropriate avatar.  However, this would rely on having
</I>&gt;<i> that script in every region I think (though conversely the region module
</I>&gt;<i> approach requires that you have that region module in every simulator).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Interesting, I'll investigate that too.

Thanks for the reply and the links.
