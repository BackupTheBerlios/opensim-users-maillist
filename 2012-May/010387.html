<PRE>I'm very surprised at the big difference between actual heap allocation (883 mb) and actual process allocation (6193mb). 
  You might want to monitor memory usage over time - it might be that some kind of peak in heap has put the process 
memory up to a permanently higher level.

Unfortunately, memory usage on OpenSimulator will go up and down quite a bit as many objects are allocated before the GC 
kicks in.

That said, 64 regions on a single simulator is definitely a stretch, I think.  You might want to check what the 
difference is between your empty sims and the one with data.

I believe there is scope for better memory efficiency in OpenSimulator but it might be difficult to make really huge 
savings.  Unlike a web-server, OpenSimulator (and many other VE systems) has to keep data permanently in memory for 
speed of response.
