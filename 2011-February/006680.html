Which database are you using?  If it's SQLite then you'll need to switch to MySQL, which is far quicker.  However, with 
large numbers of prims there will be other factors that impact on performance, such as the viewer machine's graphics 
hardware.

If you're using bleeding edge code or a recent osgrid distro then I'm not sure how accurate prim count is at the moment. 
  Apparantly, the region count is accurate but parcel counts are not.

Also, in the OpenSim.log, you can search for the phrase &quot;Loaded x objects using y prims&quot; which will be somewhere in the 
startup.  This will tell you how many prims are actually being pulled from the database.
