</I>Both Ken and Justin are correct.  The only reliable way is to manually 
alter the DB tables.  It's actually not terribly complicated and I've 
done it may times.  Just create, via console command, a user with the 
same name in the new OS instance.  With the new bare-bones inventory and 
attributes now added to the DB you can begin replacing references to the 
new UUID with whatever the old UUID value was.  I'm not making any 
assumptions as to your familiarity/comfort level with manually editing 
DB tables, but if you want a friendly GUI that is more elegant that the 
standard phpMyAdmin interface, you might want to try MySQLBuddy - 
<A HREF="http://http://www.sqlbuddy.com.">http://http://www.sqlbuddy.com.</A>  It's all just cutting and pasting from 
then on.

NOTE: Make all of the changes (there really aren't that many) BEFORE you 
import any previous inventory .iar files.  Once the main identity values 
are changed, any subsequent imported assets will inherit the new UUID 
for ownership.  Also, I'm not sure what OpenSim version you're running, 
but if it's 0.7.x the main tables you need to be concerned with are:

auth (UUID field)
useraccounts (PrincipleID field)
inventoryfolders (agentID field)
estate_settings (EstateOwner field)

Hope this helps.  Good luck and happy hacking...
