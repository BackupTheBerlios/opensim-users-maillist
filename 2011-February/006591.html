<PRE>I have used the Phoenix viewer since it came out.  I've had no issues 
before with it.  I like its long list of options, and before all the 
jokes come flooding in, yes the breast physics too. But recently I seem 
to be having issues with my grid's database becoming corrupted.  The 
corruption is not in a form that prevents things from loading or 
running.  It only, as I can tell, effects attachments.

I run 49 regions, on a quad core 2.2 MHz with 8 gig and 1.7 gig HD on 
Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit the only resent change was the Phoenix 
updated to version 1.5.2. (818).

As of yet, it was all looking fine, I made several AVs and plan on more 
to give out to visitors when I eventually open to the public.  The 
problem shows up when changing from one AV to another.  I use both an 
copy of Hippo and Phoenix for testing.  Hippo don't have the problem, 
but when changing from one AV to another all the attachments I had on 
the newly chosen AV are all misplaced and all attached to the chest.  
This includes hair, shoes, belts and more.

When I saw that AV was messed up, I tried to return to the one I was 
wearing before.  Now that one is screwed up.  All attachments on the 
chest.  The only way to get all my AVs back to normal was to shutdown 
opensim, and restore MySQL to my last backup.  Then I could relog with 
hippo and all was back to normal.  It would seem that using Phoenix to 
change from one AV to the next completely ruins the database.

I know many of you will say, just change to Imprudence or something.  My 
point is.  If people in a griefer frame of mind know it is that simple 
to ruin the opensim database, won't they just come in with Phoenix to 
ruin all our databases?

Is this a known issues being worked on for version 7.1 soon?  Am I the 
only one?  Is there a known fix?  Please help.

Sorry so long a message,
Thanks for your time, I appreciate it Immensely
