<PRE>
I have been trying to get IRCbridge module working for quite a while now and
I'm not getting anywhere, so I'd really appreciate it if anyone could point
me in the right direction.

Techincal info:
Opensim version: test (r14959)
OS: Debian lenny
Mode: grid (osgrid)
Hypergrid: yes
Extra module: moneyserver

I have tried several .ini configurations, this is what I have now:


;[IRC]  
    enabled = true
    server  = irc.quickfox.net
    nick    = Bridgebot
    channel = #phoenixrising
    user    = &quot;Opensim IRC bridgebot&quot;
    port = 6667
    commands_enabled = false
    command_channel = 2772
    report_clients = true
    relay_private_channels = false
    relay_chat = true   
    fallback_region = Phoenix Rising Isles
    msgformat = &quot;PRIVMSG {0} :&lt;{1} in {2}&gt;: {3}&quot;

One time only it changed the topic of my IRC channel to: &quot;Regions: ONLINE
Website: OFFLINE, IrcBride: OFFLINE&quot; but I have never been able to reproduce
that. 

I have checked the logfiles and IRCbridge is started for every region, I
have also tried to start it from console like any other module, as according
to itself, ircbridge was offline, I have tried enabling commands and sending
it connect commands from my sim, but it doesn't change anything.

I have looked at the scource code too, but that didn't make me any wiser
either.

Oh, and apart from the startup messages and shutdown messages, there are no
logs for IRCbridge at all, no errors, no connect messages, nothing. 

Right now I suspect IRCbridge needs to be started or activated in some way,
but I can't find anything about it in google, nor do I see any obvious way
to do so.

Is this true? If yes, how do I activate it? If no, are there any other
things that I have overlooked?
Thanks in advance.
