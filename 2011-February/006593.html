</I>&gt;<i> The problem shows up when changing from one AV to another.  I use both

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When I saw that AV was messed up, I tried to return to the one I was

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> Phoenix to ruin all our databases?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is this a known issues being worked on for version 7.1 soon?  Am I the 
</I>&gt;<i> only one?  Is there a known fix?  Please help.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry so long a message,

Are you using Phoenix Viewer version 725 or higher? Phoenix 725 and 
higher implements the attachment stacking of the viewer 2 series. As far 
as I know OS does NOT support this server side yet. When you &quot;add&quot; an 
attachment or an entire folder with the newer Phoenix viewers, it will 
actually stack the attachments instead of wear them. Since OS does not 
support this, it will show up in the form of all your attachments 
attaching to the chest by default, zero rotation, and default 
positioning. Unfortunately there is no way (that I know of) to revert 
the newer Phoenixes to the old way of attaching things. You will need to 
use Phoenix 373 or lower for now.
