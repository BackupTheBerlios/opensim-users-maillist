<PRE>Has this been reported in the opensim Mantis tracker or the Phoenix viewer
Jira?

&gt;<i>  I have used the Phoenix viewer since it came out.  I've had no issues
</I>&gt;<i> before with it.  I like its long list of options, and before all the jokes
</I>&gt;<i> come flooding in, yes the breast physics too. But recently I seem to be
</I>&gt;<i> having issues with my grid's database becoming corrupted.  The corruption is
</I>&gt;<i> not in a form that prevents things from loading or running.  It only, as I
</I>&gt;<i> can tell, effects attachments.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I run 49 regions, on a quad core 2.2 MHz with 8 gig and 1.7 gig HD on
</I>&gt;<i> Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit the only resent change was the Phoenix updated
</I>&gt;<i> to version 1.5.2. (818).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As of yet, it was all looking fine, I made several AVs and plan on more to
</I>&gt;<i> give out to visitors when I eventually open to the public.  The problem
</I>&gt;<i> shows up when changing from one AV to another.  I use both an copy of Hippo
</I>&gt;<i> and Phoenix for testing.  Hippo don't have the problem, but when changing
</I>&gt;<i> from one AV to another all the attachments I had on the newly chosen AV are
</I>&gt;<i> all misplaced and all attached to the chest.  This includes hair, shoes,
</I>&gt;<i> belts and more.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When I saw that AV was messed up, I tried to return to the one I was
</I>&gt;<i> wearing before.  Now that one is screwed up.  All attachments on the chest.
</I>&gt;<i> The only way to get all my AVs back to normal was to shutdown opensim, and
</I>&gt;<i> restore MySQL to my last backup.  Then I could relog with hippo and all was
</I>&gt;<i> back to normal.  It would seem that using Phoenix to change from one AV to
</I>&gt;<i> the next completely ruins the database.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I know many of you will say, just change to Imprudence or something.  My
</I>&gt;<i> point is.  If people in a griefer frame of mind know it is that simple to
</I>&gt;<i> ruin the opensim database, won't they just come in with Phoenix to ruin all
</I>&gt;<i> our databases?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is this a known issues being worked on for version 7.1 soon?  Am I the only
</I>&gt;<i> one?  Is there a known fix?  Please help.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry so long a message,
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for your time, I appreciate it Immensely
