<PRE>Hi all,

I'm attempting to get 0.7.0.2 running in grid mode on our campus Win2008
servers and I can't figure out for the life of me what's wrong.

I've got FleepGrid running 0.7.0.2 on WinXP in grid mode at home, the only
other difference is that FleepGrid is all on a single physical machine, and
the campus grid is running on two separate virtual machines.  This is the
first time I've tried setting up a grid where the grid services are on a
different (virtual) machine than the simulators.  At the moment, I am just
trying to get everything working properly on the university's internal
network.

This morning when I first installed everything, it seemed to go fine.  I
successfully created a user &quot;Fleep Tuque&quot; through ROBUST console.  I added
the first region &quot;University of Cincinnati&quot; to the region.ini file.  I
logged in.  All seemed well.  I rezzed a prim, stored in inventory, attached
to head to test attachment points.  Still good, I see everything coming
through on the console.  I upload an OAR file with our campus build in
progress, still all good - everything seems to load properly, it looks right
in-world.  I'm thinking yay, all good at least on the internal network.

I go away for a few hours.  Come back, create some new accounts on the
ROBUST console to get my staff all set up, and then try to login myself and
get this on the ROBUST console:

10:59:51 - [GRID HANDLER]: Exception System.NullReferenceException: Object
refer
ence not set to an instance of an object.
11:01:33 - [LLOGIN SERVICE]: Login request for Fleep Tuque from
10.24.146.106 wi
th user agent Imprudence 1.3.0  / Second Life 1.23.5.136262 starting in last
11:01:33 - [LLOGIN SERVICE]: Login failed, reason: user not found

Things I've tried so far:

1.  Shutting down opensim and ROBUST and restarting.  No love.

2.  Double checking the database connection string in PRIM STORAGE section
opensim.ini

storage_plugin=&quot;OpenSim.Data.MySQL.dll&quot;
    storage_connection_string=&quot;Data
Source=10.23.23.148;Database=opensim;User ID=opensim;Password=MYPASSWORD;&quot;

3.  Changing the URLs in gridcommon.ini to IP addresses instead of FQDN (one
example, they all say the same thing):

WAS

[UserAccountService]
    ;
    ; change this to your grid-wide user accounts server
    ;
    UserAccountServerURI = &quot;<A HREF="http://ucsim.uc.edu:8003">http://ucsim.uc.edu:8003</A>&quot;

NOW

[UserAccountService]
    ;
    ; change this to your grid-wide user accounts server
    ;
    UserAccountServerURI = &quot;<A HREF="http://10.23.23.148:8003">http://10.23.23.148:8003</A>&quot;  &lt;--- Machine where
ROBUST and MySQL are running


Still no luck.  So my questions are:

1.  What does this error mean:  11:24:24 - [GRID HANDLER]: Exception
System.NullReferenceException: Object refer
ence not set to an instance of an object.

2.  Why is ROBUST not seeing that the user exists in the database?

3.  Why was I successfully able to login initially but not now?  What
changed?  (That is, I'm pretty sure I didn't change anything between my last
successful login and my first unsuccessful login.)


Any help much appreciated!

Sincerely,

- Chris/Fleep
