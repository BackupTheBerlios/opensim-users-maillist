<PRE>After spending a quiet afternoon building something out of entirely
passive prims, OpenSim (latest version, run locally, with hippo
viewer) was dragging my computer to molasses-level performance. I
looked in About Land and it said I had used 30,000 prims!

I restarted hippo and it couldn't even connect!
Then I issued the shutdown command and it took 3 or 4 hours to finish :P
After relaunching OpenSim (and hippo), it was still under the
impression that I had used over 9000 prims, which is probably an order
of magnitude above my actual usage!
WTF... is there anything I can do about this?

These prims were nowhere in sight to be deleted and didn't show up
when everything else was highlighted by the parcel tools.
Using the Radegast &quot;sensor&quot; with 1000m range there was also nothing
special listed...

Thanks!

Jorge / Eggy
