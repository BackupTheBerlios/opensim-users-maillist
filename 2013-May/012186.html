<PRE>Dear Justin and the Team;


I am not even sure how possible this would be,  because, I don't know if 
the client is to blame, or basic old SL disfunction.

I have been bulding many things on my grid, including a boat where the 
mopst aanoying thing happens.  I also build a bridge that does the same 
thing because I added animated poses to the rails.  Many sitable items 
have this issue, but those are the most annoying by far.  When I use the 
usual lllsittarget commands if I then use the onscreen button to unsit 
the object flings you high into the sky. Only on boats and bridges does 
this result in an even more annoying thing,.  This will toss you right 
out of an emmersive environment, You can imagine how had it is to get 
back into the scene or character after unsit throws your Avatar high 
into the sky and into the water.  We have all seen this before I know.  
What I am not sure of is, what am I fighting here?  Bad functionality of 
sit target, or how the client unsits a person?  Could the addition of a 
new form of sittarget be replaced or augmented by a sort of OSSittaarget 
be used to cure this?  Maybe this is our chance to cure this mess in 
opensim.  Might I even venture to add a  OSStandtarget that will let a 
user unsit and turn to face a direction and place the sitter near the 
ground next to, or where ever a scripter chooses, without the initial fling?

I have a Japanese kneeling animation I made from scratch.  Used it as a 
gesture.  It don't use sit target.  As a gesture I set it to start if I 
want to sit in a home or outside and look good doing it. Unlike most 
animations that you see it moves the legs and body in a slow movement to 
get down on the floor or ground.  Most poses just stick you down, like a 
bean bag being dropped with what I can imagine would be a loud smack as 
you hit the floor, and sticks a user in a kneeling position.  This 
animation is animated on a loop, then eventually ends in another slowly 
getting back up.  I wasn't lazy about this animation.  I have some more 
adjusting before it is perfect, but slowly gets a person back into a 
standing pose by adjusting fet and legs to move you up.  It don't just 
spring a person off the ground.   I uploaded this with a small loop 
within. I made the loop start once the avatar is sitting down then loops 
back to that point before the avatar starts to stand.  So, now I have an 
endless loop of movements and hand gestures and rocking a big until you 
hit the button combo to stand back up.  That gesture simply ends the 
animation.  Using that method produces a complete and last loop and 
stands the avatar back into position to walk away.

In my case CTRL-F12 knels and SHIFT-F12 stands.  It is easy to remember 
and works smooth.  I was hoping to use that same animation for a tea 
room with zabuton.  A zabuton is generally a pad used by the Japanese 
and other Asian cultures to sit more comfortably on the floor.  I added 
a simple sit script to the zabuton with my animation.  The animation 
starts just fine.  Other then the flaw also I blame SL for.  Some reason 
the animation are thrown way off by different hights.  I will get to 
that in a moment.  As I was saying it starts out fine.  My avatar is all 
down mice and slow. Once down it does its loop as expected.  Another 
friend can come sit acros the table on the other side.  Later when we 
are done talking, I hit the button to get up slowly as expected and I am 
flung into the rafters.  Then I ended up standing, and facing the 
direction of the camera, on top of the zabuton, back in the kneeling 
position. At that point then it continued getting up slowly.  It would 
have been perfect if I didn't make that giant leap and turn before I 
finished the animation.

I have had the opportunity to be told the hows and whys on some reasons 
it does this. Someone told me once it was to prevent avatars from 
getting stuck within items once they stand.  MY responce to them is not 
if you're a decent enough scripter and also choose to stand in a 
targeted posiion  that is not inside the object you just stood up on.  
We should have that chance.

I think if possible this might be a chance to fix all that in Opensim 
code.  That is if it isn't all the fault of the client side unsit command.

As for height effecting sit position: It would be nice if SL and Opensim 
allowed scripters to add some code to not only check for permissions 
before sitting, but allow a bit more coding like the ability to do a 
avatar height check before setting a sit target position.  In this way 
giants who try to sit on objects that would, otherwise, poke the heads 
of &quot;Too Tall&quot; a mesage about being to tall to sit here.  This could be 
used to lower shorter avatar to have the sit target moved down before 
sitting on the object to prevent massive hovering.

I am sorry if this sounds like a rant about a long time messed up sit 
problem.  WelI, it could be taken that way as I type this at after 1am 
my local time..  ;)
I  was thinking this would be a great improvement over how SL does 
things, if this was delt with.  I always assumed the Opensim project 
would be an improvment on SL, this would be a huge step in that direction.

Always your friend,  I always am amazed at what the team has 
accomplished so far.
I appreciate it to no end.  Believe me this project has given me 
something to do with my life.
It gives me something to do when I am not to sick and useless.
