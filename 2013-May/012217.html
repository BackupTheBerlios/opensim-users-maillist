<PRE>I just downloaded and set up a fresh 0.7.5.  The problem I have experienced before of not being able to sit or use any poseballs is back.  When I even click on something scripted that would bring up a menu that doesn't do anything either.  I brought up the sweetness AO and clicked on it and nothing happen.  I drop some poseballs known to work in opensim and try to sit on one.  Default sit pose and no way to make the poseball work.  If I take an anim and play it in world it arbitrarily stops working after a short time as if some AO was on when none is.  

Very odd and very annoying.  Any ideas how to escape this?  I am running the latest opensim version of Firestorm on a Mac.  My opensim installation is on ubuntu.  The Firestorm version and such is working fine when I visit Kitely worlds or osgrid or SL.  

Ideas?  Places to look?
