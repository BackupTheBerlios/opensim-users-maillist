<PRE>I was noticing while testing master that sometimes when starting OpenSim 
up that it is refusing to load scripts for some or all regions at start 
up. Once every thing is loaded up and the console is ready, running the 
'login status' command it shows that some regions are enabled login, and 
some aren't. In order to login the 'login enable' command must be ran 
first. Once logged in it seems that no script will run on the regions 
that have not had their scripts loaded at start up, including 
attachments, or newly rezzed objects. Had a closer look at the console 
out put and was noticing that there are a lot of warnings dealing with 
objects I have rezzed in world that are mesh similar to below:

WARN  - OpenSim.Region.Physics.Meshing.Meshmerizer [MESH]: No recognized 
physics mesh found in mesh asset for 
chair/c861affd-17b4-4b3c-9535-f1986ab394a9

I found that if I tracked these objects down and removed them from the 
region and then restarted OpenSim, there's a bit better chance for 
scripts to be loaded properly. If I put the objects back out again and 
restart OpenSim then it starts to randomly not want to load scripts in 
random regions at start up. Setting DeleteScriptsOnStartup = true in 
OpenSim.ini or deleteing the ScriptEngines folder prior to start up also 
seems to give better success at having scripts load properly. It might 
be just my imagination and coincidence that it is working in this way 
but it is my observation.

Noticed that the console seems to hang for a bit (a couple seconds) 
before outputting warnings on these objects with high CPU use. I'm just 
speculating on this since I'm not entirely knowledgeable on how things 
work but... could there possibly be some kind of race condition 
somewhere preventing scripts from loading properly in this case?

A couple of my regions have 0 scripts on them; not sure if it matters or 
not.

I normally run OpenSim with these script related settings:
AppDomainLoading = false
DeleteScriptsOnStartup = false
EventLimit = 500
ScriptDelayFactor = 0.0
AllowScriptCrossing = true
TrustBinaries = true

Is anyone else seeing this?

Thanks!
