<PRE>Hello everyone. I do hope somebody can shed light on a problem I am having.

I successfully set up a hypergrid enabled sim last year, using SKY broadband
and it's supplied router.
The Grid and sims ran very well, and I set up 7 regions. The router
correctly NAT Looped back to allow me to log in myself, and my friends could
log in from around the world and help me build. Group module and voice were
not installed. 

Noticing lag was starting to build as the sims filled with objects, I
decided to switch ISP to BT and the fibre optic Infinity option 2, which
gives me an 80mb DL / 20mb UL. 

BT Supplied a home hub 3 router version A and when I first set it up, all
port forwarding was dead in the water. 

However, after 7 days a firmware update arrived and some partial success has
followed. It now reports firmware as Software version 4.7.5.1.83.8.94.1.11
(Type A).

I followed the advice on one of BT's help forums for setting up port
forwarding, using the suggested static ethernet based LAN ip of 192.168.1.50

Now, bear in mind opensim worked perfectly well before switchover to new
ISP, and no changes have been made to it's files.

The dynamic ip is handled by No-Ip and again worked very well with the old
ISP.

When I boot up opensim via terminal on my iMac, I use 2 windows. First comes
the ROBUST, which loads flawlessly. A port checker reveals at end of boot
up, ports 8002 to 8004 are now open.

Now it gets muddy.

Using the second terminal window to 'mono Opensim.exe' starts the region
boot up well, but then it slows down and stalls at one point. After about a
minute the following lines appear;

19:06:39 - [FORMS]: exception occured POST

19:06:39 - [ACCOUNT CONNECTOR]: GetUserAccount received null or empty reply

The boot up then continues, slowing now and then to report messages such as

19:08:34 - [SynchronousRestObjectRequester]: Slow request to &lt;27&gt; POST
<A HREF="http://dreamgrid.no-ip.org:8003/assets/">http://dreamgrid.no-ip.org:8003/assets/</A> took 35157ms, 35017ms writing,

xmlns:xsi=&quot;<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instan">http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instan</A>

You can see from the time stamps the amount of time lapsed and it hasnt got
to the end yet. Before on my old system the entire thing booted to the end
in less than a minute.

A couple of red lines appear, stating
19:13:34 - [WATCHDOG]: Timeout detected for thread &quot;Heartbeat (LMF)&quot;.
ThreadState=WaitSleepJoin. Last tick was 39155ms ago.  
19:13:39 - [WATCHDOG]: Timeout detected for thread &quot;Heartbeat (Liston)&quot;.
ThreadState=WaitSleepJoin. Last tick was 5906ms ago.

The names in brackets are of course the region names.

2 final bits of info that may help solve this. The port checker reveals port
9000 is open, which is the base region, but all ports above are reporting as
closed.
Secondly, when I log in, I am just an orange cloud and cannot move at all.

Any thoughts are feedback would be very much appreciated.
