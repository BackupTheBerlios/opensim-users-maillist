<PRE>Whoops... Hit the send button a bit too early :)

In addition to the testing done in the previous post, I found that it 
seems like the only option that seems to more consistently let all 
regions load their scripts is to set DeleteScriptsOnStartup back to 
true; in this case both my systems load all scripts on their regions on 
both databases... But it significantly slows down startup due to having 
to compile all the scripts which is the reason I usually set it to false.

&gt;<i> Hi Justin,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm running 11 regions in Standalone (No HG) configuration. 5 of those 
</I>&gt;<i> regions do not have any scripts to be loaded on them and very few 
</I>&gt;<i> prims to load.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I disabled 5 regions, leaving 6 regions to load at start up, restarted 
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim a few times (I always shut OpenSim down completely and then 
</I>&gt;<i> restart it from the exe file rather than use the restart command), but 
</I>&gt;<i> found that it doesn't seem to make a difference in script start up.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Set async_call_method = UnsafeQueueUserWorkItem in OpenSim.ini and 
</I>&gt;<i> restarted OpenSim a few times. From what I can see, setting this seems 
</I>&gt;<i> to make the issue appear more frequently, and on more regions than 
</I>&gt;<i> with using default setting; though this could just be coincidence as I 
</I>&gt;<i> set it back to SmartThreadPool and tried again with similar results.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Set TrustBinaries = false with no noticable improvement.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Set ScriptDelayFactor = 1.0 with no noticable improvement.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I also tried one extra thing, setting AppDomainLoading = false, but 
</I>&gt;<i> this didn't seem to have noticeable improvement.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The issue seems to show up randomly and will pick random region(s) to 
</I>&gt;<i> not load scripts for on start up. It's a slightly older commit but I 
</I>&gt;<i> don't see the issue showing up in 3611d33 (r/22387) with all my 
</I>&gt;<i> regions enabled and the script settings reported earlier set.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ran these tests on two different machines with two different databases 
</I>&gt;<i> with different content to load.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> async_call_method = UnsafeQueueUserWorkItem
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in [Startup] on OpenSim.ini make any difference? (this uses the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> system pool for threads rather than a separate SmartThreadPool 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> instance)?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also, does setting TrustBinaries = false make any difference? This is 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the one relatively unusual setting you have below.  You could also 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> try specifying a non zero ScriptDelayFactor in case some script is 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> managing to hog CPU.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I was noticing while testing master that sometimes when starting 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> OpenSim up that it is refusing to load scripts for some
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> or all regions at start up. Once every thing is loaded up and the 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> console is ready, running the 'login status' command
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> it shows that some regions are enabled login, and some aren't. In 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> order to login the 'login enable' command must be ran
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> first. Once logged in it seems that no script will run on the 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> regions that have not had their scripts loaded at start
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> up, including attachments, or newly rezzed objects. Had a closer 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> look at the console out put and was noticing that there
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> are a lot of warnings dealing with objects I have rezzed in world 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that are mesh similar to below:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> WARN  - OpenSim.Region.Physics.Meshing.Meshmerizer [MESH]: No 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> recognized physics mesh found in mesh asset for
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> chair/c861affd-17b4-4b3c-9535-f1986ab394a9
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I found that if I tracked these objects down and removed them from 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the region and then restarted OpenSim, there's a bit
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> better chance for scripts to be loaded properly. If I put the 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> objects back out again and restart OpenSim then it starts
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to randomly not want to load scripts in random regions at start up. 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Setting DeleteScriptsOnStartup = true in OpenSim.ini
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> or deleteing the ScriptEngines folder prior to start up also seems 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to give better success at having scripts load
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> properly. It might be just my imagination and coincidence that it is 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> working in this way but it is my observation.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Noticed that the console seems to hang for a bit (a couple seconds) 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> before outputting warnings on these objects with
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> high CPU use. I'm just speculating on this since I'm not entirely 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> knowledgeable on how things work but... could there
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> possibly be some kind of race condition somewhere preventing scripts 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> from loading properly in this case?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> A couple of my regions have 0 scripts on them; not sure if it 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> matters or not.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I normally run OpenSim with these script related settings:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> AppDomainLoading = false
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> DeleteScriptsOnStartup = false
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> EventLimit = 500
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ScriptDelayFactor = 0.0
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> AllowScriptCrossing = true
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> TrustBinaries = true
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Is anyone else seeing this?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks!
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
