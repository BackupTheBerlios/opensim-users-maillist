<PRE>This could probably really be relieved by stopping standing from flinging the avatar.  However, I suspect this is 
entangled a little with other changes (e.g. offsetting all sits from a root prim rather than child prims) which are 
better made first.

</I>&gt;<i> I am not even sure how possible this would be,  because, I don't know if the client is to blame, or basic old SL

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have been bulding many things on my grid, including a boat where the mopst aanoying thing happens.  I also build a
</I>&gt;<i> bridge that does the same thing because I added animated poses to the rails.  Many sitable items have this issue, but
</I>&gt;<i> those are the most annoying by far.  When I use the usual lllsittarget commands if I then use the onscreen button to
</I>&gt;<i> unsit the object flings you high into the sky. Only on boats and bridges does this result in an even more annoying
</I>&gt;<i> thing,.  This will toss you right out of an emmersive environment, You can imagine how had it is to get back into the
</I>&gt;<i> scene or character after unsit throws your Avatar high into the sky and into the water.  We have all seen this before I
</I>&gt;<i> know. What I am not sure of is, what am I fighting here?  Bad functionality of sit target, or how the client unsits a
</I>&gt;<i> person?  Could the addition of a new form of sittarget be replaced or augmented by a sort of OSSittaarget be used to
</I>&gt;<i> cure this?  Maybe this is our chance to cure this mess in opensim.  Might I even venture to add a  OSStandtarget that
</I>&gt;<i> will let a user unsit and turn to face a direction and place the sitter near the ground next to, or where ever a
</I>&gt;<i> scripter chooses, without the initial fling?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have a Japanese kneeling animation I made from scratch.  Used it as a gesture.  It don't use sit target.  As a gesture
</I>&gt;<i> I set it to start if I want to sit in a home or outside and look good doing it. Unlike most animations that you see it
</I>&gt;<i> moves the legs and body in a slow movement to get down on the floor or ground.  Most poses just stick you down, like a
</I>&gt;<i> bean bag being dropped with what I can imagine would be a loud smack as you hit the floor, and sticks a user in a
</I>&gt;<i> kneeling position.  This animation is animated on a loop, then eventually ends in another slowly getting back up.  I
</I>&gt;<i> wasn't lazy about this animation.  I have some more adjusting before it is perfect, but slowly gets a person back into a
</I>&gt;<i> standing pose by adjusting fet and legs to move you up.  It don't just spring a person off the ground.   I uploaded this
</I>&gt;<i> with a small loop within. I made the loop start once the avatar is sitting down then loops back to that point before the
</I>&gt;<i> avatar starts to stand.  So, now I have an endless loop of movements and hand gestures and rocking a big until you hit
</I>&gt;<i> the button combo to stand back up.  That gesture simply ends the animation.  Using that method produces a complete and
</I>&gt;<i> last loop and stands the avatar back into position to walk away.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In my case CTRL-F12 knels and SHIFT-F12 stands.  It is easy to remember and works smooth.  I was hoping to use that same
</I>&gt;<i> animation for a tea room with zabuton.  A zabuton is generally a pad used by the Japanese and other Asian cultures to
</I>&gt;<i> sit more comfortably on the floor.  I added a simple sit script to the zabuton with my animation.  The animation starts
</I>&gt;<i> just fine.  Other then the flaw also I blame SL for.  Some reason the animation are thrown way off by different hights.
</I>&gt;<i> I will get to that in a moment.  As I was saying it starts out fine.  My avatar is all down mice and slow. Once down it
</I>&gt;<i> does its loop as expected.  Another friend can come sit acros the table on the other side.  Later when we are done
</I>&gt;<i> talking, I hit the button to get up slowly as expected and I am flung into the rafters.  Then I ended up standing, and
</I>&gt;<i> facing the direction of the camera, on top of the zabuton, back in the kneeling position. At that point then it
</I>&gt;<i> continued getting up slowly.  It would have been perfect if I didn't make that giant leap and turn before I finished the
</I>&gt;<i> animation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have had the opportunity to be told the hows and whys on some reasons it does this. Someone told me once it was to
</I>&gt;<i> prevent avatars from getting stuck within items once they stand.  MY responce to them is not if you're a decent enough
</I>&gt;<i> scripter and also choose to stand in a targeted posiion  that is not inside the object you just stood up on. We should
</I>&gt;<i> have that chance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think if possible this might be a chance to fix all that in Opensim code.  That is if it isn't all the fault of the
</I>&gt;<i> client side unsit command.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for height effecting sit position: It would be nice if SL and Opensim allowed scripters to add some code to not only
</I>&gt;<i> check for permissions before sitting, but allow a bit more coding like the ability to do a avatar height check before
</I>&gt;<i> setting a sit target position.  In this way giants who try to sit on objects that would, otherwise, poke the heads of
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Too Tall&quot; a mesage about being to tall to sit here.  This could be used to lower shorter avatar to have the sit target
</I>&gt;<i> moved down before sitting on the object to prevent massive hovering.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am sorry if this sounds like a rant about a long time messed up sit problem.  WelI, it could be taken that way as I
</I>&gt;<i> type this at after 1am my local time..  ;)
</I>&gt;<i> I  was thinking this would be a great improvement over how SL does things, if this was delt with.  I always assumed the
</I>&gt;<i> Opensim project would be an improvment on SL, this would be a huge step in that direction.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Always your friend,  I always am amazed at what the team has accomplished so far.
</I>&gt;<i> I appreciate it to no end.  Believe me this project has given me something to do with my life.
</I>&gt;<i> It gives me something to do when I am not to sick and useless.
