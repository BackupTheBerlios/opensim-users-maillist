<PRE>Hi Justin,

I'm running 11 regions in Standalone (No HG) configuration. 5 of those 
regions do not have any scripts to be loaded on them and very few prims 
to load.

I disabled 5 regions, leaving 6 regions to load at start up, restarted 
OpenSim a few times (I always shut OpenSim down completely and then 
restart it from the exe file rather than use the restart command), but 
found that it doesn't seem to make a difference in script start up.

Set async_call_method = UnsafeQueueUserWorkItem in OpenSim.ini and 
restarted OpenSim a few times. From what I can see, setting this seems 
to make the issue appear more frequently, and on more regions than with 
using default setting; though this could just be coincidence as I set it 
back to SmartThreadPool and tried again with similar results.

Set TrustBinaries = false with no noticable improvement.

Set ScriptDelayFactor = 1.0 with no noticable improvement.

I also tried one extra thing, setting AppDomainLoading = false, but this 
didn't seem to have noticeable improvement.

The issue seems to show up randomly and will pick random region(s) to 
not load scripts for on start up. It's a slightly older commit but I 
don't see the issue showing up in 3611d33 (r/22387) with all my regions 
enabled and the script settings reported earlier set.

Ran these tests on two different machines with two different databases 
with different content to load.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to randomly not want to load scripts in random regions at start up.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or deleteing the ScriptEngines folder prior to start up also seems to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> give better success at having scripts load

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> working in this way but it is my observation.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Noticed that the console seems to hang for a bit (a couple seconds)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> possibly be some kind of race condition somewhere preventing scripts 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from loading properly in this case?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A couple of my regions have 0 scripts on them; not sure if it matters 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or not.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I normally run OpenSim with these script related settings:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> AppDomainLoading = false
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> DeleteScriptsOnStartup = false
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> EventLimit = 500
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ScriptDelayFactor = 0.0
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> AllowScriptCrossing = true
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> TrustBinaries = true
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is anyone else seeing this?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks!
