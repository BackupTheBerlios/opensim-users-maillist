<PRE>I've not heard any other reports of this yet though this doesn't necessarily mean anything.

How many regions are we talking about here?  What happens if you run fewer regions on one machine?  Does specifying

async_call_method = UnsafeQueueUserWorkItem

in [Startup] on OpenSim.ini make any difference? (this uses the system pool for threads rather than a separate 
SmartThreadPool instance)?

Also, does setting TrustBinaries = false make any difference?  This is the one relatively unusual setting you have 
below.  You could also try specifying a non zero ScriptDelayFactor in case some script is managing to hog CPU.

</I>&gt;<i> or deleteing the ScriptEngines folder prior to start up also seems to give better success at having scripts load

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Noticed that the console seems to hang for a bit (a couple seconds) before outputting warnings on these objects with
</I>&gt;<i> high CPU use. I'm just speculating on this since I'm not entirely knowledgeable on how things work but... could there
</I>&gt;<i> possibly be some kind of race condition somewhere preventing scripts from loading properly in this case?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A couple of my regions have 0 scripts on them; not sure if it matters or not.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I normally run OpenSim with these script related settings:
</I>&gt;<i> AppDomainLoading = false
</I>&gt;<i> DeleteScriptsOnStartup = false
</I>&gt;<i> EventLimit = 500
</I>&gt;<i> ScriptDelayFactor = 0.0
</I>&gt;<i> AllowScriptCrossing = true
</I>&gt;<i> TrustBinaries = true
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is anyone else seeing this?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks!
