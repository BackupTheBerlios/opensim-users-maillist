<PRE>I run apache as well, and have for years.  It works for me.  I tested it 
and tried to see my own site, in world and it appeared just fine but, 
not until after I corrected one mistake I made.  I also run AVG Virus 
protection.  I was visiting some friends, who have not yet joined me in 
my grid. One of those friends was trying to show a video on SL when my 
AVG popped up with a virus detected warning, saying it wanted to protect 
my identity.  I was in a hurry and wanted that warning out of my way so 
I could watch and said, &quot;YES&quot; protect me.  Then the video stopped 
working at all.

I assumed it was just another SL glitch, and in a couple of moments 
after, no movie for me, the others finished watching it anyways.  When I 
logged out of SL the window was still behind Firestorm.  The window 
said, it couldn't move the file, that turned out to be SLPlugin.exe to 
my virus vault until I rebooted. I logged out and rebooted and it seemed 
like all was fine.  Oh but it wasn't.  Media for Youtube used to work on 
my prim but now it didn't.  I then made the connection.  I restored 
SLPlugin.exe from the virus vault and well, now my Youtube worked and so 
did putting in my own web site and I could see it on the prim.

So what I am asking is are you running a virus program that is trying to 
protect your identity and placed SLPlugin.exe in some kind of space 
where you can no longer access it?

Trying to help,

InuYasha.
