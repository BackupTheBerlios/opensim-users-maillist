<PRE>I think this would be worth opening a Mantis for.  In particular, I'd be interested to see the results of &quot;show threads&quot; 
when this happens.  A VM thread dump would be ideal but that's a trickier proposition on Windows.

</I>&gt;<i> systems load all scripts on their regions on both databases... But it significantly slows down startup due to having to

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm running 11 regions in Standalone (No HG) configuration. 5 of those regions do not have any scripts to be loaded on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> them and very few prims to load.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I disabled 5 regions, leaving 6 regions to load at start up, restarted OpenSim a few times (I always shut OpenSim down
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> completely and then restart it from the exe file rather than use the restart command), but found that it doesn't seem
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to make a difference in script start up.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Set async_call_method = UnsafeQueueUserWorkItem in OpenSim.ini and restarted OpenSim a few times. From what I can see,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> setting this seems to make the issue appear more frequently, and on more regions than with using default setting;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> though this could just be coincidence as I set it back to SmartThreadPool and tried again with similar results.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Set TrustBinaries = false with no noticable improvement.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Set ScriptDelayFactor = 1.0 with no noticable improvement.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I also tried one extra thing, setting AppDomainLoading = false, but this didn't seem to have noticeable improvement.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The issue seems to show up randomly and will pick random region(s) to not load scripts for on start up. It's a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> slightly older commit but I don't see the issue showing up in 3611d33 (r/22387) with all my regions enabled and the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> script settings reported earlier set.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ran these tests on two different machines with two different databases with different content to load.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I've not heard any other reports of this yet though this doesn't necessarily mean anything.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> How many regions are we talking about here?  What happens if you run fewer regions on one machine?  Does specifying
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> async_call_method = UnsafeQueueUserWorkItem
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> in [Startup] on OpenSim.ini make any difference? (this uses the system pool for threads rather than a separate
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> SmartThreadPool instance)?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Also, does setting TrustBinaries = false make any difference? This is the one relatively unusual setting you have
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> below.  You could also try specifying a non zero ScriptDelayFactor in case some script is managing to hog CPU.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I was noticing while testing master that sometimes when starting OpenSim up that it is refusing to load scripts for

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> or all regions at start up. Once every thing is loaded up and the console is ready, running the 'login status' command
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> it shows that some regions are enabled login, and some aren't. In order to login the 'login enable' command must be ran
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> first. Once logged in it seems that no script will run on the regions that have not had their scripts loaded at start
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> up, including attachments, or newly rezzed objects. Had a closer look at the console out put and was noticing that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> there
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> are a lot of warnings dealing with objects I have rezzed in world that are mesh similar to below:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> chair/c861affd-17b4-4b3c-9535-f1986ab394a9
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I found that if I tracked these objects down and removed them from the region and then restarted OpenSim, there's a bit
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> better chance for scripts to be loaded properly. If I put the objects back out again and restart OpenSim then it starts
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to randomly not want to load scripts in random regions at start up. Setting DeleteScriptsOnStartup = true in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> OpenSim.ini
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> or deleteing the ScriptEngines folder prior to start up also seems to give better success at having scripts load
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> properly. It might be just my imagination and coincidence that it is working in this way but it is my observation.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Noticed that the console seems to hang for a bit (a couple seconds) before outputting warnings on these objects with
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> high CPU use. I'm just speculating on this since I'm not entirely knowledgeable on how things work but... could there
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> possibly be some kind of race condition somewhere preventing scripts from loading properly in this case?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> A couple of my regions have 0 scripts on them; not sure if it matters or not.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I normally run OpenSim with these script related settings:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> AppDomainLoading = false
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> DeleteScriptsOnStartup = false
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> EventLimit = 500
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ScriptDelayFactor = 0.0
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> AllowScriptCrossing = true
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> TrustBinaries = true
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Is anyone else seeing this?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks!
