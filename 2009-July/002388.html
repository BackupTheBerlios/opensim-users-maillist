<PRE>Considering opensim as one kind of &quot;apache for virtual worlds&quot; (a generic
virtual world server) the solution is a &quot;nanny module&quot;.

As with the currency stuff, the parental control, or any censorship thing
anyone could need, at least for me, is far from the objectives of opensim
and, overall, it could be a stupid way to make the main developers lose time
implementing this kind of stuff.

I think opensim is flexible enough (and more in the future) for allowing to
customize or even program the modules anyone could need. The only problem is
that it will require knowledge or money.

Greetings


PS - I have a teen daughter that uses internet intensively, and I know the
(possible) perills.
PS2 - Due to my principles I won't approve and/or participate in any way on
a project involving censorship, even dressed up with &quot;good&quot; intentions like
child protection.
PS3 - Mark, I'm not attacking you. As a father, sometimes I have the
temptation to watch what my daughter is doing, or limiting her movements for
protecting her agains the bad guys... But (maybe I'm wrong or not) I
consider freedom is more important than safety against possible perill.

&quot;*They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary
safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety&quot;*

&gt;<i> I apologize if this looked either naive or like trollbait. It is
</I>&gt;<i> intended seriously. I do not suggest that the developers have a
</I>&gt;<i> responsibility to deal with this. Rather I address this community
</I>&gt;<i> because of the extended expertise of its members. Perhaps I should
</I>&gt;<i> have noted that when individuals enter a chatroom on the Web, they
</I>&gt;<i> know it IS a chatroom. Because an OpenSim is somewhat equivalent to
</I>&gt;<i> an open chatroom, without being labeled, or even understood as such.
</I>&gt;<i> This issue concerns me and I am simply trying to see if there are
</I>&gt;<i> smart ways to address it.
