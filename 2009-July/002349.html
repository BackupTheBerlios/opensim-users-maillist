Verse did this with Gimp, quite promising. Typically the problem with 
adding networking to an application that was not written with it in mind 
is that things you are interested in, like when a part of an image 
changes, are not exposed from the application core. The Verse guys even 
forked gimp first to be able to do it. Later the plugin we used was for 
stock gimp, not fork, and it had to periodically scan the image and 
compare whether something in it had changed .. worked ok. Verse is quite 
clever in how it can transfer parts of textures as tiles for live 
updates (like it can move individual vertices of a mesh etc).

But also just being able to directly download/upload a whole image from 
your image app over e.g. libomv would be useful, and perhaps simple to 
do, so a good idea indeed.
