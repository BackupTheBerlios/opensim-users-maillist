<PRE>Hey there

In an effort to make OpenSimulator slightly easier to set up for the
first time with new users.

For new users of OpenSimulator, it's a big hurdle to have to rename
two files and un-comment the architecture that they want in
OpenSim.ini.   Many new users simply want to double click on
OpenSim.exe and be done.

So, to make life a little bit easier for them, I wrote a small console
application to do that first step for you defaulting to
localhost/Standalone mode.   After this program completes, you still
have to configure your first region's IP addresses, ports and things
like normal when OpenSim.exe starts up for the first time..   This
just covers the very first step.

You can get the program here:
 <A HREF="http://teravus.wmcv.com/googletester/OpenSimQuickConfigureStandalone.zip">http://teravus.wmcv.com/googletester/OpenSimQuickConfigureStandalone.zip</A>

To use the program, download OpenSimulator and place the program that
is inside the zip file in your opensim folder (It works in both the
opensim and opensim/bin folders..  so take your pick).

When you run it, it'll ask if you want to continue, check for all of
the files it needs and then make the changes.    If you already have
OpenSim.ini or StandaloneCommon.ini it asks you if you'd like to
overwrite them.

You can then Compile OpenSimulator if you hadn't done that first and
run OpenSim.exe

This is the most basic configuration change that's required to get
OpenSimulator starting up the first time.  It's only Standalone mode
and Localhost mode.  If you'd like to do anything more advanced like
hypergrid or megaregions..  or grid-mode, you'll still need to get a
good understanding of the configuration files to do so.   As usual,
the OpenSimulator developers highly recommend that you read the
configuration files and see what you're getting yourself into with the
default configuration set.

The source code for the application is extremely simple.    I posted
it to pastebin here: <A HREF="http://pastebin.com/AGktahBj">http://pastebin.com/AGktahBj</A>

Hopefully this helps people get over that first hurdle.


Regards

Teravus
