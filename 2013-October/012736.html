<PRE>Hello all,

I'm running 0.7.6 at commit 8996ac1 and am noticing a few issues that 
show up after several TP attempts. Whenever I teleport around several 
times between regions there some random side effects that sometimes 
trigger after the teleport is complete. The side effects that happen 
after the teleport issue is triggered seem non related to each other so 
the best I can do is put what I see happening in a short list; one or 
more of these side effects may show up:

* Scripts in some or all attachments get completely reset upon TP completion

* Scripts in attachments freeze and are unresponsive and then some or 
all of them get completely reset upon relog

* Teleports do not complete or take a very long time to complete

* After TP completion surrounding regions disappear and it is impossible 
to access them until relog (Sometimes takes a couple relogs for the 
region(s) to come back into view).

* If doing a region cross (as opposed to direct teleport) all (or the 
majority of) attachments disappear and the avatar drifts  or walks 
endlessly into the void requiring a relog (This one is harder to 
trigger; it requires rapidly crossing region borders. It's easier to see 
this issue if you have 4 regions connected together in a square grid 
fashion, go to the center of the 4 regions, and fly around its center in 
a circle, rapidly crossing the borders until the issue is triggered. The 
presence of attachments (scripted or non-scripted) do not seem to 
matter; was able to trigger it in this fashion either way)

These issues seem to come up most often when using the map or tp lure to 
teleport around to various regions; especially when traveling to other 
regions that are not adjacent to one another (i.e. teleporting to 
regions that are say 2 or 3 (or more) spaces apart from each other). 
It's very inconsistent as to when it is triggered but I've been able to 
successfully get one or more of the side effects to come about after a 
couple minutes of teleporting about (within approximately 5 - 10 teleports).

The presence of sleeps used with a timer event with in attachments seem 
to exacerbate it and make it show up a bit more often but it doesn't 
necessarily seem to be a key point in triggering the issue. Changed 
event firing on CHANGED_REGION also seem to make it show up a bit more 
often. Although both of these may just be my imagination =) but it seems 
to work out that way more often than not.

The script freezes and/or state reset issues seem to be what I see most 
often after the TP issue is triggered.

These are the only relevant messages I could find in my log when the 
issue is triggered:

15:55:32,341 WARN  - 
OpenSim.Region.CoreModules.Framework.EntityTransfer.EntityTransferModule 
[ENTITY TRANSFER MODULE]: Region Test Region 3 did not accept Test User 
3557bf78-5e34-4e6c-b37c-2a5a8527e3e2: Failed to verify user presence in 
the grid for Test User, access denied to region Test Region 3.

and

16:55:32 - [SCENE PRESENCE]: Did not find presence with id 
3557bf78-5e34-4e6c-b37c-2a5a8527e3e2 in Region 6 before timeout
16:55:32 - [ENTITY TRANSFER MODULE]: UpdateAgent failed on teleport of 
Test User to Region 6 Keeping avatar in Test Region 2

I am testing with script strategy set to abort. I have tried to test 
with co-op but I keep getting a rash of could not start script errors 
for scripted attachments advising me to either delete the scripts in 
ScriptEngines or set DeleteScriptsOnStartup to true, both of which I 
have tried several times and restarted OpenSim but the error messages 
keep persisting. Setting AppDomainLoading to true or false does not seem 
to make a difference either. So basically I am unable to test with 
script strategy set to co-op.

Apologies if this seems broken up or scatter-brained but since this 
issue results in multiple random side effects it's a bit hard for me to 
put it all into a concise easy to read and follow explanation.

Is any one else experiencing this?

Thanks!
