<PRE>Sound a bit like the problem i have read on this SL blog
<A HREF="http://modemworld.wordpress.com/2013/10/26/sl-projects-update-week-43-2-server-and-viewer-notes/">http://modemworld.wordpress.com/2013/10/26/sl-projects-update-week-43-2-server-and-viewer-notes/</A>
But it can be something else to offocrse.

Server Deployment

With just the one deployment to the Main channel in week 43, the entire 
grid is currently running on the same server release.

Commenting on the released package at the Server Beta group meeting on 
Thursday 24th October, Maestro and Simon Linden provided further 
information on the performance issue fix which is aimed at the 
experimental interest list viewer (which has yet to formally appear, but 
can be self-compiled by those with access to the code repository).

&quot;The bug was about avatars not loading for ~70 seconds when you visit an 
area with ten or so avatars nearby, Maestro explained. &quot;And by 'not 
loading',  you wouldn't even see name tags.&quot;

&quot;I think the problem was when those viewers used new methods to download 
or check the cache state of some data ... it would over-load the network 
and thus the avatar updates were really slow,&quot; Simon added, before 
continuing, &quot;Since the current viewer doesn't do that, they don't have 
the bug. Clubs and large crowds are always a problem because when you 
arrive you just get a ton of data to fetch and load.&quot;

Week 44 should see what Maestro described as a &quot;minor maintenance 
release&quot; for the server appearing next week, which includes &quot;a few 
miscellaneous crash fixes&quot;. At the time of writing it is not clear if 
this will be the only RC deployment or whether anything else might also 
pop-up when the deployment thread is published.
