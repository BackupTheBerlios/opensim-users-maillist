</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>First thing I would do before attempting to fix the issue is make a
</I>&gt;<i>backup of your database; Once you've done that; check your environment
</I>&gt;<i>variables in System Properties &gt; Advanced Tab &gt; Environment Variables
</I>&gt;<i>and look under System Variables for Path, edit it and and see if
</I>&gt;<i>possibly the path to /mysql install path here/bin hasn't been removed
</I>&gt;<i>due to the upgrade. If it's not there then try putting that back in and
</I>&gt;<i>reboot your computer. If worse comes to worse I suppose you could
</I>&gt;<i>reinstall MySQL and then restore from your database backup if necessary
</I>&gt;<i>(not sure if it would get overwritten or not from a reinstall).
</I>

Thanks Chris... the path environment variable was okay and the usual 
mysql and mysqld commands were being found.  It was the &quot;MySQL&quot; 
service registration that had in it a faulty path to the myslyd 
executable with the /bin stripped out, and indeed the parameter to 
the --default-path removed!   Since the services area in the Task 
Manager does not let you alter the executable I had to resort to 
changing the registry.  But a simple change there to make it the same 
as all my other MySQL 5.6 entries and it all worked again 
fine.  Really peculiar upgrade issue!
