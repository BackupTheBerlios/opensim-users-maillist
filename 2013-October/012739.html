<PRE>I confirm on Linux 64 and windows 7 -64 Grid with (Robust, MySQL in the
same server as regions).

And let me add to your list:

*prims attached lost (in inventory are as worn but you can not see it
really worn and you can not undress from inventory  (as example hair).
This is totally aleatory, sometimes occurs but not always.   I can not
reproduce it. For this I have not reported in mantis.

&gt;<i> Hello all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm running 0.7.6 at commit 8996ac1 and am noticing a few issues that show
</I>&gt;<i> up after several TP attempts. Whenever I teleport around several times
</I>&gt;<i> between regions there some random side effects that sometimes trigger after
</I>&gt;<i> the teleport is complete. The side effects that happen after the teleport
</I>&gt;<i> issue is triggered seem non related to each other so the best I can do is
</I>&gt;<i> put what I see happening in a short list; one or more of these side effects
</I>&gt;<i> may show up:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Scripts in some or all attachments get completely reset upon TP
</I>&gt;<i> completion
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Scripts in attachments freeze and are unresponsive and then some or all
</I>&gt;<i> of them get completely reset upon relog
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Teleports do not complete or take a very long time to complete
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * After TP completion surrounding regions disappear and it is impossible
</I>&gt;<i> to access them until relog (Sometimes takes a couple relogs for the
</I>&gt;<i> region(s) to come back into view).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * If doing a region cross (as opposed to direct teleport) all (or the
</I>&gt;<i> majority of) attachments disappear and the avatar drifts  or walks
</I>&gt;<i> endlessly into the void requiring a relog (This one is harder to trigger;
</I>&gt;<i> it requires rapidly crossing region borders. It's easier to see this issue
</I>&gt;<i> if you have 4 regions connected together in a square grid fashion, go to
</I>&gt;<i> the center of the 4 regions, and fly around its center in a circle, rapidly
</I>&gt;<i> crossing the borders until the issue is triggered. The presence of
</I>&gt;<i> attachments (scripted or non-scripted) do not seem to matter; was able to
</I>&gt;<i> trigger it in this fashion either way)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> These issues seem to come up most often when using the map or tp lure to
</I>&gt;<i> teleport around to various regions; especially when traveling to other
</I>&gt;<i> regions that are not adjacent to one another (i.e. teleporting to regions
</I>&gt;<i> that are say 2 or 3 (or more) spaces apart from each other). It's very
</I>&gt;<i> inconsistent as to when it is triggered but I've been able to successfully
</I>&gt;<i> get one or more of the side effects to come about after a couple minutes of
</I>&gt;<i> teleporting about (within approximately 5 - 10 teleports).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The presence of sleeps used with a timer event with in attachments seem to
</I>&gt;<i> exacerbate it and make it show up a bit more often but it doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> necessarily seem to be a key point in triggering the issue. Changed event
</I>&gt;<i> firing on CHANGED_REGION also seem to make it show up a bit more often.
</I>&gt;<i> Although both of these may just be my imagination =) but it seems to work
</I>&gt;<i> out that way more often than not.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The script freezes and/or state reset issues seem to be what I see most
</I>&gt;<i> often after the TP issue is triggered.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> These are the only relevant messages I could find in my log when the issue
</I>&gt;<i> is triggered:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 15:55:32,341 WARN  - OpenSim.Region.CoreModules.**
</I>&gt;<i> Framework.EntityTransfer.**EntityTransferModule [ENTITY TRANSFER MODULE]:
</I>&gt;<i> Region Test Region 3 did not accept Test User 3557bf78-5e34-4e6c-b37c-**2a5a8527e3e2:
</I>&gt;<i> Failed to verify user presence in the grid for Test User, access denied to
</I>&gt;<i> region Test Region 3.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 16:55:32 - [SCENE PRESENCE]: Did not find presence with id
</I>&gt;<i> 3557bf78-5e34-4e6c-b37c-**2a5a8527e3e2 in Region 6 before timeout
</I>&gt;<i> 16:55:32 - [ENTITY TRANSFER MODULE]: UpdateAgent failed on teleport of
</I>&gt;<i> Test User to Region 6 Keeping avatar in Test Region 2
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am testing with script strategy set to abort. I have tried to test with
</I>&gt;<i> co-op but I keep getting a rash of could not start script errors for
</I>&gt;<i> scripted attachments advising me to either delete the scripts in
</I>&gt;<i> ScriptEngines or set DeleteScriptsOnStartup to true, both of which I have
</I>&gt;<i> tried several times and restarted OpenSim but the error messages keep
</I>&gt;<i> persisting. Setting AppDomainLoading to true or false does not seem to make
</I>&gt;<i> a difference either. So basically I am unable to test with script strategy
</I>&gt;<i> set to co-op.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Apologies if this seems broken up or scatter-brained but since this issue
</I>&gt;<i> results in multiple random side effects it's a bit hard for me to put it
</I>&gt;<i> all into a concise easy to read and follow explanation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is any one else experiencing this?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks!
