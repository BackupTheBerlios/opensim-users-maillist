<PRE>So, I think that there's an argument that this is effectively spam - but I'm going to go ahead and use up some of my 
yearly spam allocation anyway since this might be of interest to people on these lists.

My current company (the Fashion Research Institute) and IBM (my previous company) today announced that we're developing 
a virtual world Product Lifecycle Management solution using OpenSimulator.  Essentially, this will allow product and 
fashion designers to do their work in an OpenSimulator hosted environment, with the kind of workflow and oversight 
management that benefits enterprises.  More details are in the press release picked up by the Wall Street Journal's 
Market Watch site at

<A HREF="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/ibm-signs-services-agreement-fashion/story.aspx?guid={6626C1FE-26A8-423B-9DA3-CD70B349932D">http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/ibm-signs-services-agreement-fashion/story.aspx?guid={6626C1FE-26A8-423B-9DA3-CD70B349932D</A>}&amp;dist=hppr

This is an example of using OpenSimulator as part of a standalone software solution.  I think that it shows that there 
is a lot of potential for the software out there - more than for purely general purpose grid hosting.
