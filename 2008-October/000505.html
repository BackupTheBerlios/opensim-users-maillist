<PRE>Hi Folks. I hope you guys can help with this ...

I have a 6 sim standalone region on a LAN pc at home. I connect
to it via ethernet through an ADSL modem/switch, which has a fairly
fast ADSL connection (~7mb) to the net. I'm in the UK.

Both the client and Opensim PC are running Windows XP Pro
with plenty of disk space and processing power.

I have no problems connecting to or viewing my region, either
through direct LAN connection or through the net.

However, when my friend in Australia connects to the region,
she has recently been seeing the following ....

<A HREF="http://www.mediacave.co.uk/opensim/Opensim_prob.jpg">http://www.mediacave.co.uk/opensim/Opensim_prob.jpg</A>
<A HREF="http://www.mediacave.co.uk/opensim/Opensim_prob1.jpg">http://www.mediacave.co.uk/opensim/Opensim_prob1.jpg</A>
<A HREF="http://www.mediacave.co.uk/opensim/Opensim_prob2.jpg">http://www.mediacave.co.uk/opensim/Opensim_prob2.jpg</A>
(no real square holes in the actual terrain).

This only seems to have been happening since after svn 6679
- around October 5th (I normally do a Trunk update weekly). 
Prior to the above, everything looked perfect.

It is not consistent, except there is always some (though usually
lots) of terrain blocks 'missing'. Physics is ok, so this is purely 'visible'.

She has tried two good spec PC's (on the same connection), both with
Windows XP, but with different (good) graphics cards. SL runs with no
problems for her.

I have tried various releases (svn) and also the latest OSGRID binary
5.11/7000, but she's still getting the same results to varying degrees.

Any help would be appreciated.

Cheers,
Dave
