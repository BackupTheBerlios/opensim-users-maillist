Some Dutch folks tested Mumble for voice quality early this year, they
had quite hard requirements 'cause were evaluating options for language
education (and considering realXtend), and AFAIK found it adequate.
Dunno if they have actually started using it since or what happened.

For my ears Skype has still sounded still better, but Mumble pretty good
too .. just when have used it in meetings etc., haven't done proper
evaluations myself.
