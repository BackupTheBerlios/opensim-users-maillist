<PRE>Prevent theft?  I don't think that's actually possible.  But something to help bring instances of such to the actual owner's attention... I think that's doable.

A cooperative protocol between the client, the asset server, and some logging server system would be useful -- again, not to prevent theft, but just to notify of potential misuse.

On asset upload, client could optionally add knowledge of any ownership claims it's aware of.
On asset download, client could optionally receive knowledge of any ownership claims the asset server is aware of.
On asset download, client would calculate hash of asset and store { content hash, the asset URL, ownership claims it receives from the asset server } tuple.
On hash collision, if the ownership information is not identical, all ownership claimants would be notified of the ownership claim collision, and where the collision occurred.
Precompiled binaries of OpenSim asset server, and unmodified sources used to build them, could also have the notification code built in.

I wonder... should there should be a concept of &quot;open source - open ethics&quot; or something?  If you set the distributed binaries up to perform that kind of checking by default, and set the .example configs to opt the server in by default, then... how many people would disable that code?  Particularly since it would be designed to help protect the rights of content creators.

I am of the belief that DRM shouldn't be a matter of preventing the usage of something, it should be a matter of notifying a rights claimant of potential misuse, so that the grievance would be more appropriately aired with the potential to be put before a court.  Our job as developers should be enabling the lawyers to do their jobs, not trying to put the lawyers out of business.

Ah well.  Just a dream.  I know that Diva and the rest of the team are too busy to implement it, and I've been tainted by looking at the Linden C++ source, so I can't contribute anything.
