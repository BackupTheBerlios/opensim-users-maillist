</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Folks,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not to add to the religious fervor....    but there's a couple things
</I>&gt;<i> that are just NOT right about letting the mis-information slide.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's very popular for proponents of each side to wave magic metrics
</I>&gt;<i> and declare victory in a race that could have just begun.     People
</I>&gt;<i> don't come to this list to ask your opinion about Linux vs.Windows  IN
</I>&gt;<i> GENERAL, they want to know what easiest with OpenSim.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Its extremely disappointing to me to see that discussion drown out by
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;know-it-alls&quot; spewing their answers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim uses .NET as a platform,  as such, If you intend to RUN
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim, you can do it either as a native .NET application under
</I>&gt;<i> windows, or on non-windows OS using the open-source MONO environment.  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Among the advantages of using Windows servers:
</I>&gt;<i>     Historically, it has provided better operating performance for
</I>&gt;<i> regions.
</I>&gt;<i>     Most of the developers seem to be prefer the Microsoft toolchain.
</I>&gt;<i>     There are no threats of c## &quot;subterfuge&quot; by MS ( the risk of these
</I>&gt;<i> seems very small)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Among the advantages of Mono OS independence:
</I>&gt;<i>     Wider range of server platforms ( via  OS and hardware independence )
</I>&gt;<i>     Like all smaller free software efforts, the best way to support it
</I>&gt;<i> is to USE it and make it better
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you select MONO based server platforms, it will pay for you to do
</I>&gt;<i> your homework on your selection.  Contrary to prior posts, many of the
</I>&gt;<i> popular Linux releases  (UBUNTU in particular) are notorious for NOT
</I>&gt;<i> supporting the latest release of MONO.   That is not to say that you
</I>&gt;<i> cannot build the latest version of MONO, but the &quot;regular&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> repositories of supported software won't have it.   All religious
</I>&gt;<i> preferences aside,  If you want to pick a linux distro with the latest
</I>&gt;<i> and greatest MONO has to provide  I would recommend you go to the
</I>&gt;<i> Novell  SuSe distribution. 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are always arguments on both sides of the questions that touch
</I>&gt;<i> the religion wars off.  For me, in this project, the most telling sign
</I>&gt;<i> that Windows is the &quot;preference&quot; of the core developers  is that there
</I>&gt;<i> is still little or no support for the MONOdevelope IDE.  Make and
</I>&gt;<i> build on Linux from source still depends on the old-school command
</I>&gt;<i> line tools.  Lots of people are comfortable enough with their Linux
</I>&gt;<i> skills to cope with that requirement.. 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Personally,  I'm one of the &quot;irrational&quot; believers that we vote
</I>&gt;<i> loudest with our actions, so I pay to host linux machines for our
</I>&gt;<i> internal OpenSim development machines, and generally make it known I
</I>&gt;<i> prefer NOT to pay Microsoft whenever that option presents itself.  
</I>&gt;<i> Your Satisfaction is not guaranteed by adopting that plan  :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> D.

Prebuild was getting a little dated for monodevelop and our build system
didn't produce proper solution files for monodevelop. Therfore
monodevelop got a bad rap as being a hack, half implemented, etc. . So,
I reworked our build system a little bit, adding some patches upstream
to Prebuild.exe to provide proper solutions to our build system to
support both monodevelop and xbuild.

Now monodevelop may be used as a fully working IDE for OpenSim, debugger
included. Also, xbuild for the command line works. And, Native git
support is slated for Monodevelop 2.6. I have never used the free VS,
but this might be a viable alternative for Windows users as well.

Here are some notes about the updates and setting your addon-module
prebuild.xml files to work with the new system. These is also a small
python script to help with the migration. The link is here:
<A HREF="http://bluewallvirtual.com/node/9">http://bluewallvirtual.com/node/9</A> . (Teravus got the search working on
opensimulator.org \o/ , I will try to update the site there with this
information when time allows.

It is good that we are striving for platform neutrality. This allows a
person to use whatever tools are suited best for their abilities and taste.

Thanks!
BlueWall
