<PRE>I was just clarifying my earlier statements.

1.       Mono is backed by Microsoft - That is the basic problem.  They have
a fiduciary responsibility to stockholders that is in opposition to
providing a seamless migration off of their product.
2.       .Net is open source -
<A HREF="http://blogs.computerworlduk.com/open-enterprise/2010/07/richard-stallman-on-net-mono-and-dotgnu">http://blogs.computerworlduk.com/open-enterprise/2010/07/richard-stallman-on-net-mono-and-dotgnu</A>
/index.htm  &quot; 'open specification promise' is not something we can rely on&quot;
*Eben Moglen*, Professor of Law, Columbia Law School
I would suggest that a Columbia Law School Professor's opinion has a bit
more weight  than a layman's.
3. no need for sarcasm, your link is quite believable,  as it says.
&quot;commercially reasonable terms and conditions&quot; which are very specifically
not free software.
4. is simply assertions
5. yes, you are correct. OpenSim has gone far down a road that may well be a
dead end.
6. &quot;better&quot; is a fuzzy term.  Is a closed source OS better for an
application builder? depends on the metric.
 Is one OS better than another? that quickly becomes &quot;specmanship&quot; with each
side asserting that a given specification is critical. I'd point to OS on
the list of fastest super computers, and you'd point to installed desktops
(I am a fan of Microsoft's office suite)


none of this is relevant to my earlier statement -
Free Software is Computer *Science* - open experiments with all the evidence
available to all researchers.
The opposite is the guild system where knowledge is hoarded and no one
outside the guild is allowed to know how things are done. It is unnatural
and requires the use of force (legal penalties) to impose. It slows down the
advancement of knowledge.
in conclusion;
if Opensim is to be used for education, then would a closed or open OS be
more appropriate?

(appropriate != better)

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4.       Most/all improvements to .Net the last few years has been
</I>&gt;<i> additions. OpenSim has no problem waiting 6-12 months for Mono to catch up
</I>&gt;<i> before using the additions, because none of these new features are critical.
</I>&gt;<i> So yes, words can be used to argument on this point &#8211; but the reality is
</I>&gt;<i> that it doesn&#8217;t matter if Mono is playing catch-up. If anything the
</I>&gt;<i> developers have time to learn the new technology before implementing them
</I>&gt;<i> resulting in increased code quality in OpenSim.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And then we come to #5:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Unless someone are willing to rewrite OpenSim in another language which
</I>&gt;<i> suits their taste better I think this conversation thread may have a
</I>&gt;<i> relatively high probability of being of that popular culture metaphorical
</I>&gt;<i> dead end that we sometimes hear about.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now for OS: Now I won&#8217;t detail the kernels of Win vs Lin, but I can point
</I>&gt;<i> out that anyone who says that either is better is basically an ignorant fool

</I>&gt;<i> I would point out that I did give a helpful link to the the original
</I>&gt;<i> question (Drupal does run on Windows, my link was to their page)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My use of the word &quot;real&quot; is because Free Software is Computer *Science* -
</I>&gt;<i> open experiments with all the evidence available to all researchers.

</I>&gt;<i> advancement of knowledge.
</I>&gt;<i> You don't need source code to break an operating system - Microsoft has
</I>&gt;<i> demonstrated that beyond debate.
</I>&gt;<i> You do need source code to fix it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> looking at James comment
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Pick your application
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Pick the language that best implements it
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Pick the best operating system that supports it (natively is to be
</I>&gt;<i> preferred)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4. pick the hardware that runs that operating system
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim is being tied to Windows due to the use of .net (I agree with James
</I>&gt;<i> parenthetical statement)
</I>&gt;<i> Mono is open, but it is a potential landmine of patent liability, which is
</I>&gt;<i> why it has been dropped from Fedora/Red Hat.
</I>&gt;<i> That loss of userbase/mindshare impacts on the development of Mono.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm pleased to hear that the garbage collection is being improved, but by
</I>&gt;<i> design, Mono is locked into playing catch up against .net
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a result, the roadmap of a critical component belongs to a company that
</I>&gt;<i> has their own agenda, and it may not support your project
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Having an open project dependent on a closed OS introduces a point of
</I>&gt;<i> failure, outside of the developers control.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Suggesting nefarious scheming on the part of Microsoft is not unreasonable,
</I>&gt;<i> given the company's history -  from the days of the DR-DOS lawsuit to the
</I>&gt;<i> theft of code from Plurk and the whole fuss over stolen XML code in their
</I>&gt;<i> office suite back at the begining of this year. If Mono is an intentional
</I>&gt;<i> landmine this project would be among the casualties, not even noticed in the
</I>&gt;<i> larger scheme of things.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If you have to install a new system for a specific task you'll have to

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; installation and there are other jobs which will lead to a windows
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; installation.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Not to forget that there are typical os/x tasks which will lead to an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; xserve installation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; or something similar (sometimes hardware dependant).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Back to OpenSim: You have the choice. I guess we don't have a 'typical'
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; OpenSim
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; installation. Linux or Windows. Your own decision. Both are as good as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the other.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Nothing bad about windows - but usually (if you rent a server) a few
</I>&gt;<i> bucks
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; more expensive than a linux box (due to license cost). That's all.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But that's not a question of quality. If you'd use Red Hat Linux you had
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pay license fees, too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In Red Hat's case, as I used to work there, you're paying for the
</I>&gt;<i> service per license but never for the software. Bob Young hired me back
</I>&gt;<i> when, mostly to be the Goat amongst his 20 somethings Thoroughbreds, not
</I>&gt;<i> because I was a coder whizbang propeller head. If you don't need the
</I>&gt;<i> service, then CentOS can be installed for free. Again, that's bare
</I>&gt;<i> knucks, but makes for one tough server.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Far more important is bandwidth of internet connection, latency,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; size of ram, disk speed, number of cpu cores.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I most certainly concur with that. I'd give anything to tap the Sprint
</I>&gt;<i> fiber optic cable that runs through our front yard, it's a major route
</I>&gt;<i> on the net's backbone. When I asked how much to connect, I got an
</I>&gt;<i> offhand &quot;several grand a month ...or so&quot;. It goes from DC to Blackstone
