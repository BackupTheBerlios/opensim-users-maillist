<PRE>Hello there,

Teravus(Dan Olivares) here, one of the developers of OpenSimulator.   I just
want to take this opportunity to welcome all of the new subscribers from the
education community.

If you have any questions about OpenSimulator or just want to chat with the
community about it, feel free to send a message here.   Not every question
will have an answer here, however, most will.   The OpenSimulator wiki is
chock full of useful and sometimes outdated information BUT the wiki search
is pretty useless.   If you're going to search the wiki, for now, I'd
suggest doing a google search.

Remember, once you get your opensimulator distribution downloaded and
extracted, the first step is copying the ./bin/OpenSim.ini.example to
OpenSim.ini.   Next go to the bottom of OpenSim.ini text file and pick your
architecture type.  You do this by removing the semi-colon before the line
with your desired architecture.     After that, go the ./bin/config-include
folder and copy the appropriate *common.ini.example to *common.ini.    For
the standalone architecture that would be 'StandaloneCommon.ini.example'.

After that you should be able to run OpenSim.exe (on linux or 32 bit
Windows) or OpenSim.32BitLaunch.exe (for 64 bit windows) and follow the on
screen prompts to get your first simulator up and running.

After you log in a few times, you will definitely want to read the entire
OpenSim.ini file.   Included in the file is mostly complete documentation on
the configuration options that you could choose.    You can also check out
OpenSimDefaults.ini for more advanced configuration options.

There's one other list that you might be interested in if you intend to do
significant development on OpenSimulator and that's [opensim-dev]
(<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev">https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-dev</A> )

Our bug tracker is: <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/mantis/">http://opensimulator.org/mantis/</A>
We have an IRC channel on freenode: #opensim

Once again, I welcome you to the list and hope OpenSimulator is something
that you can benefit.   It's been a labor of love for quite some time now
and with time, luck, feedback and additional development, we hope that it,
or some server application based on it, will become the future 'Apache of
Virtual Worlds'.

Take care and good luck!

Teravus
