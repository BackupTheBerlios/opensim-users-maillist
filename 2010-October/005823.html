You hit the nail on the head, thank you. That is the point to control
the &quot;experience&quot;. As we're using this as a prison rehab tool, and the
main purpose is to direct the &quot;client&quot; towards instructional videos,
sending the &quot;client&quot; to a video in a browser would take load off of the
server? I would think so. Do you know where I can find a how-to, written
simply, to teach me how to do this? I will be forever in your debt.  Ric
