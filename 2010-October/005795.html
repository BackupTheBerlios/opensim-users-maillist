<PRE>There is another way to get rid of such objects. At least with the 0.7.x series of OpenSim, that &quot;red spew&quot; should list the UUIDs of the problematic scripts and/or objects. Knowing the UUID, you can issue a &quot;kill uuid &lt;uuid&gt;&quot; command on the simulator console.

When you put such a command into a file named &quot;startup_commands.txt&quot; in the bin directory, then you can even take care of objects that for one reason or another disrupt the start process of a simulator and prevent you from getting to the console prompt.
