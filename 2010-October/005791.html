<PRE>       Agree with everything mentioned below (including the Bravissimo!). One important consideration that needs to be added is that the platform you decide to use should be very heavily influenced by the type of sim/sims you want to host on your grid. We have just ported over a relatively complex, heavily scripted sim from SL to OpenSim which I'm hosting on Ubuntu Server 10.04 (Mono 2.4.4) running OpenSim 0.7.0.2 and let me tell you, mono is really struggling. I am also testing with mono 2.6.7 and it is performing somewhat better with tweaks, but it shows that mono can be a real weak link in the chain (assuming you have adequate hardware, which I definitely have:)). I am going to test on Windows to see if .NET handles the load better, but the point is that depending on your requirements, one or the other may not be suitable. Both have their benefits and limitations depending on different applications/implementations- you should always keep an open mind on all reasonable/realistic possibilities. Don't just be swayed by opinions on what OS to use- go with what works for you. BTW, I'm not into the whole &quot;religion wars&quot; thing- I am first and foremost a pragmatist and proud of it! OpenSim rocks and to all the core devs: you are all awesome- love your work!
       
       That's my 2 cents for today :)

Bravissimo!

&gt;<i> Folks,

</I>&gt;<i> Not to add to the religious fervor....    but there's a couple things that
</I>&gt;<i> are just NOT right about letting the mis-information slide.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's very popular for proponents of each side to wave magic metrics and
</I>&gt;<i> declare victory in a race that could have just begun.     People don't come
</I>&gt;<i> to this list to ask your opinion about Linux vs.Windows  IN GENERAL, they
</I>&gt;<i> want to know what easiest with OpenSim.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Its extremely disappointing to me to see that discussion drown out by the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;know-it-alls&quot; spewing their answers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim uses .NET as a platform,  as such, If you intend to RUN OpenSim,
</I>&gt;<i> you can do it either as a native .NET application under windows, or on
</I>&gt;<i> non-windows OS using the open-source MONO environment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Among the advantages of using Windows servers:
</I>&gt;<i>     Historically, it has provided better operating performance for regions.
</I>&gt;<i>     Most of the developers seem to be prefer the Microsoft toolchain.
</I>&gt;<i>     There are no threats of c## &quot;subterfuge&quot; by MS ( the risk of these
</I>&gt;<i> seems very small)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Among the advantages of Mono OS independence:
</I>&gt;<i>     Wider range of server platforms ( via  OS and hardware independence )
</I>&gt;<i>     Like all smaller free software efforts, the best way to support it is
</I>&gt;<i> to USE it and make it better
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you select MONO based server platforms, it will pay for you to do your
</I>&gt;<i> homework on your selection.  Contrary to prior posts, many of the popular
</I>&gt;<i> Linux releases  (UBUNTU in particular) are notorious for NOT supporting the
</I>&gt;<i> latest release of MONO.   That is not to say that you cannot build the
</I>&gt;<i> latest version of MONO, but the &quot;regular&quot; repositories of supported software
</I>&gt;<i> won't have it.   All religious preferences aside,  If you want to pick a
</I>&gt;<i> linux distro with the latest and greatest MONO has to provide  I would
</I>&gt;<i> recommend you go to the Novell  SuSe distribution.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are always arguments on both sides of the questions that touch the
</I>&gt;<i> religion wars off.  For me, in this project, the most telling sign that
</I>&gt;<i> Windows is the &quot;preference&quot; of the core developers  is that there is still
</I>&gt;<i> little or no support for the MONOdevelope IDE.  Make and build on Linux from
</I>&gt;<i> source still depends on the old-school command line tools.  Lots of people
</I>&gt;<i> are comfortable enough with their Linux skills to cope with that
</I>&gt;<i> requirement..
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Personally,  I'm one of the &quot;irrational&quot; believers that we vote loudest
</I>&gt;<i> with our actions, so I pay to host linux machines for our internal OpenSim
</I>&gt;<i> development machines, and generally make it known I prefer NOT to pay
</I>&gt;<i> Microsoft whenever that option presents itself.   Your Satisfaction is not
</I>&gt;<i> guaranteed by adopting that plan  :)
