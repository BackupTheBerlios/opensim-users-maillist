<PRE>There is a lot of stuff for going from the opposite direction that I found online.  There is not so much explicit for going the other way.  I was careful in my build to not use oversized prims.  I tried using Meerkat to grab the entire thing.  That worked fine on OpenSim worlds but not so good when bringing it to Second Life.  I think in part the different max link distrance and max number of prims is linkset was biting me although there was not enough information to tell.  

Does anyone know of any good tools for doing such a thing easily?  Any best practices or things known to work without too much pain?    I like building offline on my laptop and importing things to where I want them.  I am sure I am not the only one doing this.
