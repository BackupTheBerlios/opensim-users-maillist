</I>Mono is currently using about 5% of my CPU with 1 user logged in (me)
and I had forgot it's still running. Wonderland would eat up about 50%
and jump higher than that with it's client. This ain't bad! If a new
version of mono will improve opensim even more, that's great news. It
just blows my mind to be running .exe anything. 

So, I haven't optimized my kernel, as a server boxen, just running
plain-jane Ubuntu 10.4 32 bit. If I wanted to create a dedicated opensim
server, I can just dump the overhead of the desktop completely and run
it command line and burn a lean/mean kernel. So, there is plenty of room
for improvement. Have you gone this route yet?? Thanks Ric
