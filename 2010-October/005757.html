I was about to reply the very same notion you just presented. Also, when
he gets to 1,000 users on his job, the costs of licenses might get
steep. The boss might say, &quot;Let's migrate this file/print/web server to
Linux.&quot; It's good to know &quot;something&quot; of all of the OS's in these tight
times. I KNOW Windows, as a server, costs the big $$. I'm not about
making one of the richest guys in the world richer from my skinny
wallet. Oh heck no. Neither are a lot of companies. 

Heck, I still miss CP/M and line numbered basic. 

&gt;<i> OpenSim content: I am getting a Windows 7 machine from my school very
</I>&gt;<i> soon and I will test Hiro's assertion about the superiority of Windows
</I>&gt;<i> and OS at that time. Meanwhile, thanks for allaying my fears and

It's a personal choice for me. I've watched MS since the early DOS days,
didn't like the way they conducted themselves and I switched to Linux
back in the 11 disk set install days of Slackware. I missed Minefields
on Win3.1, but Linux had &quot;Hunt the Wumpus&quot;, so I was OK. Later, with
Caldera Open Linux, I could install and run 16bit Win3.1 on 32bit Linux
under Wabi. It ran like a scalded ape! Right down to the opening bars of
&quot;Tah Dah!&quot; So, it you could put a Win 7 desktop, that would run Win 7
apps on top of Linux, that would really be something. &lt;grins&gt; Ric
