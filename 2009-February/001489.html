<PRE>I tried these guys at one point, but only stayed for about a day.  The 
first problem I had was that they only offered 64 bit kernels for linux 
Ubuntu.  After a bit of puttering and ripping some hair out I was able 
to get OpenSim going on 64 bit, but it wasn't exactly stable enough to 
use.  The second biggest problem which was a total show-stopper was they 
don't allow custom partitioning, hence you cant set any amount of swap 
space.  If your opensim goes over the alloted memory amount, without the 
ability to swap it will simply seg-fault and die.  Bandwidth wise, they 
were awesome - I'll give them that much. But in the end I wound up going 
with Linode.  So far with them we're able to run our whole grid with 
little to no problems and plenty of room for swap just in case we wind 
up with a super heavy load of users.  As well, they also offer the 
ability to create a private internal network which is a super bandwidth 
saver if you're running a private grid or want to run everything off of 
once MySQL server.  For reference, our config is as follows:

mysql (handles databases for ugaim, sim servers, web cms, wiredux, and 
project management) -
    Linode 540 - average 1% cpu, ~450 megs / ram used
grid (handles UGAIM, outgoing mail from web, web interfaces (Wiredux, 
Joomla, and Overlord)) -
    Linode 360 - averages 1% cpu, ~300 megs / ram used
ellis (handles 3 Ellis Island sims, 1 light use hypergrid gateway, 2 
scrap / in development sims - 5810 prims total, roughly 150 scripts) -
    Linode 540 - average 10 to 15% cpu, ~500 megs / ram used
tenchi (handles 3 Ravenport sims - 9768 prims, 2 Tokyo (empty), 
Dreadbane - 7781 prims, and Felonhall (empty) - ~19536 prims total, 300 
scripts) -
    Linode 1080 - average 20 to 25% cpu, ~500 megs / ram used

Meanwhile price wise they're not bad at all and bandwidth wise I'm able 
to average 4 megabits (Servers located in Newark, NJ - I'm in West Palm 
Beach, FL).  A Linode 540 for $30 / month was able to run just our three 
Ellis sims quite well with a full build and mysql running locally before 
we loaded them up with scripts and a few gigs worth of boxed inventory / 
texture items then had to offload mysql to its own server and upgrade.  :)

Thanks, :)
