<PRE>We are doing really well with cari.net with OpenSim regions on OSGrid. Their support is great, prices are great and I would recommend them. All the plazas on OSGrid run on two Cari.net servers currently.

Depends on what the four regions are used for.  A couple of avs, not a
huge number of scripts or prims, absolutely.  But you're not going to
be able to run Wright Plaza on something that tiny.

I've used Tektonic before, but not for OpenSim (but I've heard others
have).  I liked the service, but prefer Linode [ <A HREF="http://linode.com">http://linode.com</A> ]
which offers something similar.  I've used both their &quot;Linode 360&quot; and
&quot;Linode 540&quot; plans with OpenSim, and it's worked great, though I used
it for something low on prims/scripts.  Currently the OSGrid region
Knifejaw Atoll and the voids W, E, SW, and S of it are hosted on a
single Linode 540 plan (similar in spec to Tektonic's &quot;Level-2&quot;
plan)... feel free to fly in a few alts and see how it performs.  You
can also watch the server performance stats while you're doing so at:

I also know someone else who's happily running OpenSim on a low-cost
VPS from <A HREF="http://www.fsckvps.com/hosting/">http://www.fsckvps.com/hosting/</A>
