<PRE>Well, the OAR doesn't have to be entire regions - it's basically a archive file (targz) containing:


-          An XML file for each object

-          All associated assets

There's no reason why the number of XML files has to match the entire region, I believe being able to seamlessly import these without a wipe probably makes some sense.

Subject: Re: [Opensim-users] What are some solutions for oar file sharing?

Ok, another thread never hurts I suppose. ;)

Agreed no wikis for content sharing ultimately.

I agree with others forge is the place.

Are we in agreement that OARs are the standard? Don't they represent entire regions?

The standard workflow, then, seems to be becoming that every grid have an OAR landing pad that gets wiped and redone for each OAR import as content is moved into other locations on that grid. Did I get that right? Someday a client side way to do the same would be nice, but Second Inventory seems to have that locked up at the moment, although I would love to reduce our dependence on it.

All,

I have noticed there are several seperate threads trying to deal with this
subject. How about we roll it under this one thread to make it easier to
follow? The problem is we have and will have a ton of oar files to share and
need a solid way to accomplish it other than clogging up a wiki server.
Mirrors? Bit torrent? What are your thoughts? Thanks!
