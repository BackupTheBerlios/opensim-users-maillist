Mic mentioned on the other thread about Cable Beach
(<A HREF="http://forge.opensimulator.org/gf/project/assetserver/">http://forge.opensimulator.org/gf/project/assetserver/</A>) but I haven't had a
chance to investigate it yet. Please take a look when you get a chance.
Seems like using oar files can be a bit bulky in the long run particularly
as Mo mentioned from a granular level. Adam has a point too, the oars
contain XML files, assets, and objects directories. There must be some
simple tool for importing and exporting.

I have heard of this and am only experimenting now with it, but doesn't that
imply some cleanup of the output from a save-oar against an entire region?
Even if that region has nothing in it but the new items you have built? and
are targetting for later sharing as OAR.

This also raises a best-practice question about the amount of content to
generally put in an OAR in any sharing site. OARs could be as granular as
one per, say, sofa, or as broad as one per city block.

Perhaps that is something that does not lend itself to convention and should
just be left up to the content provider, but it seems to me the more
granular the content contained in the OAR package the more consumable they
become overall.

I have always dreamed of something of an SL Xchange site where people could
search out such packaged (OAR) content, view a few snapshots of it, and
click a button to download it, even load it into their opensim directly.
Someday it will come one way or another. Funny, if XStreet allowed file
upload and download and PayPal payment as well as just Linden it could
almost serve that purpose right now and we could have a content 'mall' to
piggy back for even for-sale content as well.
