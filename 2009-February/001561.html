Very interesting - thanks for looking into this.

It seems that in actual builds, those we see in use in SL, for
example, most prims don't need to be non-phantom but are, and it's not
surprising to find that your exercise reduces the cost.   I've
sometimes wondered if there's a case for saying that new prims should
be phantom by default, though I'm not necessarily suggesting that as a
course of action for OpenSim.  It certainly helps avatar movement when
a cleanup like you describe is done, especially with furniture,
poseballs etc, and it's well worth the time doing that even if only
for the sake of smooth operation.

Is there any indication of a corresponding drop in CPU usage,
especially when avatars are moving around in there?
