<PRE>
There are some diagnostics commands like

 

show statistics

and

show queues

 

that could sometimes be instructional.


Also, you can monitor the regions with the Statistics module that resides on /SStats on the region http server (if my memory serve me right)

</I>&gt;<i> Subject: [Opensim-users] Help in CPU usage diagnosis, please
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've noticed the past couple of builds I've used have sometimes make
</I>&gt;<i> heavy use of the CPU even when idle. For example, today, after
</I>&gt;<i> leaving the system idle overnight, the two virtual CPUs (a single-core
</I>&gt;<i> Pentium 4) were running constantly at 96-99% each, whereas normally
</I>&gt;<i> I'd expect 35-40% and 12-15% during idle running, most of that
</I>&gt;<i> non-Opensim overhead.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When this happens, sometimes - but not always - a reload of the server
</I>&gt;<i> fixes it. I'm only running a single OpenSim.exe, and using OSGrid's
</I>&gt;<i> UGAIM.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is noticeable in-world as lag, and I'd like to find out what's
</I>&gt;<i> causing it, but I don't know how to narrow it down, other than by
</I>&gt;<i> eliminating various regions and also disabling services such as
</I>&gt;<i> scripting and prim physics. With five regions, and more on the way,
</I>&gt;<i> it's pretty difficult to eliminate anything that way, especially with
</I>&gt;<i> something that's intermittent like this.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It strikes me that I know very little of what I, as a user, can do to
</I>&gt;<i> try to diagnose something like this. I'd like to have more details
</I>&gt;<i> before I file a Mantis, since a description alone can't really be much
</I>&gt;<i> use to the devs. The steps I could take with what knowledge I have
</I>&gt;<i> are:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Examine OpenSim.log and look for anything suspicious-looking,
</I>&gt;<i> especially if it's happening repeatedly. Do the same with the
</I>&gt;<i> on-screen messages (difficult, since the virtual console only scrolls
</I>&gt;<i> back so far).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Look at other vital signs, such as network use and free memory -
</I>&gt;<i> in this case, these are normal. In fact, at 33-38% user memory used
</I>&gt;<i> of 2GB for four regions, that's better lately than it's been for a
</I>&gt;<i> long time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Selectively disable various regions and services, as mentioned
</I>&gt;<i> above, and monitor the situation over time. This is difficult, as it
</I>&gt;<i> naturally affects our use of the sim in the meantime.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Make sure that it is the OpenSim.exe process that's causing it by
</I>&gt;<i> using &quot;ps&quot; (in *nix) and similar tools to examine the process. (It
</I>&gt;<i> is).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What else can I do, in general terms? What debugging tools and
</I>&gt;<i> techniques can a user with little direct experience of OS's internal
</I>&gt;<i> machinations use to help pinpoint a problem? Is there any way of
</I>&gt;<i> finding out the resource usage of, say, individual modules? Of
</I>&gt;<i> getting more detailed logs? Anything?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Please note that the actual problem I'm having at the moment is only
</I>&gt;<i> an example - I'm interested in general in being able to be more
</I>&gt;<i> proactive in diagnosing Opensim problems, knowing as a developer
</I>&gt;<i> myself (though not in this project) how valuable more detail from
</I>&gt;<i> users can be in tacking a problem.
