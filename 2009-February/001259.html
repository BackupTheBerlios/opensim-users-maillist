<PRE>Everybody can use the &quot;Lusitania Tester&quot; region on WorldsimTerra-Grid, 
like Robert ask, and I'll do every week
a  OAR  and put the file for download  on the site.  If  everybody 
accept the  offer.

&gt;<i> Short Term Idea:
</I>&gt;<i> What about creating a single region on the OSGrid that everyone can put
</I>&gt;<i> their creations on and the person who owns the region can simply dump an OAR
</I>&gt;<i> file out once a week and place it where we can all get to it? Kind of like a
</I>&gt;<i> contribution sandbox. Again we still need to figure out WHERE to keep the
</I>&gt;<i> files but it might be a good start. 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Long Term Idea:
</I>&gt;<i> The same kind of region or regions as mentioned above, but as Justin
</I>&gt;<i> mentions (once he finishes the code), you just click on a box of items and
</I>&gt;<i> they get saved in some kind of OAR format minimized to just the parcel you
</I>&gt;<i> were standing on, or some other method as yet to be determined. This would
</I>&gt;<i> not require a file server but rather the region simulator acts as its own
</I>&gt;<i> kind of file server.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that imply some cleanup of the output from a save-oar against an entire 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> region? Even if that region has nothing in it but the new items you have 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> built? and are targetting for later sharing as OAR.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> This also raises a best-practice question about the amount of content to 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> generally put in an OAR in any sharing site. OARs could be as granular 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> as one per, say, sofa, or as broad as one per city block.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I would anticipate that something as small as a sofa would be transported
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as an inventory item rather than as part of a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> region (which might still be suitable for city blocks).  Indeed, there is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> experimental code for an inventory archive 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> format that I intend to do something with fairly soon.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As Robert said, OAR files are bulky.  To some extent this is a tradeoff of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> convenience against file size.  If all the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> necessary assets weren't contained in the oar then they would need to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> requested over the web.  There is a certain 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> inconvenience in making assets publicly available.  It's also not ideal if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you want to keep those assets private between 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> yourself and some trusted receivers.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, the advantages are probably great enough for a way for an asset
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> service to request assets dynamically via urls 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to evolve in the future.  These urls would probably be embedded in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> object url so that one could just toss xml files 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about (though I think there are still good reasons for bundling multiple
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> objects to gether).  Indeed, Cable Beach may 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> already be anticipating this.  I would anticipate that this alternative
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would supplement archives rather than replace them.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
