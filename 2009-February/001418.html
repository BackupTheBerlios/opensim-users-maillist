<PRE>Sounds pretty likely - too much flex can certainly drag a viewer to
its knees, and forests of flexi trees are notoriously lag-inducing.

The business of not being logged out properly is pretty common, at
least in my experience.  On SL, you can be forced to wait 5 minutes or
so before relogging, but on OSG at least it seems you can hop straight
back in - as soon as the server sees you reappearing it sends an
&quot;already connected&quot; message to the viewer and logs you out.  Happens
especially on viewer crashes, as it takes the server a while to
realise you're not there anymore.
