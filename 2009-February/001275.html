I've found it best to avoid using the &quot;flatten&quot; and &quot;smooth&quot; tools
near region boundaries, and just rely on &quot;raise&quot; and &quot;lower&quot; to adjust
terrain height.  You don't get the nice flat surfaces, of course, but
at least you can avoid having a visible join where the heights differ.

One problem I have that's somewhat related is in the textures on
boundaries.  If a region has different terrain texture heights in,
say, the west and the east, then the border where the east side meets
the next-door region seems to inherit some of the texture
characteristics of the west.

To give a concrete example, one of our regions is grass down to a low
level on the east and a higher level on the west (both north and south
quadrants adjusted for each side) where the region meets the ocean.
This gives us pure grass inland, but sand where the &quot;beach&quot; is.
However, along the eastern border, a land border with the next-door
region, there's a roughly 1m-wide strip of pure sand, which looks very
ugly.  We've not been able to get rid of that strip, and don't
particularly want to build on it.

Anyone any ideas on this one?
