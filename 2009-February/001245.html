<PRE>Hi Ai,

you should probably ask at the dev-mailinglist again.

There is a ongoing discussion how to handle feature requests, and since
opensim is not a product so there is no big guru in charge of making
decisions its sometimes a little bit tricky.

I fully understand volunteer developer that don&#180;t want to be forced to spend
their time in topics they have no interest in.

And I guess we have enough people out there who maybe volunteer on some work
- but the features requested get difficult to track.

Personaly I like the JIRA idea with feature request and votes on it, so
there was some measure of the demand.


So right now the only way is to bring up the topics in the dev mailinglist
from time to time.


Cheers
Ralf

Subject: [Opensim-users] LSL Scrip Functionality Implemented - Last

To: <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-users">opensim-users at lists.berlios.de</A>,
Message-ID: &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-users">49857ef1.01ac420a.1993.2236 at mx.google.com</A>&gt;

It was noted before that only about 27 LSL functions remained to be 
completed.  In bringing over materials from SL to Opensim, the main 
thing I have spotted is a few simple syntax and conditional handling 
things not yet in the Opensim end:

1. for (;i&lt;0...) where there is no initializer has io have the 
initializer put in explicitly as. i.e. for (i=0; i&lt;...)
This is already reported on mantis

2. if ( id &amp; (CONSTANT 1| CONSTANT2))  style constructs to do boolean 
ops on flags seem to cause problems.  I still have to check if its 
because the constants I was trying to use are not yet set in Opensim 
or if its the boolean ops themselves which are not implemented.

3. CONSTANTS - I am not sure if all are enabled.  We recently spotted 
the missing default media and transparent texture ones which are in 
the recent SVN builds. Thanks.  Someone who knows their stuff here 
and is familiar with the code and checkout/in processes (I am afraid 
that excludes me) might be able to do a thorough rigorous check that 
they are implemented?
