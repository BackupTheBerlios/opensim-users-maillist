Short Term Idea:
What about creating a single region on the OSGrid that everyone can put
their creations on and the person who owns the region can simply dump an OAR
file out once a week and place it where we can all get to it? Kind of like a
contribution sandbox. Again we still need to figure out WHERE to keep the
files but it might be a good start. 

Long Term Idea:
The same kind of region or regions as mentioned above, but as Justin
mentions (once he finishes the code), you just click on a box of items and
they get saved in some kind of OAR format minimized to just the parcel you
were standing on, or some other method as yet to be determined. This would
not require a file server but rather the region simulator acts as its own
kind of file server.

</I>&gt;<i> necessary assets weren't contained in the oar then they would need to be

</I>&gt;<i> you want to keep those assets private between 
</I>&gt;<i> yourself and some trusted receivers.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, the advantages are probably great enough for a way for an asset

</I>&gt;<i> to evolve in the future.  These urls would probably be embedded in the
</I>&gt;<i> object url so that one could just toss xml files 
</I>&gt;<i> about (though I think there are still good reasons for bundling multiple
</I>&gt;<i> objects to gether).  Indeed, Cable Beach may 
</I>&gt;<i> already be anticipating this.  I would anticipate that this alternative
</I>&gt;<i> would supplement archives rather than replace them.
