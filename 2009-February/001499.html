<PRE>Hi everybody, here comes Impalah again with some bizarre questions.

Before... about a question I did some weeks ago when I had &quot;problems&quot; with
avatar crossing regions: it's resolved at 90% from my part (ugaim) just
changing the (superslow) framework I was using to another; anyway the
requests made to ugaim from region servers (get inventory, get maps, get
something I can't remember now) aren't concurrent, at least running over
.NET vm (I have tested it in five different machines with win XP). I'll
return to those things when I finish the project I'm working on.

Well, my questions, overall are for who implemented Inventory Libs and all
the things around.

When an avatar logs in, apart from the &quot;personal inventory skeleton&quot;, the
user server sends a &quot;inventory library skeleton&quot; too. Opensim.Grid.User uses
the object InventoryLib (excuse me if the names are wrong, I haven't access
to the code right now) which reads the xml's from the &quot;inventory&quot; folder.

Ok, so an user server needs these xml files isn't it? At least for returning
the skeleton.

Well, but where is stored the inventory library? I suppose, because I
couldn't find any persistent storage for inventory library folders/items,
that the Opensim (region) server loads the xml files when it starts and,
when the viewer asks for inventory, it returns the contents of the xml's.

The problem is if I have several region servers, any of them with distinct
inventory libraries (folders and items). I have checked that if I return in
login, for example, only two of the inventory lib folders, the opensim
viewer will only show me these 2 folders, ignoring the rest of the
&quot;inventory xmls&quot; defined.

So if I pretend to distribute and control the inventory library from the
ugaim servers I have to copy the xmls to all the region servers who connect
to my grid... right?

I don't know if this is an error (I think the inventory library must be
requested from region servers to ugaim servers) or some kind of &quot;feature&quot;,
or if exists any reason for doing the things that way.

Can anyone help me with this?

Thank you
