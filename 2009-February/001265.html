<PRE>Hi folks,

I've just stuck up a new module called the Parallel Selves Message Bridge on the OpenSimulator forge at

<A HREF="http://forge.opensimulator.org/gf/project/psimb/">http://forge.opensimulator.org/gf/project/psimb/</A>

Direct download link is

<A HREF="http://forge.opensimulator.org/gf/download/frsrelease/161/377/PSMessageBridge-0.1.0.zip">http://forge.opensimulator.org/gf/download/frsrelease/161/377/PSMessageBridge-0.1.0.zip</A>

This region module allows you to exchange IMs with people on your friends list in another Second Life compatible system 
from within your own OpenSim standalone system (NOTE: this does not work on grid systems).  This exchange is done using 
the standard IM user interface within the viewer.

As such, it's something of a hack, since it uses libsecondlife/libomv under the covers to log in your parallel avatar to 
the target system so that it can use that to relay messages.  However, it could be quite useful in certain situations, 
such as when you're working in immersive full screen on building something in an OpenSim standalone but you still want 
to be able to talk to people on another grid without having to swap windows.

Although I've had this working for a while now, please be aware that I consider it alpha code.  Using the bridge should 
be no more risky than any other application that uses libsecondlife/libomv but I disclaim any loss/damage that occurs 
through using it :).  A base OpenSim build of r8214 or higher is required to use it (which unfortunately rules out 0.6.2).

I'll probably put a post on my blog with a few more details about this soon.

The code is BSD licensed and contributions/feedback are most welcome (there are forums and a tracker on the forge psmb 
page).

Regards,
