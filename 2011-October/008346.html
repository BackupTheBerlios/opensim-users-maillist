</I>Scripts attached to an NPC have been working fine for me. One thing to
remember (sorry if it's obvious) is that attachments on an NPC won't run on
land that restricts script execution to a group, or to the region owner.
This is unfortunate, as it makes using NPCs that have scripted attachments
while maintaining a defense against griefers pretty much impossible. And
since NPC UUIDs aren't persistent, you cannot have them join a group or
provide any real exception for them really.

Right now, you can either let everyone on your parcel/region run scripts so
that NPCs can run them too, or stick to controlling the NPC from an
unattached object owned by you or another privileged user.

As far as sitting goes, the best I've been able to do is to attach a chair
to the NPC, and use osAvatarPlayAnimation to perform a sit animation
tailored to fit the situation. Not ideal, but it works.

Part of the problem here is that it seems as though as far as the simulator
goes, NPCs are a first class user agent. It treats them just like any other
client connected to the sim, but without the network overhead. It would be
nice if NPCs were somewhere between a user and an object which could be
owned, and which either inherited privileges from its owner, or could be
assigned persistant privileges of its own.

Better stop there before I start on a whole long wish list. ;)
