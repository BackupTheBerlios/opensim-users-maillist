<PRE>I decided to spend some time this afternoon scouring around the web, and
found a useful comment on a board suggesting that with Blender 2.59
collada export, joint positions are an issue. This resulted in a solution
to the problem of exporting Evolver avatars. There is much more work
to be done, and perhaps those who are more experienced at rigging
might help out.   Many comments from others were very useful, especially
the files
by Gaia Clary at
<A HREF="http://blog.machinimatrix.org/3d-creation/blender-meshes-trail/rigg-your-avatar/">http://blog.machinimatrix.org/3d-creation/blender-meshes-trail/rigg-your-avatar/</A>

Here is a procedure with a blend file for you to play with

1. Download the latest blender 2.59. It is a nice interface compared
with older blender versions

2. Go to evolver.com and make an avatar. make sure to click on the &quot;pro&quot;
tab so that you
    can export your avatar as a Collada .dae file. Save the UV texture
map since that is needed
    when you texture your avatar.

3. Load the evolver.com avatar into Blender and use an armature that is
known to work (has
    26 bones all with the correct names that the SL viewer recognizes
and insists upon). I have
    included an example below. Just remove the mesh and substitute your
own from Evolver.
    Tune the armature so that it fits to the mesh.

4. After rigging, select both the armature and mesh and Export &quot;selected
objects&quot; from Blender
    using the built-in Collada exporter.

5. When in a Second Life mesh viewer (&gt;3 or any viewer that supports
mesh), Build-&gt;Upload-&gt;Model but
     this is absolutely key. On the upload options, CHECK &quot;Include Skin
Weight&quot; but DO NOT CHECK
     &quot;Include Joint Positions&quot;. If you want to have some fun, check it,
and see a curious piece of 3D
     avatar art that looks like something from an alien freak show.
Calculate weights, and upload.

6. Rez the mesh once uploaded and upload the UV texture map image that
Evolver gave you. Apply
     to mesh, and take it back into inventory. Wear.

Here is a .blend file to play with using an Evolver mesh. NOTE: it
doesn't include eyeballs or teeth. Anyone
who has rigged these onto armatures is welcome to add them. I am a
little rusty with Blender and managed
to lose them.

Again, many thanks to Gaia since I used the female model w/ armature to
start. This model is still there on
another layer if you want it. Note also that the armature is on layer #
10 if you cannot see it.

Start making Evolver avatars!
