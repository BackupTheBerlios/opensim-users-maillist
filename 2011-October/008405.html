<PRE>Actually I was not intending to imply that any of these groups had an
unfair role to play. As you pint out they have a vital and essential
role, both for the &quot;creators&quot; and for society.

I was actually thinking of a frequent whine of unsuccessful authors that
libraries are merely &quot;legal pirates&quot; since they &quot;give away the author's
work free&quot;. My problem with that statement is that quite often the
complaining author has very few sales outside of libraries and in one
memorable case my local library had almost zero demand  for his book!

In my own experience someone who is a success at any creative endeavor
faces far worse problems than any alleged &quot;piracy&quot; in learning their craft.

&gt;&gt;<i> What can I say? These aren't simple issues.
</I>
I heartily agree!

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There are excellent reasons for the exemptions, with the ultimate goal being

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> supposed to reflext those circumstances when protecting a creator's personal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interests would not be in the best interests of society. The issue of the US
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Government as a publisher also has to do with the work-for-hire issue. What
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can I say? These aren't simple issues.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The whole issue of Linden Labs and their constantly changing contracts is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> different. Part of the question is when contract law trumps personal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> intellectual property rights, and if this can be done via a click-through
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> license. That is a matter of some debate, and I have discussed this issue
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (specifically with respect to Second Life &amp; Linden Labs) with our University
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Counsel.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am not a lawyer of any sort (so listen to Karen before me!), but copyright
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> law is an old hobby of mine, and I have co-taught workshops on related
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> issues with copyright law specialists. For more insight into contemporary
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> trends in these issues, I recommend reading or watching Lawrence Lessig.
