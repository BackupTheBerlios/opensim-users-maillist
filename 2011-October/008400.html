</I>&gt;<i> If you go back into the history of copyright &amp; intellectual property law,
</I>&gt;<i> the origins stemmed from a desire to foster a positive relationship between
</I>&gt;<i> the creative individual and those who value their creative contributions to
</I>&gt;<i> society. The idea was that society at large benefits from individual
</I>&gt;<i> creativity, but when the work of the creative individual is stolen and
</I>&gt;<i> resold they often feel unappreciated and like &quot;Why should I even try?&quot; The
</I>&gt;<i> original intellectual property laws sought to prevent that problem from
</I>&gt;<i> occurring. It is quite enlightening tracking how incremental shifts in the
</I>&gt;<i> law over the years have resulted in a 180 degree shift, which is what we are
</I>&gt;<i> dealing with now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are excellent reasons for the exemptions, with the ultimate goal being
</I>&gt;<i> the benefit of society, rather than the benefit to the creator. The latter
</I>&gt;<i> was specifically to protect the former! The exceptions &amp; exemptions were
</I>&gt;<i> supposed to reflext those circumstances when protecting a creator's personal
</I>&gt;<i> interests would not be in the best interests of society. The issue of the US
</I>&gt;<i> Government as a publisher also has to do with the work-for-hire issue. What
</I>&gt;<i> can I say? These aren't simple issues.
</I>&gt;<i> The whole issue of Linden Labs and their constantly changing contracts is
</I>&gt;<i> different. Part of the question is when contract law trumps personal
</I>&gt;<i> intellectual property rights, and if this can be done via a click-through
</I>&gt;<i> license. That is a matter of some debate, and I have discussed this issue
</I>&gt;<i> (specifically with respect to Second Life &amp; Linden Labs) with our University
</I>&gt;<i> Counsel.
</I>&gt;<i> I am not a lawyer of any sort (so listen to Karen before me!), but copyright
</I>&gt;<i> law is an old hobby of mine, and I have co-taught workshops on related
</I>&gt;<i> issues with copyright law specialists. For more insight into contemporary
</I>&gt;<i> trends in these issues, I recommend reading or watching Lawrence Lessig.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If you look up 17 USC 101 (US copyright statutes) then you find about 20
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> line defining what is &quot;protected work&quot; then the next 5000 line define
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> limitations and exceptions that is what is NOT copyright-able!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The largest publisher of books n the world (US Govt) cannot copyright
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> anything for example. Teachers and libraries get some blanket exemptions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as well.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Worse yet, as a content creator myself the &quot;ownership&quot; of content even
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> content that YOU have created is far from clear. Linden Labs lays some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> claim to YOUR work! The exact nature of this is undefined at present,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but at various times they have simply forbidden ALL export of ANY
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> content, even content that I created.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> At that point I moved all of my stores etc. out of Second Life, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rarely even visit any more.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> MY solution has been to create stuff on my own private &quot;Diva&quot; grid then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> IMPORT it wherever I want to use it. Even that gets a hassle from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> paranoid grid owners sometimes.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> While I do not condone the piracy that is happening, I do understand the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> frustration that causes it.
