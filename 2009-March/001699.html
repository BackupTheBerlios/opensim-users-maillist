<PRE>There is one minor addition to ini configs that I would like to request, 
which I don't think anyone would object to. Can we have the ability to 
'include' other ini files within the current OpenSim.ini, and have those 
later settings override any previous ones? This way I can have myown.ini 
file included at the very end of any new OpenSim.ini file, i.e. only one 
minor edit for me when major changes have been made to the ini file.

Peace,
Sean

</I>&gt;<i> However, I also accept that my previous proposals may also not be the best way to go about this.  It seems that a 
</I>&gt;<i> complicated configuration story has already grown up around OpenSim.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately, I really need to turn my time and attention to other things and so I won't be doing any more work right 
</I>&gt;<i> now to revise this (and I've removed the config preview).  However, I may do some minor work to adjust the existing 
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim.ini[.example] to bring the 95% used variables to the top of the file and remove some of the settings which were 
</I>&gt;<i> originally experimental but are now effectively permanent.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If anybody else wants to pick up this ball and run with it then please feel free.  If nobody does then I may revisit the
