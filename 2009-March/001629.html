Load testing by assembling users in an ad-hoc manner has its place, and 
it might be a good way of keeping track of certain server-side behaviour 
and user experiences. However, logs from such sessions are limited in 
use, because the tests cannot be redone, and no statistics can be 
obtained. From our experiences we have observed quite substantial 
variations of certain load parameters with no correlation to what was 
been actually done in a particular instance. Identifying the causes of 
sertain bottlenecks or server behaviour is not easy, and multiple tries 
of the same test schema with varying only few parameters are useful in 
that regard.


Generally, there are three general types of tests, that people currently 
do on OpenSim.
A) ad-hoc gathering of users (as prescribed above), without the ability 
to replicate the tests or conditions, and without the ability to draw 
statistics on the server behaviour
B) more formal runs with real users (and real user clients) in a 
controlled environment, where effectively the same runs can be repeated 
over and over again to obtain statistical behaviour and identify 
bottlenecks by controlling limited number of factors
C) runs without real clients and without real users, where the inputs to 
the system are generated by TestClients that &quot;simulate&quot; real clients - 
these can be used as Mic Bowman explained to test various individual 
aspects of the server performance and these are ideal for tuning those 
isolated modules of the server


Each of these has its place and role, and they all play a complementary 
roles. At Otago, we focus primarily on B, where real clients are used to 
test the system holistically, and investigate different 
cross-dependencies between the server modules. I do not think Type A can 
be formalised or automated. As for B, we tried to automate as much as 
possible as to make the tests easier to run and manage, but, we are far 
from NANT-like automation.  It should be possible to automate Case C, 
and conduct multiple runs to obtain statistics in a fully automated way. 
We are quite interested in that, and will watch where the developments 
are heading.
