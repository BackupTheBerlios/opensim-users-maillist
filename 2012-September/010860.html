<PRE>Ok just to close the thread properly.So that you are not left wondering.
The mystery is resolved regarding the difference in behavior between
the exact same code (my actual code, not the snippet provided in this
thread) in SL and opensim.
I have a prim that rezzes objects with timers. Turns out that I never made
sure that the state of each object to be rezzed were
identical in both SL and opensim. So in the opensim case, when the object
to be rezzed were addred to the inventory of the rezzor,
its timer was already started. In the SL case, this was not. Then by some
accident, I added a stop timer event in state_entry
in the object to be rezzed in opensim case..... and things worked fine. NOT
because of the instruction to stop the time on state_entry,
but because I simply recompiled and that stopped the timer before the
object was put into the rezzor. And from there, was thrown
off a tangent.

This has given me a better understanding of the actual meaning of
state_entry, on_rez, and llSetTimer etc... Just saying, LSL is not
intuitive to me, but am learning.
