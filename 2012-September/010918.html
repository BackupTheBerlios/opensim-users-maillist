<PRE>Well said Edmund, you said what I was expecting to happen.
' so it ended
up being easier just to rez them where we were and tell them to move
to where we wanted them. '

and
' , it doesn't
always seem to be in a position to listen for and handle messages. I
think the issue is that it takes a bit of time after an object rezzes
for it to start running its scripts and start listening for messages. '

So unfortunately, I will have to do dirty coding again to make it happen.
Unless there is a compelling reason,
does implementing an opensim function RezObjectAtRegionCoordinates() going
to lead to problems?
I understand that 10 m limit might have been implemented to avoid griefing
initially,
for the same reason that llSetRegionPos is being implemented ... I think
there is a need for something similar for Rezzing.

How else could we do 'parametric building' and procedural based building
sim wide? This is quite important I think.
There are lots of viz applications that would require the 10 m rez limit to
be bypassed.

If dirty coding in LSL ... (also implying waste of tons of computing
resources ...listening to this and that message etc...) could allow it, I
think there is a need for a sim wide rez function.

Hope the opensim gods will answer my prayers.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks for the reply Daniel, I am trying to rez region wide ... objects.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I made a rezzer for sloodle once like this although we ended up not
</I>&gt;<i> using it. The objects were rezzed by a little UFO thingy (I called it
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;mothership&quot;) that would move to where you wanted to rez the
</I>&gt;<i> object and rez it there, then move back. There are a few ways to do
</I>&gt;<i> this:
</I>&gt;<i> a) The user controls the mothership directly - it flies to where it
</I>&gt;<i> should rez things, then flies back.
</I>&gt;<i> b) The user interacts with a stationary controller object which sends
</I>&gt;<i> instructions to the mothership.
</I>&gt;<i> c) Every time you want to rez something, the stationary controller
</I>&gt;<i> object rezzes a mothership and tells it where to go and what to rez,
</I>&gt;<i> and the mothership flies off, rezzes that object and derezzes itself
</I>&gt;<i> when it's done.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The advantage of this approach is that you don't have to put a script
</I>&gt;<i> in the object you want to rez. But since there's no
</I>&gt;<i> llDeRezOtherObject(), we ended up needing to put a script in the
</I>&gt;<i> objects in any case for when we wanted to get rid of them, so it ended
</I>&gt;<i> up being easier just to rez them where we were and tell them to move
</I>&gt;<i> to where we wanted them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> BTW, one thing to watch out for if you end up telling objects where to
</I>&gt;<i> move to - at least in SL, probably OpenSim too - is that right after
</I>&gt;<i> you rez an object (ie when the object_rez event fires), it doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> always seem to be in a position to listen for and handle messages. I
</I>&gt;<i> think the issue is that it takes a bit of time after an object rezzes
</I>&gt;<i> for it to start running its scripts and start listening for messages.
</I>&gt;<i> So if you need this to work reliably, you probably need some logic to
</I>&gt;<i> make the rezzer resend the message if the rezzed object hasn't got it
</I>&gt;<i> yet. (It may be enough just make your rezzer llSleep() for a bit after
</I>&gt;<i> object_rez fires and hope for the best...)
