<PRE>It is all very odd... I am seeing these Slow handling of POST 
/CAPS/... FetchInventoryDescendents2 fro an avatar that has LONG 
before logged out... and these go on a logn time and show fetches 
from 129.215.219.52:60671 (fro example) taking over 5000 
seconds!  5085055ms to be exact in one instance that just popped up 
on the region OpenSim.exe log even though the avatar is not ebe 
logged into a viewer. And there are many more at around that level of 
delay.  Can it really be 5000 seconds?  The sim is otherwise 
idling.  Have others noticed problems at the OSGrid level that might 
be the cause rather than (coincidentally) related to the new server I 
am setting up?

Melanie explained that these request might be from long before and 
queued up in the .net level... and that might lead to later inability 
to log in to the region (or do anything?)   Its very odd that we have 
not noticed such a serious problem before isn't it?

There is nothing obvious I can put on Mantis with this,, but I am 
investigating what I can from my end to see what could be wrong.  Its 
really unable even to get one region owning avatar into the region 
that has almost nothing on it yet.
