<PRE>&gt;<i> I believe you can create as many regions as you like in a standalone 
</I>&gt;<i> but you are the only person that can go there
</I>&gt;<i> I have created both and to have other ppl come to visit you need to be 
</I>&gt;<i> a grid 
</I>
This is not correct. Standalones can handle users from anywhere in the 
world, as long as the routers are configured for that.

&gt;<i> Basically, a standalone does not allow others to connect their region 
</I>&gt;<i> to your simulator, while a grid does. This has nothing to do with 
</I>&gt;<i> people visiting it.
</I>
This is also not correct.
Most grids are operated by one single organization/person and don't 
support the attachment of ad-hoc regions operated by others. OSGrid is 
an exception in this respect.

The difference between a standalone and a grid is simply the number of 
components (usually hardware) involved. A standalone has all services 
running in one single process in one single machine; a grid has many 
simulator processes, usually on different machines, and it typically 
centralizes resource management in yet other machine(s).

So if you just want a small world with a few thousand objects in world 
at any given time, stay with a standalone; if you plan to scale up, look 
into the grid configuration.
