<PRE>That's just mean, Standalones are people too.  (Kidding Watching to much 
U.S,. Politics lately)  People from the U.S. would get the reference.  
But so far my 49 regions and about 5000 items are growing along nicely.

But it is running on a Quad core with 8 gig of ram and a Terribyte 
drive.  Does this mean I should worry about lots of trouble a head?  my 
low upload bandwidth will limit the number of people on at one time.  
The best upload rates I can get around here is only 2 Mbps.

My grid isn't going to be like SL.  It will be a place to visit to teach 
a little history to those interested in seeing it.  It is Okinawa just 
before the Satsuma invaded.  When it was known as the Ryukyu Kingdom and 
ruled by King Sho Nei.  With 49 regions I can build Shuri Castle to the 
best of my abilities and have a 1/2 miles of land all the way around 
it.  Mostly woods and a small number of local villages next to the castle.

I hope I can do this with my machine or a few upgrades.  If no9thing was 
said about the corrections before I logged on, I would have.  I have run 
my Standalone a long time, and my partner in Building this lives in 
Australia and has been connecting to my grid in the state of Maine for a 
long time now.

Good luck all.
InuYasha.
