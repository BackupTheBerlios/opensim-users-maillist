<PRE>one other thing you can check it's the router firewall and see if you can
set up a DMZ host

I've done this with my router and have no problems connecting with Opensim

the only thing is the host makes your computer or server frontline to the
internet

Subject: Re: [Opensim-users] Awaiting region handshake

 

Thanks for the idea Karen,

 

I use to be a unix/linux admin so I'm pretty up to speed with any *nix
version. (unfortunatly these days my dayjob is windows servers).

Also, I just want to say  big thanks to everyone who's helped out thus far,
as I've been working on this for over a month and read just about every page
there is about opensim there is!

 

I even gave up at one point and tried a few alternatives like
openwonderland, opencobalt and realXtend, but none of them were anywhere
near as polished as opensim!

 

anyway, back to the story, I have another router at my house, and from the
research I've done, it *looks* like it should support NAT Loopback, so I'm
going to install it into the LAN that runs opensim this weekend (the server
room that server lives in is at a remote location, and I can't get to it
until this weekend.)

 

Wish me luck guys.

How about trying to display the Wifi (or other) login page from your LAN
as well as physically from a remote location - like a local Computer
Cafe/wifi access?

That should show if you have loopback problems pretty quickly and
showing the web page is very straightforward!

I don't know how much experience you have with Ubuntu Server, but I
understand that Ubuntu Server does need to have everything installed by
you - it doesn't come with very much pre-installed.

I have very little experience with Ubuntu Server, I run Ubuntu Desktop
on my server machine and it works nicely. Certainly uses more RAM and
CPU cycles than a true server would, but these are not major concerns
for me right now.
