<PRE>See basic definitions here, which is the model that has been guiding 
OpenSim development for a while:
<A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Virtual_World_Model">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Virtual_World_Model</A>

In principle, the concept of grid is orthogonal to the concept of 
simulator trust domain. In practice, and in the vast majority of cases, 
they are unified (i.e. 1 grid = 1 trust domain), but in a few but famous 
cases, they aren't -- that's the case of OSGrid, which is a grid with 
several simulator trust domains in it. If the concept of &quot;simulator 
trust domain&quot; is too abstract, substitute the expression &quot;multiple 
simulator trust domains&quot; by &quot;connecting someone else's simulator to a grid&quot;.

Technically, what makes a grid being a grid is having multiple simulator 
servers serving different portions of the virtual space, instead of just 
one simulator server -- that's all. One can run a grid with an external 
resource server (Robust, Simian) or without, using only simulator 
servers and a shared DB; the latter configuration is what I call 
serverless grids: <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Serverless_Grids">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Serverless_Grids</A> -- that 
article is outdated, but it explains the concept.

When there are multiple simulators (=grid), whether the simulators are 
operated by the same authority or decentralized by several authorities 
is a different issue. For example, the Avination grid and the SL grid 
are each operated entirely by one authority; the OSGrid grid is operated 
by a multitude of authorities [that must implicitly trust each other at 
the moment].

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks for the clarification Diva, me jumping in too quickly I guess.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I didn't think a standalone accepted region registration requests from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; other opensim.exe's, but that you needed robust.exe to accept
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; registrations from other opensim.exe's. I know that opensim.exe
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; handles all the services when in standalone - but thought it was &quot;cut
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; down&quot; and didn't support external region registrations. I take it from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; what you say it can do that? I've never even tried tbh.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What you say about owners not supporting ad-hoc regions being connected
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is of course true but that is a policy issue and enforced by firewall
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; rules. As far as I am aware robust.exe WILL accept a registration
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; request from other opensim.exe's if the port to it is left open. Of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; course, I may well be wrong with that but when I asked about this before
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (if there was any way to stop people registering with my grid - I was
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; told I had to block the port and that would be the way to do it).

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I believe you can create as many regions as you like in a standalone
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; but you are the only person that can go there I have created both and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; to have other ppl come to visit you need to be a grid
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is not correct. Standalones can handle users from anywhere in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; world, as long as the routers are configured for that.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Basically, a standalone does not allow others to connect their region
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; to your simulator, while a grid does. This has nothing to do with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; people visiting it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is also not correct.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Most grids are operated by one single organization/person and don't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; support the attachment of ad-hoc regions operated by others. OSGrid is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; an exception in this respect.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The difference between a standalone and a grid is simply the number of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; components (usually hardware) involved. A standalone has all services
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; running in one single process in one single machine; a grid has many
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; simulator processes, usually on different machines, and it typically
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; centralizes resource management in yet other machine(s).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So if you just want a small world with a few thousand objects in world
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; at any given time, stay with a standalone; if you plan to scale up, look
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; into the grid configuration.
