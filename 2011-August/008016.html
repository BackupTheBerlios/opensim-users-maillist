<PRE>Discovered that the link I had for Mowes no longer works, but did eventually
find the website is still functional. Not finding anything useful there. The
Mowes forum is working again, but there has been no response (indeed, no
activity of any sort) to my question on there either.

Sorry I can't provide any more details to this, but there are no more
details, it quite simply does not work. No errors, no sign that it knows
it's not working, nada. It just doesn't work. It worked the first time I
installed it, but it didn't the next time, nor the time after that, etc. I
did exactly the same thing that I did the first time I installed it. Of
course there must be a t I didn't cross somewhere, but I can't for the life
of me find what that is. It's been a month. I'm ready to give up.

subject    How install phpMyAdmin onto Mowes/SoaS?
mailed-by    gmail.com

Sorry for posting what appears to be a tangential issue to the list,
but the Mowes forum keeps throwing an error everytime I try to post it
there (Bad request: The link is outdated(!?)), and I'm having no luck
via the web-search avenue. Already lost too many hours on this.

I need to add PHPMyAdmin to SoaS (0.7.1.1), and it doesn't want to work.

I download PHPMyAdmin from MowesMixer, then unpack it to the same
directory as mowes.exe, as per the instructions. What next? The
included documentation.html file doesn't really seem to jive with
config.inc.php

Frustrating thing is that I had already done this previously, and it
was ridiculously simple - it &quot;just worked&quot;, as they say. Now I need to
do it again on what is essentially the same install (a copy of the
backup I made before installing PHPMyAdmin last time) and for whatever
reason it doesn't want to run when I start SoaS using autostart.bat -
although the MoWeS localhost webpage loads now whereas it didn't
before.

This is turning out to be one of those days...
