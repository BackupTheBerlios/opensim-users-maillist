<PRE>Hi and thanks for the module information

my groups was working fine but I will tinker with this newer version for a
while 

thanks for the messaging module it is working but not passing messages to
the avatar that is offline yet perhaps I need to set up the smtp I'm not
quite sure

the problem I have right now is with the profile module

only the picks panel and the avatars date seem to be working properly
nothing else will save except maybe classified ads but I need to get search
working right for that to be complete

seem like this is going to be a bit of a project for a while

if I can get it all working then a wiki can be written for everyone else to
use

I never tried xamp to see if it would work the floatsam groups module but
the zend server works ok so I'll stick to that 

thanks  again

 

TC

Gary

gbroups to work like they are suposed to:

I hope this helps you too.

And I found a more complete version of groups and they work fine so far.

Thanks for the files
I set them up and have some connectivity I know it's working because if I
change the db name it shows me the db not found on the screen
I get picks to load and the avatars date is now showing
I will see tomorrow if it is going to increment or stay at day one
I can't get a picture to stay in the database and no totes seem to work
the one error I get on the consol is the message I am sending is out of
range
but thank you this is a start hopefully with a little playing I can get it
all to work

OSGrid have provided a number of files for what I assume is their 
Profile setup
 
<A HREF="http://download.osgrid.org/">http://download.osgrid.org/</A>
 
osgrid_osprofile.zip for sources of the OpenProfileModule, 
.ini.example files and web server profile.php
 
OpenSimProfile.Modules.dll is the precompiled version to put in the 
bin directory
 
The following section goes in OpenSim.ini (up to 0.7.1.1 - and all 
standalones I think) but in GridCommon.ini for recent 0.7.2
 
[Profile]
    ; Change it to your own HTTP server to have the Profile server work
    Module = &quot;OpenProfileModule&quot;
    ProfileURL = <A HREF="http://profiles.osgrid.org/profile.php">http://profiles.osgrid.org/profile.php</A>
 
I should say though that my several attempts over the last year to 
get this working on Openvue have not been successful. So a wiki page 
with the most recent instructions would be very helpful for someone 
with knowledge of this.

 
 
The zip file does not seem to contain the necessary .sql instructions 
to create the data base entries used.  That is needed too, and was in 
earlier wiredux releases.  There were subtle differences between 
various versions I saw, and I have suspected that this is the root of 
my problem.  But I have checked my current DB table and fields 
against what the OSGrid version expects and it still does not work 
for me when I try enabling it.
 
I am placing a copy online of the .sql I last used - BUT PLEASE DON'T 
ASSUME IT FITS WITH LATEST osgrid_osprofiles.zip
 
<A HREF="http://openvce.net/resources/vw/osprofile/osmodules.sql.txt">http://openvce.net/resources/vw/osprofile/osmodules.sql.txt</A>
 
Maybe Nebadon or the folks at OSGrid could put the up to date .sql 
file into osgrid_osprofile.zip to brig this bang up to date?
Hope these notes help someone to get some working notes together on the
Wiki.
 
Remember there is a Wiki page already... which looks well out of 
date.  I hope  thne OS end of profiles can be a core part of OpenSim 
sometime, with a set of .php.example files ready to go.
