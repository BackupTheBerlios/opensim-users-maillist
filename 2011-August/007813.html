<PRE>I've had something like that problem on a hosted grid with bleeding edge 0.7.1 as it was then (Feb/March I would guess). The server would crash routinely on first access but after a console restart would be fine. Alas, the hosting company had not encountered the problem previously and despite their best endeavours was unable to track the problem down so no help for you there.



Best wishes



Peter

Re:  Unable to connect to local host...

My school's region is located on a hosted grid that is running a 6.9 OS installation.  In turn, I continue to have the problem of needing to login twice the first time each day I connect to the region.  That is, using either the Hippo viewer or the Imprudence viewer (as well as trying both my last location and home position), I always get an &quot;Unable to Connect&quot; message the first time I endeavor to login to our region in a given day.  Still, after completely closing down the viewer and trying again, I always am able to connect on the second try.  Note:  The only time I do not have to use a double login is if a student has beaten me to the first login of the day.

Does anyone know if the above a bug with the 6.9 OpenSim code or something else?

Thank you in advance.
