<PRE>Thanks for the clarification Diva, me jumping in too quickly I guess. 

I didn't think a standalone accepted region registration requests from
other opensim.exe's, but that you needed robust.exe to accept
registrations from other opensim.exe's.   I know that opensim.exe
handles all the services when in standalone - but thought it was &quot;cut
down&quot; and didn't support external region registrations.  I take it from
what you say it can do that?  I've never even tried tbh.

What you say about owners not supporting ad-hoc regions being connected
is of course true but that is a policy issue and enforced by firewall
rules.  As far as I am aware robust.exe WILL accept a registration
request from other opensim.exe's if the port to it is left open.  Of
course, I may well be wrong with that but when I asked about this before
(if there was any way to stop people registering with my grid - I was
told I had to block the port and that would be the way to do it).

&gt;<i> I believe you can create as many regions as you like in a standalone 
</I>&gt;<i> but you are the only person that can go there I have created both and 
</I>&gt;<i> to have other ppl come to visit you need to be a grid
</I>
This is not correct. Standalones can handle users from anywhere in the
world, as long as the routers are configured for that.

&gt;<i> Basically, a standalone does not allow others to connect their region 
</I>&gt;<i> to your simulator, while a grid does. This has nothing to do with 
</I>&gt;<i> people visiting it.
</I>
This is also not correct.
Most grids are operated by one single organization/person and don't
support the attachment of ad-hoc regions operated by others. OSGrid is
an exception in this respect.

The difference between a standalone and a grid is simply the number of
components (usually hardware) involved. A standalone has all services
running in one single process in one single machine; a grid has many
simulator processes, usually on different machines, and it typically
centralizes resource management in yet other machine(s).

So if you just want a small world with a few thousand objects in world
at any given time, stay with a standalone; if you plan to scale up, look
into the grid configuration.
