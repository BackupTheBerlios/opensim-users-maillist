<PRE>let's hope the leak is restricted to older objects I ran into an sql memory
problem trying to save some objects on my grid as well but since then the
error has gone away

I'm about to set up a 7.2 grid on another computer and see what the oar
files do there

that will be tomorrow I'm having problems with my sql though not ones I
can't solve

 

if you have a minute though you may have an answer to offline messaging the
messages are going into the data base but not to the avatar when it logs in

no rush I know you are busy 

thanks 

Friends in opensim

Subject: [Opensim-users] Resend errors on console

 

For a moment I thought the current subject of the memory leak was related to
my question.  Because my erros do say out of memory in them.  I found the
errors, thus far, have stopped since I removed and recreated a few recent
sculpties I had uploaded for use on my grid.

I used older versions created with a 3dsmax plug in that allowed the
creation of sculpty maps of 256x256.  I have been using the newer plug-in
called Prim Composer now for a while, but didn't remake those 256 x 256
sculpties.  I uploaded them and within an hour or more the errors would
start.  I loaded the models I created before and remade the sculpties at 64
c64, updated those and used them.  Now everything has been running clearly.
No memory errors yet.

Thanks for listening, I thought to let everyone know.  In the case that
others run onto this themselves.
