<PRE>
I have run Opensim both standalone as standalone and for the last three years PMgrid in grid mode so I understand the differences very well. 
 
However I can see where newcommers get confused when we talk about grids beings a collection of regions and then use the term &quot;grid mode&quot; to mean running using several servers or service instances in collaberation to run a grid.
 
I have often wondered if it wouldnt be better to coin a different term for what we currently call grid mode to avoid confusion. Maybe we could use Cooperative mode or Multi Service mode or Distributed mode to describe the alternative mode to Standalone. Something that better decribes the mode of operation rather than &quot;grid&quot; which I think should be used just to describe the region arrangement. Just a thought! 
 
When Intels DSG work hits mainstream (soon I hope) we will need to distinguish grids that run using the current central Robust.exe(s) and one or more Opensim.exe instances (i.e. what we now call &quot;Grid mode&quot;) to those that run the new even more Distrubuted services provided by DSG. 
 
Getting good clear terminology for mdes of operation defined now would help a lot in future I think.
 
Like I say just my thoughts. Any one else have thoughts on this?

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for the clarification Diva, me jumping in too quickly I guess. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I didn't think a standalone accepted region registration requests from
</I>&gt;<i> other opensim.exe's, but that you needed robust.exe to accept
</I>&gt;<i> registrations from other opensim.exe's. I know that opensim.exe
</I>&gt;<i> handles all the services when in standalone - but thought it was &quot;cut
</I>&gt;<i> down&quot; and didn't support external region registrations. I take it from
</I>&gt;<i> what you say it can do that? I've never even tried tbh.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What you say about owners not supporting ad-hoc regions being connected
</I>&gt;<i> is of course true but that is a policy issue and enforced by firewall
</I>&gt;<i> rules. As far as I am aware robust.exe WILL accept a registration
</I>&gt;<i> request from other opensim.exe's if the port to it is left open. Of
</I>&gt;<i> course, I may well be wrong with that but when I asked about this before
</I>&gt;<i> (if there was any way to stop people registering with my grid - I was
</I>&gt;<i> told I had to block the port and that would be the way to do it).

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I believe you can create as many regions as you like in a standalone 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but you are the only person that can go there I have created both and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to have other ppl come to visit you need to be a grid
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is not correct. Standalones can handle users from anywhere in the
</I>&gt;<i> world, as long as the routers are configured for that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Basically, a standalone does not allow others to connect their region 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to your simulator, while a grid does. This has nothing to do with 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; people visiting it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is also not correct.
</I>&gt;<i> Most grids are operated by one single organization/person and don't
</I>&gt;<i> support the attachment of ad-hoc regions operated by others. OSGrid is
</I>&gt;<i> an exception in this respect.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The difference between a standalone and a grid is simply the number of
</I>&gt;<i> components (usually hardware) involved. A standalone has all services
</I>&gt;<i> running in one single process in one single machine; a grid has many
</I>&gt;<i> simulator processes, usually on different machines, and it typically
</I>&gt;<i> centralizes resource management in yet other machine(s).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So if you just want a small world with a few thousand objects in world
</I>&gt;<i> at any given time, stay with a standalone; if you plan to scale up, look
</I>&gt;<i> into the grid configuration.
