I hope this helps...

Are you using an HP or windows 7  I used a web site at online port scan 
and my machine told me that my ports at 9000 and a few others where 
being used by something else.  I was having the same problem connection 
and having others connect to me.  My first few ports said this...

205.209.67.74 isn't responding on port 9000 (cslistener).
205.209.67.74 isn't responding on port 9001 (etlservicemgr).
205.209.67.74 isn't responding on port 9002 (dynamid).
205.209.67.74 isn't responding on port 9003 ().
205.209.67.74 isn't responding on port 9004 ().
205.209.67.74 isn't responding on port 9005 ().
205.209.67.74 isn't responding on port 9006 ().
205.209.67.74 isn't responding on port 9007 ().--
205.209.67.74 isn't responding on port 9008 ().
205.209.67.74 isn't responding on port 9009 (pichat)

So I scanned more and found a nice clear section to open in my router 
from 9030 all the way to 9085 if I wanted.  And I checked the other port 
I needed to.
Now logging onto my system means the address to log on is no longer 
ending in 9000 like most.  Like every who has to give links to their 
grid I tell them 9030 instead.

I use DYNDNS Updater for a permanent IP all that is free.  And my first 
of many region.ini files is set up like this...

[Shuri Village]
RegionUUID = 0692e48a-ca03-458f-a295-699a1cb2c67d
Location = 1000,1000
InternalAddress = 192.168.0.198
InternalPort = 9030
AllowAlternatePorts = False
ExternalHostName = ryukyu.dnsdojo.com
MasterAvatarFirstName = &lt;YOUR FIRST NAME&gt;
MasterAvatarLastName = &lt;YOUR LAST NAME&gt;
MasterAvatarSandboxPassword = &lt;YOUR PASSWORD&gt;
MaxPrims = 15000

Of course if you are on a LAN like I am, put your LAN ip in the place of 
my InternalAddress = 192.168.0.198.
A mistake I made in the past was using the entire 
<A HREF="HTTP://ryukyu.dnsdojo.com/">HTTP://ryukyu.dnsdojo.com/</A> in my External address.  Once I was set up at 
DYNDNS and got my DSN, all opensim wanted was ExternalHostName = 
ryukyu.dnsdojo.com

No one need try my grid yet. Only my web page tells about how it is 
coming, with images and links to stats and the news and blog.  I am 
still working on adding help pages another links.  But the sim is only 
open to a few chosen builders and close family for the time being.

It does work though.  One friend from Australia comes nearly everyday to 
build.

BTW:  I try to only open needed ports to the outside world.  allowing 
everyone access you all your ports don't make your system safe from 
hackers, greifers or bored kids looking for something to destroy.  I 
still back up everything.  Going DMZ just isn't safe.  You might just 
need to use alternate ports.

Also have to checked to be sure your router has loop back capabilities?

Hope this gets you started off.
