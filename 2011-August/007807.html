<PRE>I looked at LSL_Apis.cs class, the lsl functions llAttachToAvatar and
llDetachFromAvatar() are implemented. 
When I am trying to use them they silently fail or they don't work. Also the
Attachment constants of HUD like (ATTACH_HUD_TOP_RIGHT) are not highlighted
in blue in the script editor (Imprudence, Hippo and SL viewer)

If the functions are still not implemented can you suggest me an alternative
in OSSL functions (Although I looked at them) or C# scripting. 

I have another question:
I want to rez on a HUD, I asked that question on the SL forum but I get some
answers repeating what in the SL Wiki. Ther suggestion is that there is no
way other that Show/hide mechanism in my case. see link below:
<A HREF="http://community.secondlife.com/t5/LSL-Scripting/How-I-can-rez-on-an-Attachment-and-derez-object-on-touch-events/m-p/1014009/highlight/false#M4468">http://community.secondlife.com/t5/LSL-Scripting/How-I-can-rez-on-an-Attachment-and-derez-object-on-touch-events/m-p/1014009/highlight/false#M4468</A> 

The problem is that I have on my HUD a set of 5 thumbnail buttons (map,
video, audio, text, pictures)
I created an Object component for each thumbnail. Components contains all
functionality required and everything works fine . ie map object component,
audio object component etc...

Each Component has a different functionality, this is why it is difficult to
show and hide them one compartment 

one that show video using MOAP (Shared media) work unfortunately on SL
viewer 2 only

Another shows audio (using moap)

One shows a map( that changes depending on the location of the avatar), I
used some trick in Map API and Textures functions

a compartment showing pictures and finally one shows text (I may use the
&quot;fancy&quot; functions of OSSL that does not work or work with a million bug (the
server cached when I used osSetDynamicTextureData( )) some viewers even does
not show what Drawing functions should display(Phoenix viewer)

I want when the user clicks on a thumbnail, the component to be rezzed on
the HUD itself not in the environment and when the user clicks on a close
button on the component it die or kills itself.

And just a suggestion no offense. OpenSim is a great opensource environment
but instead of creating a new scripting language like OSSL, or posting how
fancy is to use scripts to connect outside OpenSim just implement everything
in LSL and then when you finish implementing all functions, think about what
functionality to add by another scripting language. If your not convinced
just think about how much code could be re-used (re usability) LSL is a weak
language I know but it does the job . Universities and companies want
something easy like Second Life to make a presence. So*Just be like LL
Server* not LL Server 2011 . I accept if you will be like LL Server in 2007
- 2008 ( stable and solid).   

This is not to make development efforts in OpenSim ridicule but because I
want OpenSim to get better instead of turning around itself in vain. I don't
want Linden Lab to swallow everything.
 
I bet No body  knows how to script in C# not even to mention the Region
module thing. Just few articles by Justin from 2008 and everything else is
crap. If you realize the comments on the article are till this year. Enhance
the wiki please and write some good guides. It save you answering forum
questions
