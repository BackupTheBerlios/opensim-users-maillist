Sounds like we have been going through the same sorts of experimentation:-)

We have tried Grid mode from Opensim 0.4 using MySQL and its been 
pretty stable.. but lacked a lot of interesting functionality, so we 
did not use it much.  We preferred to share experience by joining in 
OpenlifeGrid in particular as it has a responsive set of admins and 
user community helping each other If you are interested in an 
excursion... take a look at the events and some images at 
<A HREF="http://vue.ed.ac.uk/opensim/">http://vue.ed.ac.uk/opensim/</A>

In the last couple of months we have been experimenting with the 
prebuilt standalone from the opensim.be nightly builds (many thanks 
for those folks) , the OpenlifeGrd pre-built, the realXtend servers 
and just last week the 0.5.1 stable official pre-built system. All 
using the standard SQlite DB. These do seems to run fine for us (on 
Vista 32 bit normal desktops).

Given faster progress with this, just last week we thought we would 
go back to a 4x3 region standalone mode to keep things simpler.  We 
will revert to Grid mode for connecting in some region severs on 
separate machines when the community consensus is that this is being stable.
