</I>I'm going to assume you're talking about running a standalone OpenSim.

In principle something like this might be possible.  It depends on how 
the client handles the RequestTextureDownload capability (we don't 
currently use this method in OpenSim).  If this can just give the client 
an url to directly download a jp2 texture from, then in principle the 
region server could point it at any webspace url, as long as one doesn't 
mind exposing that url to the world.

However, I really am speaking off the top of my head here - I've no idea 
how viable this approach would be.  It does depend on the details of how 
the RequestTextureDownload capability works.
