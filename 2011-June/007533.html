I would have though that closing the dialog and reopening it would show an updated list, but this seems not to be the case.  I found the simplest way to get that list to update was to log my avvie out (I use Imprudence) and back in again.

&gt;&gt;<i> And I would really like some way of clicking an object shown in that list and getting up the 'build' window for it, so I can move it back to a better position or change its name.
</I>
At the moment, having found my missing object at the bottom of the sea or wherever, I have to follow the red arrow and physically walk to the object use the built tool to select it before I can do anything with it.  Some objects seem to be in unreachable places, or are in places where the build-highlight tool won't select them.  The only way to get at them is to dump the region as XML, change text in the XML file to put the object somewhere sensible, then reload.

On further thought I suppose that a fix for this problem would involve changing the client code rather than the server code.  Perhaps this means I should put these things in a list about clients rather than the server, but I don't know where.

Simon.
