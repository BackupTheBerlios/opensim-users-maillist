Yes, there are new messages. I suppose for example mesh support has added something. And MOAP and such earlier.

Certainly.

&gt;<i> I wrote the tutorial on &quot;my pet bot&quot;, but would definitely like to update it.

Right-o :)

Yah, sorry, I just thought you needed to quickly run some old bot and was afraid that it might not work.

I guess people have ported all sorts of stuff from libomv 0.7 to 0.9, Radegast comes to mind.. and I suppose the changelog has the api changes listed. I also wrote a follower bot once with libomv, it had simple chat commands you could use .. but that was years ago some ancient version. At least then new versions seemed to bring nice improvements. BTW Opensim was for long using an old version, but I figure it's a nice new enough version nowadays.
