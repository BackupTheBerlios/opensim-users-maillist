<PRE>okay, I'll give it a try then, thank you!

oh, and 1 more question, do I have to manually run an update on my dedicated 
server in order to get the most updated version of opensim?

You can use LL stable release viewers 2.7.2 (just out) and the
previous 2.7.1 fine at present too.

I have been doing quite a bit of experimentation with some very large
and quite complex meshes.  They import to 0.7.2 dev master versions
(those tested were around 15-Jun-2011 - as currently in use for
example on OSGrid.

  The mesh is really too large for Second Life (which appears to have
limitations on meshes to have less than 64K vertices.  Our model
started off as 5 times that and is still double that after some
simplifications.  Sample image at:

<A HREF="http://www.aiai.ed.ac.uk/~bat/EXPORT/3D/SC-Images-2011-06-21/2011-06-21-Supercar-03a-on-Openvue.jpg">http://www.aiai.ed.ac.uk/~bat/EXPORT/3D/SC-Images-2011-06-21/2011-06-21-Supercar-03a-on-Openvue.jpg</A>

The main thing we did find is that you have to have very good Collada
exports from your modeller.  Its quite sensitive to that. We are
still trying to work out what does and does not work and hope to
produce some note son the experience as soon as we can.  Likely in
August die to vacation.

I have found that upload of mesh with both the Model Wizard and
Advanced Upload tool work fine in:

LL 2.7.1 (for most of my tests in last 2 weeks)
LL 2.7.2 (stable release just out and retested as working fine still)

Kirsten's Viewer S21 Build 8 RC1

but NOT for some reason in Kirsten's Viewer S21 Build 8 RC3c or RC3d
or recent Beta viewers (like 2.7.4) perhaps because they are
developing a new image processing model.  I note the same visual
artefacts in these viewers when looking at the model previews, and
then fail to upload.
