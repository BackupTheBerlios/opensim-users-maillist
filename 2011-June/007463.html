<PRE>HI Missyfitz,

Many people will have their own recommendations for backing up 
databases, all relative to their own experience levels.  As far as I'm 
concerned (even as a seasoned tech) tasks like database management 
should be easy and require as little of our precious time as possible.  
There's a great web-based tool for backing up databases that I use and 
highly recommend to anyone of any experience level called MySQLDumper.  
It's open source and can be found here:

<A HREF="http://www.mysqldumper.net">http://www.mysqldumper.net</A>

I won't go into too many details as you can read about them for 
yourself, but I will say that it can back up single/multiple databases 
and compress them which makes archiving them very easy.  It takes about 
1 minute to install and has a fairly straightforward interface.  It does 
require a functional web server, preferably on the same machine as your 
SQL database(s) which is usually the case.

Check it out.  If you don't get all the info you need from the site, 
I'll be happy to help you in any way I can as I've been using 
MySQLDumper for some time now.  Cheers.
