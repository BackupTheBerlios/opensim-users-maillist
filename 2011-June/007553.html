<PRE>Thanks Chris, Marcel and Luisillo for your help.  I wanted to be 
cautious.  I do make backups using the mysqldump.  Right now while 
building and getting ready only a few members actually log on.  But the 
inventory is growing and didn't want sudden issues with items not being 
found.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> By upgrading from 5.1.41 to 5.5 will I get any sped increase, or do 
</I>&gt;<i> you think it isn't worth the trouble??
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am just a little nervous about upgrading.  It has been a long time 
</I>&gt;<i> since my opensim has run so well.  I don't want to screw it up now.  
</I>&gt;<i> The only issues I have right now, it might be client side.  In Hippo 
</I>&gt;<i> it is nearly perfect and only at some times I can't be seen by 
</I>&gt;<i> others.  Until I TP to another sim and return to them.  I tried 
</I>&gt;<i> Imprudence last night and no matter what I do others only show 
</I>&gt;<i> attachments, and they only see mine.  So, I returned to Hippo.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think I should write this alone in its own post.  At the moment 
</I>&gt;<i> thanks for the MySQL tips.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Your friend in opensim,
</I>&gt;<i> InuYasha

No problem at all. I did not notice any speed increase myself by 
updating to 5.5.x ... I would say that if you aren't having any trouble 
with 5.1.x or do not have need of features / security updates in 5.5.x 
that 5.1.x might not have; I would say stick to what is working for you =)
