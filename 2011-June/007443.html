<PRE>You can see what I am running via my tag line.   I have fought with it 
in the past with no luck.  I have help for someone who it seems part way 
through went off to college and I have not been able to continue on and 
make it work.  Can someone tel me am I confused?  It is really possible 
to get groups to work in a standalone with just the standalone and no 
robust servers etc.

I am starting to think I misunderstood and that I got confused about 
tit.  Kind of the way I wasted all kinds of time trying to get voice 
working with freeswitch only to find freeswitch don't allow the owner of 
the sim to use a DYNDNS name server and a permanent IP must be used 
instead.  I asked questions on and on, only to find out this bit of 
information later.

So I am starting to believe that is the problem with groups.  Maybe I 
never asked the right question and running the groups module may be 
impossible with a standalone.  I am loosing my patience with all this, I 
have been staying up late and waking up in the middle of the night over 
all this, over something that was supposed to be fun.  It isn't worth 
what little health I have left.

Distraught and feel wrecked,
InuYasha.
