<PRE>I happened to notice on my OpenSim.exe region console for one of the 
Openvue region servers that a lot of HG transfers were taking 
place... it was just one HG traveller taking the free boxes into 
their inventory.  There are I guess about a dozen boxes with maybe 
500 objects in total contained in them.

But I just happened to note that I could not log on my own avatar to 
that region while the transfer was taking place.  It balked at the 
region connection point each time.  I was able to log in to another 
region served by a separate machine. So I am pretty sure that ONE 
foreign avatar on a single OpenSim.exe server with no other load was 
sufficient to block out login attempts by a local avatar.   That does 
not sound right, and I assume it must be that its not sharing its 
processing cycles very well with default OpenSim.ini settings?  A HG 
inventory transfer of some hundreds of objects like this can take a 
minute or two (according to the logs) so it could stall the region 
for too long in practical situations, just because one avatar takes a 
free item somewhere on the sim.

I looked and I have &quot;BestAvatarResponsiveness&quot; set as my update 
priority in [InterestManagemeny] if that is relevant. I am using a 
very recent (ysterday) 0.7.2 dev master when I observed this.

Anyone seen such a slowdown or have suggestions of how to balance things better?
