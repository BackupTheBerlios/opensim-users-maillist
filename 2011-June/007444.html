<PRE>InuYasha, I do feel a lot of sympathy for what you're saying but the blunt fact of the matter is that OpenSim is very 
technical alpha software.  As you've found out, getting features beyond the basics working is complicated, often poorly 
or even conflictingly documented and may well involve hanging about and asking people on IRC (which can often generate 
no responses if everyone is busy/elsewhere).

I think that's just the nature of cutting edge volunteer-led open-source projects, especially one such as this where the 
architecture is extremely distributed.  It's not worth ruining your health over.  If things get too much I would 
seriously suggest leaving it for a while and coming back in a year or two, when things will (hopefully!) have improved.

You may also want to consider a hosted solution.  Running 49 regions on a single machine is also asking a lot 
technically, depending on how much activity/prims/scripts are on those regions.

As for groups, it is possible to get them running on standalone.  I can't remember what you may have written about this 
before.  With Flotsam, it should be a case of following the instructions at 
<A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/flotsam/wiki/XmlRpcGroups.">http://code.google.com/p/flotsam/wiki/XmlRpcGroups.</A>  However, this code is only very lightly maintained.  You might also 
want to check out the other groups alternatives at <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Feature_Matrix#Users">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Feature_Matrix#Users</A>
