<PRE>I have not followed this discussion all that closely, but I do have a few
questions.

My install of OpenSim did not appear to be affected.  However, I don't have
a need for the bleeding edge version, so I don't download from SVN.  The
version I have is one that I downloaded back in September.  (Of 2007, maybe
I should do a refresh soon!)

I went back into my version, and I couldn't find any easy way of determining
which version it was.  (I believe it was some branch of 0.4, but I'm not
positive)  Is there an easy way to do that?  Perhaps with the new versions?

If I connect to some OpenSim grid from the Second Life Client, is there any
way to determine which version of a grid or a region I'm connecting too?

I see that there plenty of versions out in the wild now, such as various
patched levels of 0.6.2, 0.6.3, 0.6.4 and the SVN version. Can someone
confirm for me which branches the prank was in?  Was it only in the SVN
version?  If I had pulled the perferred version, 06.4 Alpha with
post-release fixes, would I have encountered the prank?  What about the
0.6.3 or the 0.6.2 versions?

Personally, I want to thank everyone who has worked so hard on OpenSim.  It
sure has come a long way since 0.4.

  Apparently, you don't agree completely.


  'Useless' is a terrific overstatement, as is the characterization
'malware'. I tend to think of the whole thing as more of an easter egg,
especially given that the 'logic bomb' fires for only 24 hours.


  The real tragedy here is that so few have gotten the message with respect
to deploying this alpha software in a production capacity: Don't. And if you
do, be prepared for a rough ride.

    I agree completely. Here is a project where a developer (with the
    avowed support of other developers) plants a time-bomb that denotates
    weeks later, rendering the software unusable in a way that cannot be
    recovered by reverting to prior relases (which were aready secretly
    contaminated). I agree with Ralf and Stallings. Anyone who continues
    in such a project, knowing that this can happen again, is lacking in
    prudence, skills, and will certainly have nervous customers.

    By the way, how much longer is this thread going to continue? It seems
    to me that everything that can be said has been said. Developers
    (correctly) believe that they have the right to plant time bombs that
    render the software useless because everyone is warned that the
    software is pre-release (bleeding edge, trunk, whatever). I agree.
    They have that right, since they are volunteers and need to commit a
    &quot;prank&quot; now and then. On the other hand, some users (including me)
    believe that prudence requires us to shun such a project because,
    while we can live with bugs, which can be reverted, we cannot live
    with with deliberate malware, which cannot.
