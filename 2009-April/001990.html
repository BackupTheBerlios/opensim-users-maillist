<PRE>I also applaud the good ideas coming from the ReactionGrid folks. To be honest, I wish I had thought of some of them first, but thats just me.

As for .NET, GPL and BSD, OpenSim picked .NET for a number of reasons. It is a given and we see no reason to change. It is elating to see Microsoft-centric and Linux-centric developers working together and I hope this goes on for a long time.

The whole GPL notion has to do with tainting the BSD license. Many argue that BSD is a better license as it allows the user to do just about anything they wish with the source of OpenSim. OpenSim has adopted a very conservative approach and does not with to taint the existing license with too many GPL notions which then attach strings to the users of the OpenSim software.

Charles
