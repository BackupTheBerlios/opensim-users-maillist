<PRE>I rarely post here, but I really, really, really hope that your post is a
joke trying to wrap this up.

If not, please do us all a favor and take a long nap, count to 10, or
whatever you need to do to get a grip on reality.

Look in the mirror and ask yourself: was this really a big deal? No, it was
a fun little prank in alpha software on a day that many developers pull
pranks. Pranks were pulled on Wikipedia, Google, and many, many other
places. Perhaps you should get the FBI and lawyers on them too.

Though I doubt the veracity of this story; every attorney I know would quite
rightly laugh at you trying to prosecute such a ridiculous, minor, harmless
prank. If you lost your funding over something this irrelevant in alpha
code, then tell your funders to get a life as well.

My two cents.

Regards,

-Tim
