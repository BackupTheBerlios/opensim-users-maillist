<PRE>I would still argue that OpenSimulator will follow a predictable path
and that there's no need to worry about 'time bombs'.   April 1st.

A joke on April 1st, in the Development SVN is really *really*
predictable.  In fact, many major companies had pranks done behind
closed doors internally. OpenSimulator is not 'closed doors', so you
get to see the pranks that you otherwise wouldn't.  You can see
exactly what's going on with it at any point.

As I said in previous e-mail, I would recommend using anything but
tagged releases in any production environment.

Now, considering April 1st is over..    and there's no other time
where the world pranks each other, I'd say that there is no need to
worry. Furthermore, considering that I added the stick-bug joke, I can
make that statement.  You can even read all of my commits very
carefully if you'd like.

If you want to get the commits in e-mail, there's a list for it here:
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-commits">https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-commits</A>
This is a good way to examine every commit, I know I look at it often.

I would suggest that people, of whom this event turned off to
opensimulator, take another look.    Our history speaks for itself.

Sincerely

Teravus
