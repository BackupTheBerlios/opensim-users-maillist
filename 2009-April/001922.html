<PRE>Hello everyone.  To celebrate its 2nd birthday, the Fashion Research Institute (to which I belong) is holding a day of 
special events on its islands on the Linden Lab grid.

One of these events is an exhibition of artistic images taken from an OpenSim build called Shengri La Spirit, starting 
12 noon SLT, in Shengri La Hope on Saturday 4th April (tomorrow for most of us).

Shengri La Spirit is a region containing over 40000 prims that runs on OpenSim.  Shenlei built it up with the help of 
Zha Ewry from IBM back some time ago (when OpenSim was still in the 4400s!).  Unlike a straight performance test using 
plain prims, this was hand built as a real world artistic load to stretch out OpenSim.

We recently managed to disinter it and bring it up to run on a modern OpenSim revision (which was quite an adventure in 
itself).   It's actually very impressive how much OpenSim has improved in the last 4000 revisions, prim data loading, 
for instance, is soooo much faster.

Though we're not able to give direct access to the region right now, we're hoping that professional pictures will be the 
next best thing to show one of the many nice things that OpenSim is capable of :)   And so Shenlei and I would like to 
warmly extend the invitation below to the whole OpenSim community of supporters and developers.  Without you guys none 
of this would be possible.

The SLURL in SL is here:
