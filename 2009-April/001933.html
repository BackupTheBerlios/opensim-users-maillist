<PRE>Just a note,

We&#8217;ve been contracted by Michael Huntington (on this list) to implement a full groups implementation once we finish the secure currency one. We will probably push Groups into core once we are happy with its state on the forge. Planning for the groups implementation is scheduled tentatively to begin the week after next. (Would have been next week, but we ran into a glitch with currency during testing that needs some rethinking.)

Raise this issue again on the list in about two weeks and I will be happy to contribute our design plans, and maybe some very alpha code.

Adam

Ok. I agree, we really do need groups. I also like your idea for allowing outside access for other apps, though I think we should work on getting them usable first.

I altered the subject line to get us onto MUCH more positive things
guys and gals... this is a Great community, and we rely on many
personal time commitments from us all.  Don't spoil it.

I picked up on this post from Charles, and some 1-1 chat I had with
Justin yesterday on the same subject, because I think this is a
critical area that does need attention.  I was in a meeting this week
with with folks from IBM Hursley who might be able to encourage such
development amongst their own researchers keen on the area.

Lets find out what the state of play is, what exists and what is really needed.

For my own tuppence/two cents/two rubles (to try to be culturally
sensitive :-) )  we should at least make sure we can do SL style
group related plots, object change permissions and the like.  But we
should definitely not limit groups to the paltry 25 per avatar... I
have FAR more groups I am involved with and have to move stuff around
between avatars even in our early SL work being involved with a
lot  f educators and research groups on our areas at the Virtual
University of Edinburgh.

I wonder also if some sort of web interface to an externally defined
user information, avatars information, groups, roles set up that can
be externally managed as well as supported internally would make
sense to move this to a way to link up a social networking site with
DB based information with va range of virtual worlds including Opensim.
