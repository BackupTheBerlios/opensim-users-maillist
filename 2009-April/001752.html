<PRE>Skidz,

You will enjoy VBOX.  I have had some years of experience with this and that
virtualization due tu prior work.

I am not too technical any more, but was quite impressed.


The problem with sandbox of the type like sandboxie is, that they have no
baseline etc. So, what they do is a best guess what is right and what is
wrong.

You could add Appamor or something like that on top, to make it a little bit
more secure.

Don&#180;t get that wrong - those systems do actually help.


How does virtualization do the job:  it is the acceptance of calculated
risc, spoken in ISMS/risc management terms.


I have an (virtualized) operating system

I do patch it and secure it as usual.

I do NOT have data inside that is not needed for the testing inside (e.g.
opensim)

I have a maybe unsecure application on top.


So, if this system is compromised, it&#180;s no big deal.  It&#180;s very easy to set
up backup and recovery.
Even a denial of service would maybe crash the virtual guest, but not the
host.

If it is crashed/taken over - it is easy to get an copy for further
inspection.

If it is crashed for technical reasons, as easy for a debug copy.


If you even use a separate network interface - it is very secure.



I know a few system, that got PCI approval due to high security in a
virtualized scenario.


But - besides that:  I am very happy to see you here at the open source
front   ;-)


Cheers,
Ralf

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hey Skidz,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It?s a quite good idea to have isolated environment - at least if you
</I>&gt;<i> want/need to run opensim or other software in an &quot;unclear security state&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> on
</I>&gt;<i> a non dedicated system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I had a look into sandboxie and would maybe suggest to use a &quot;full
</I>&gt;<i> virtualization&quot;.  Since Hypervisor are not suitable for many people (need
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> run the virtualization on top of a operating system) and may have own
</I>&gt;<i> security riscs, regular emulation type virtualization works nice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A nice opensource project is vbox from sun.  <A HREF="http://www.virtualbox.org/">http://www.virtualbox.org/</A> It
</I>&gt;<i> comes with binaries for most linux boxes, as well as for windows.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In benchmarks compared to vmware server (not 3i), it did perform amazing
</I>&gt;<i> fast.  You can even swap premade system or virtual disks for diagnosis.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In any virtualization, remember to use a dedicated network interface card,
</I>&gt;<i> if you want to protect against denial of service etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So:
</I>&gt;<i> - great idea to make a save environment
</I>&gt;<i> - if you want a fast way and are not to paranoid about security or multi
</I>&gt;<i> platform sandboxie seems a choice
</I>&gt;<i> - if you look into multiplatform, or swapable virtual machines - or are
</I>&gt;<i> more
</I>&gt;<i> paranoid about security I would advice vbox
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I really love to see, that more and more people think about security and
</I>&gt;<i> production environments.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
