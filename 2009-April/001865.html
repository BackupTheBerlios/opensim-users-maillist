<PRE>Thom,

there are some lessons you learn if you manage companys, projects etc.

even if you e.g. reduce the headcount and that can&#180;t be friendly - be at
least politely.

If you need to make clear words, do that - but expect your conversational
partner to get realy pissed, there are cultures that are not to happy with
to clear words.


Besides that - basing a project on CVS/SVN daily product, you need to learn
a bit about how development works.

As a Project manager working with &quot;hot unstable code&quot; not getting your
funding partner calm because of a one day glitch (whichever type) means, you
have not to much experience in leadership - or realy the wrong partners.

Using opensim as well includes some aspects of the lincense it uses, wich
you seem not to have read up 2 now.

personaly I think, after such an email you would get a single chance in a 4
eye-talk, after wich you will send an apology or would have been fired.  See
how friendly is opensource if you can call developer giving things for free
&quot;assholes&quot; and continue making your money with their work ?

Maybe even remember, that this emails are kept in various archives. Think
about the impact.  If the owner of thomking.com will try to run projects in
the 3D, and a potential customer does some research finding that style of
communication...  the problem will be no april fools joke.


Thom - learn a bit more about your business (risc acceptance is a possible
method of risc treatment from the management view, so SVN may be ok.  Learn
to teach other about your business plan, including your risc treatment plan)
- or leave it.

Don&#180;t blame other for a lack of skills, prudence or you nervous customers.



Cheers,
Ralf

 I just found out our OpenSim-Grid-based project has lost our 
 funding because of some stunt you assholes pulled in the OpenSim 
 code.  You are despicable!  There is no possible excuse for what 
 you have done.
