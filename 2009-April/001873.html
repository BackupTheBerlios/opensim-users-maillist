</I>&gt;&gt;<i> At the moment, we do not have any paying customers and its likely 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> going to be some time before we're able to accommodate such 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> creatures.  Mainly, our plan for now is to simply provide a free 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> access grid to various genre of roleplayers and then further down the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> road once both OpenSim and my add-ons (mostly web and unix stuff) are 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ready enough (as well after we have some environments operational) we 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> were planning on subsidizing the server costs by offering land rentals 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in each environment for players to use as their in-character homes. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Another possibility after the fact may be to begin renting clusters of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> simulators for others to add in their own roleplay environments.  As 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> far as in-world assets are concerned, we're modeling everything after 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the Arcadia Asylum approach where our in-world currency will have no 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> real world value and everything should be available preferably with 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> full permissions for no fee.  In all for now we're not expecting to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nor are we seeking to generate a profit.  However in the unlikely 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> event that we do wind up generating a profit we would likely be 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> accepting resumes for a developer! :)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As for riding the bleeding edge (and gosh that sounds gruesome!) going 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by everyone's input I'd think for now since we're still building it 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sounds relatively safe for us to continue that route provided we keep 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in step with the backups and pay attention to warnings on the mailing 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> list.  As well stick to the recommended releases that Charles alluded 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to.  But, in future once we start seeing heavy loads and possibly 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> start pulling in some kind of income to pay for all of this we may 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> need to step back a bit and only keep one cluster on the bleeding edge 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for testing (probably our gateway / entry point Ellis) while the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> others would remain on the stable releases.  Although, be that as it 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> may we've not had to submit many bug reports recently - GOOD JOB GANG! :)
</I>
Sounds very sensible, John, and the grid sounds like a lot of fun :).

Maybe the blessing in disguise from all this is that better 'best practices' for managing grids and an improved OpenSim 
release process will emerge.

&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As for attending Office Hours, yes I'll admit it I'm a night dweller! 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But for the sake of contributing I'll do my best to crawl out of bed 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and drag my pajama ridden zombified self over to OSGrid at 3:00 in the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> afternoon.  Now that I realize that its Tuesday at 3:00 pm my time and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not Monday at 11:00 am pacific. 
</I>
What kind of job do you do that let's you sleep in all day? :)

I look forward to seeing you at the meetings too. There's always been talk of setting up an extra Office Hours meeting 
at time more suitable for people such as yourself.  This hasn't happened yet but maybe it will if enough demand comes about.

&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thank you all once again...  Live long and prosper!  \\//
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>
Indeed \\//
