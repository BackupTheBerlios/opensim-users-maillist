This doesn't happen in 0.6.3.

going to have something like a full blown exploit, or DB crashing bug,
or similar. You are a lot safer in a somewhat tested and confirmed
stable branch than you are on trunk.Trunk is very much an 'at risk'
environment, and people putting OpenSim into production need to be
aware of this fact. If nothing else, this prank has given the
opportunity to highlight the importance of sticking to a tagged
release for production work.

trunk is being used as it should be. As a place to do development,
knowing that sometimes what we do will cause new problems rather than
fix older problems in opensim. Trunk isn't a daily release system for
people wanting stable versions. Its great that lots of people run it
to help test and debug opensim. But it shouldn't be used when people
don't want to take all the risks that come with it.

Gentlemen, you are utterly missing the point. When we decided to try
out Opensim (trunk, bleeding edge) it was in the hope that our usage
might help uncover problems. We made this decision with the full and
concious knowledge that trunk could break due to: (1) unanticipated
interaction among modules, (2) simultaneous incompatible changes to
different modules (3) well-intentioned changes that break something,
or (4) programmer carelessness, fatigue, sleeplessness, whatever. For
each of these contingencies we have procedures in place. We can (and
often do) fall back to prior releases within minutes.

But we did not and cannot anticipate deliberate vandalism by a trusted
developer. Reverting to prior releases cannot work in such cases
because the time-bomb might have been planted weeks, months, even
years ago.

I understand that some of you kind and dedicated folks simply cannot 
grasp the difference between accidental (and revertable) breakage on 
the one hand, and a deliberately planted (and unrevertable) time-bomb 
on the other. If most of Opensim's developers also cannot grasp this 
difference, then I assure you that the project is doomed in the real 
world.
