<PRE>A lot of what transpired was because it was apparently not clear enough
about not using trunk.  So that there isn't such confusion in the
future, I've removed the direct SVN link off the front page, and moved
the trunk links to this section of the Downloads page
(<A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Download">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Download</A>) :

Experimental Upstream Code

There Be Dragons Beyond This Point

If you are truly feeling dangerous, adventurous, or want to help us test
the next version of OpenSim you are welcome to grab the latest unstable
code out of our subversion trunk. Any warnings previous expressed about
the alpha nature of the code go double or triple if you are running
directly off of trunk. Never, ever, ever, never run this in production
environments, it is not suitable for that unless you are very familiar
with the source code, and can hot fix any piece of it (that probably
means you are an OpenSim core member). Feedback and testing on the
unstable tree is appreciated, as that helps us make the next release
better. If this scares you from using trunk, that was intended.

If it breaks, you get to keep both pieces.

    * Latest Subversion revision version (bleeding edge)
...


I replicate this here, because there are plenty of people that already
have a trunk tree, hopefully they'll get this message here if not via
the website.

I'd also ask a favor from our users, if you find links to SVN anywhere
else in the wiki, please remove them, and just link in the Downloads
page.  If anyone in IRC asks you how to get source, please don't give
them a direct svn command, please send them to that page.  Everyone
getting svn trunk needs to read that paragraph, and really internalize it.

Apologies to people for which this makes it a couple more steps to get
code who understand trunk, and continue to be incredible testers for
this incredible project.

Thanks folks,

	-Sean
