<PRE>Anyway, was funny ...

I'm anxious to see what will happen next year in the same period ...
This joke was inventive and well prepared. So &quot;bravo&quot; to the person who 
has implemented it for over a month without being seen.

And at least, thanks again to the whole developers spending their time 
for OpenSim.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> aware of this fact. If nothing else, this prank has given the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> opportunity to highlight the importance of sticking to a tagged

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to help test and debug opensim. But it shouldn't be used when people
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> don't want to take all the risks that come with it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Gentlemen, you are utterly missing the point. When we decided to try
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> out Opensim (trunk, bleeding edge) it was in the hope that our usage
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> might help uncover problems. We made this decision with the full and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> concious knowledge that trunk could break due to: (1) unanticipated
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interaction among modules, (2) simultaneous incompatible changes to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> different modules (3) well-intentioned changes that break something,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or (4) programmer carelessness, fatigue, sleeplessness, whatever. For
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> each of these contingencies we have procedures in place. We can (and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> often do) fall back to prior releases within minutes.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But we did not and cannot anticipate deliberate vandalism by a trusted
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> developer. Reverting to prior releases cannot work in such cases
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> because the time-bomb might have been planted weeks, months, even
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> years ago.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Frank, this really isn't 'deliberate vandalism', it's a fun April Fool's joke.  If one is following closely trunk then 
</I>&gt;<i> one has to be prepared for this kind of thing, which will only last one day and has a patch in
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.linkedin.com/e/avn/30232980/744527/EML_anet_nws_title-cThOon0JumNFomgJt7dBpSBA/">http://www.linkedin.com/e/avn/30232980/744527/EML_anet_nws_title-cThOon0JumNFomgJt7dBpSBA/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> by which it can be readily reverted.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The 'time-bomb' itself was planted only two and a half weeks ago and I have no doubt that it would not have been done 
</I>&gt;<i> any earlier (let alone months or years earlier) due to the risk that it might slip into a release or release candidate. 
</I>&gt;<i>   The fact that it may have got into a 0.6.4 RC is unfortunate so maybe the time period before 'detonation' should be a 
</I>&gt;<i> bit shorter.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I understand that some of you kind and dedicated folks simply cannot 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> grasp the difference between accidental (and revertable) breakage on 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the one hand, and a deliberately planted (and unrevertable) time-bomb 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on the other. If most of Opensim's developers also cannot grasp this 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> difference, then I assure you that the project is doomed in the real 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> world.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With all due respect, the project is much more likely to be doomed in the real world if we can't find developers to work 
</I>&gt;<i> on it.  And many of those who contribute the most are doing it out of sheer altruism.  We all need to have some fun and 
</I>&gt;<i> a nice joke now and again.
