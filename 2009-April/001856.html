<PRE>Hello!

I am really sad to hear this, as I have worked very hard over the past
couple of weeks to port the Sloodle objects over to OpenSim. We had the
first class in OpenSim using the Sloodle tools last Saturday. And it looks
to be very promising. I'm sad that you and your organization will be missing
out on so much. Because the Sloodle tools will really find a home here in
OpenSim with the advanced scripting and open codebase we have to work with.
But, really I think that if

      1) you are reluctant to follow the guidelines for deploying production
grids with the appropriate tagged releases
      2) are determined to place the blame for your own folly on others
      3) let a couple of bumps cause you to quit
      4) just forgot to have fun....

you were probably destined to fail to start with.

Sorry if this seems harsh, but I have too much appreciation for the
development team and the code they produce. And I have heard this drivel all
day long, and I'm really sick of it. Good luck...

Sincerely,
BlueWall
