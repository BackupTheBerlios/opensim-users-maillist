<PRE>James Stallings II wrote, &quot;Bravo Ralf, well done,&quot; refering to a
message by Ralf Haifisch that ends with, &quot;Don&#180;t blame other for a lack
of skills, prudence or you nervous customers.&quot;

I agree completely. Here is a project where a developer (with the
avowed support of other developers) plants a time-bomb that denotates
weeks later, rendering the software unusable in a way that cannot be
recovered by reverting to prior relases (which were aready secretly
contaminated). I agree with Ralf and Stallings. Anyone who continues
in such a project, knowing that this can happen again, is lacking in
prudence, skills, and will certainly have nervous customers.

By the way, how much longer is this thread going to continue? It seems
to me that everything that can be said has been said. Developers
(correctly) believe that they have the right to plant time bombs that
render the software useless because everyone is warned that the
software is pre-release (bleeding edge, trunk, whatever). I agree.
They have that right, since they are volunteers and need to commit a
&quot;prank&quot; now and then. On the other hand, some users (including me)
believe that prudence requires us to shun such a project because,
while we can live with bugs, which can be reverted, we cannot live
with with deliberate malware, which cannot.
