<PRE>My advice would be run both.

We don't up the protocol version too often - so there's nothing stopping you from running a handful of regions at trunk, and the remainder on stable. If you have customers involved, while we appreciate the feedback - I would probably say stick with stable there. 

For your own testing purposes, running trunk isn't a bad option - and it also gives you the flexibility that if something is broken majorly, you still have all your stable regions.

To be fair, the 0.6.3 release was not fantastic - the avatar bug should have probably been fixed before that was tagged. I think in future that complaint has registered pretty soundly and releases might be more thoroughly tested through release candidates.
