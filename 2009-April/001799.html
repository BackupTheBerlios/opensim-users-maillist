<PRE>Not trying to keep this whole thing dragging on. But if this did crash hippo viewers than something good has came out of it as we have discovered a bug, either in hippo viewer or in opensim's animation generating code. Because all this does is plays a animation on the avatars.

It's a marvellous effect, and we did have a laugh about it last night while
doing a tour with a potential client (discovered the server we were on at the
time was set to the wrong timezone, hence the early appearance). But it
wasn't just stick avatars, several folks Hippos crashed out. 

There's a bit of an issue that I don't believe many core testers use
MSSQL, hence I can't trust that what one person tags as stable will be
stable for me. 0.6.1 required an additional patch for MSSQL because there were
fundamental core changes that had happened between 0.6.0 and 0.6.1. Since having
experienced that problem (before we formally launched our grid) I&#8217;ve run with
my own tests and procedures. I've got a big test plan and did two weeks of
testing before upgrading. I like using MSSQL, it's what I'm familiar
with, I'm not switching, I believe it's a great platform for OpenSim (as
proved by ReactionGrid now over 100 regions), and I want to help improve it. 

This is the first Open Source project I've ever worked with, and I
didn't start looking at it til May last year - I had no clue that this was
coming and was caught very much off-guard this morning. Seriously, I'd woken
up thinking how glad I was that I didn't have to reboot all the servers
every morning since the upgrade, relaxed that I could reclaim an extra 20-30
mins a day from that improvement alone, and that's all thanks to the great
stuff you guys have been doing. I'm very sorry if I have offended anyone
with my response. It didn't take a massive amount of time to fix, a couple
of hours before most Gridizens woke up, and I am very grateful for Teravus's
help over IRC in getting a patch together that worked on rev 8831. Yes, I should
have stuck to the RC, but I saw some great bug fixes going into trunk in the
week after that initial tag was made that made the whole idea of upgrading a
teeny bit further quite appealing. And again I speak in my own defence - I did
test, test, and test again and I can say that apart from this
&quot;feature&quot;, 8831 is working out really well for us! I would rather not
be so far off trunk that our grid can be of little help to the main OpenSim
development process. One example is the Sloodle to OpenSim port that has been
worked on in both OSGrid and ReactionGrid. We at ReactionGrid want to be part of
those sorts of projects that directly lead to core code improvements if
possible, and are willing to shoulder some risk in order to help with that.

This is a very funny joke - I love the long tentacled avatars.

However, I can appreciate your frustration, Chris.  I think that it's
unfortunate that 0.6.3 suffers from an avatar 
appearance regression that hasn't been addressed.  That's not to
disrespect the efforts of Charles, Stefan and other 
folk who manage the releases.  They do a fine job, though I think the would
also agree that our releases are still more 
or less finger in the air, does this seem stable? affairs (though perhaps
Stefan is trying to change this by doing 
release candidates).

To some extent I think it's a manpower problem.  Until there is a really
great desire for stable releases as opposed to 
trunk snapshots, then the effort won't go in to assuring this.

Having said that, I think that it's unfortunate if some fun code crept into
a 0.6.4 release candidate - perhaps it 
should be put in a little nearer April 1.

</I>&gt;<i>     Given that 0.6.3 was not a good release (avatar appearance bugs), I
</I>&gt;<i>     was hoping to wait for 0.6.4 for ReactionGrid and for our clients.
</I>&gt;<i>     It was taking a while to tag, and I had identified a stable revision
</I>&gt;<i>     that I had put through a lot of testing and made the call based on
</I>&gt;<i>     running a significant test plan. Our database (MSSQL) was over 5Gb,
</I>&gt;<i>     the change from 0.6.2 to 0.6.4 included a major schema change that
</I>&gt;<i>     meant the longer we left updating, the longer (and harder) an update
</I>&gt;<i>     was gonna be. I made the call to update us just before Stefan tagged
</I>&gt;<i>     the release &#8211; I didn&#8217;t anticipate this particular outcome.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     I will take full responsibility if there is a bug in opensim code
</I>&gt;<i>     that affects my clients that would have been prevented if I had used
</I>&gt;<i>     a stable branch, but I do actually trust you guys too &#8211; you do
</I>great
&gt;<i>     work, I read every commit log (evidently not thoroughly enough) and
</I>&gt;<i>     I use my experience to make a call on whether a breaking change has
</I>&gt;<i>     been put in or not. In this situation, what would have been nice
</I>&gt;<i>     would have been a simple switch to return to normal. We saw the joke
</I>&gt;<i>     last night and yes, we fell about laughing, thinking it was a freaky
</I>&gt;<i>     occurrence on a highly-loaded sim, never for one moment realising
</I>&gt;<i>     this was going to strike all our servers today.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     ReactionGrid is a young business, we&#8217;re pushing out there to find
</I>&gt;<i>     customers who are willing to go with us through the bumps, ride the
</I>&gt;<i>     fun little features, because we really do believe in the platform,
</I>&gt;<i>     even at this early stage. I didn&#8217;t start working with OpenSim til
</I>&gt;<i>     May last year, so I didn&#8217;t know this was likely to happen.

</I>&gt;<i>     I understand that it has caused you problems and we are sorry for
</I>&gt;<i>     that but to be honest, its not a good idea to be running trunk in
</I>&gt;<i>     any production set up or for business use. Trunk is for development
</I>&gt;<i>     and can be broke at any time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     We do release &quot;stable&quot; tagged versions and we strongly
</I>suggest that
&gt;<i>     anyone using opensim for business or production use sticks to those.
</I>&gt;<i>     They all have their problems but trunk just can't be depended on
</I>to
&gt;<i>     be working/stable or anything.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     The only people who should be using trunk are developers, testers
</I>&gt;<i>     and people who want to try the very lastest changes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     All the developers work very hard for nothing in return so its a
</I>&gt;<i>     small thing for some of us to put a small pank in TRUNK once a year.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Again I do understand it has caused you some problems but we offer
</I>&gt;<i>     all our work free and as I said we strongly advise people to use the
</I>&gt;<i>     tagged versions.
