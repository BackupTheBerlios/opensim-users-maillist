</I>&gt;<i> At the moment, we do not have any paying customers and its likely 
</I>&gt;<i> going to be some time before we're able to accommodate such 
</I>&gt;<i> creatures.  Mainly, our plan for now is to simply provide a free 
</I>&gt;<i> access grid to various genre of roleplayers and then further down the 
</I>&gt;<i> road once both OpenSim and my add-ons (mostly web and unix stuff) are 
</I>&gt;<i> ready enough (as well after we have some environments operational) we 
</I>&gt;<i> were planning on subsidizing the server costs by offering land rentals 
</I>&gt;<i> in each environment for players to use as their in-character homes. 
</I>&gt;<i> Another possibility after the fact may be to begin renting clusters of 
</I>&gt;<i> simulators for others to add in their own roleplay environments.  As 
</I>&gt;<i> far as in-world assets are concerned, we're modeling everything after 
</I>&gt;<i> the Arcadia Asylum approach where our in-world currency will have no 
</I>&gt;<i> real world value and everything should be available preferably with 
</I>&gt;<i> full permissions for no fee.  In all for now we're not expecting to 
</I>&gt;<i> nor are we seeking to generate a profit.  However in the unlikely 
</I>&gt;<i> event that we do wind up generating a profit we would likely be 
</I>&gt;<i> accepting resumes for a developer! :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for riding the bleeding edge (and gosh that sounds gruesome!) going 
</I>&gt;<i> by everyone's input I'd think for now since we're still building it 
</I>&gt;<i> sounds relatively safe for us to continue that route provided we keep 
</I>&gt;<i> in step with the backups and pay attention to warnings on the mailing 
</I>&gt;<i> list.  As well stick to the recommended releases that Charles alluded 
</I>&gt;<i> to.  But, in future once we start seeing heavy loads and possibly 
</I>&gt;<i> start pulling in some kind of income to pay for all of this we may 
</I>&gt;<i> need to step back a bit and only keep one cluster on the bleeding edge 
</I>&gt;<i> for testing (probably our gateway / entry point Ellis) while the 
</I>&gt;<i> others would remain on the stable releases.  Although, be that as it 
</I>&gt;<i> may we've not had to submit many bug reports recently - GOOD JOB GANG! :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for attending Office Hours, yes I'll admit it I'm a night dweller! 
</I>&gt;<i> But for the sake of contributing I'll do my best to crawl out of bed 
</I>&gt;<i> and drag my pajama ridden zombified self over to OSGrid at 3:00 in the 
</I>&gt;<i> afternoon.  Now that I realize that its Tuesday at 3:00 pm my time and 
</I>&gt;<i> not Monday at 11:00 am pacific. 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you all once again...  Live long and prosper!  \\//
