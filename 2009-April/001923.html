I altered the subject line to get us onto MUCH more positive things 
guys and gals... this is a Great community, and we rely on many 
personal time commitments from us all.  Don't spoil it.

I picked up on this post from Charles, and some 1-1 chat I had with 
Justin yesterday on the same subject, because I think this is a 
critical area that does need attention.  I was in a meeting this week 
with with folks from IBM Hursley who might be able to encourage such 
development amongst their own researchers keen on the area.

Lets find out what the state of play is, what exists and what is really needed.

For my own tuppence/two cents/two rubles (to try to be culturally 
sensitive :-) )  we should at least make sure we can do SL style 
group related plots, object change permissions and the like.  But we 
should definitely not limit groups to the paltry 25 per avatar... I 
have FAR more groups I am involved with and have to move stuff around 
between avatars even in our early SL work being involved with a 
lot  f educators and research groups on our areas at the Virtual 
University of Edinburgh.

I wonder also if some sort of web interface to an externally defined 
user information, avatars information, groups, roles set up that can 
be externally managed as well as supported internally would make 
sense to move this to a way to link up a social networking site with 
DB based information with va range of virtual worlds including Opensim.
