<PRE>For any actions/decisions to be made about groups of people, you need, 
first of all, and as DrScofield says, a group system. That is, you need 
a system that supports the concept of &quot;group&quot; and allows the 
addition/removal/update of &quot;principals&quot; from those groups. This system 
is likely embodied in a server that then is accessed by the several 
interested components (regions and other clients) to perform several 
group-related actions like communication and access control.

The administrative interactions with the group service 
(add/remove/update) can be done in several manners. One of them is via 
the raw LL viewer, with the LL viewer floaties. But that's not the only 
way -- it can be done via the regular web, too. Just think of a service 
similar to what you use for osgrid account access.

</I>&gt;<i> Whatever the group system is, just please keep it separate from region 
</I>&gt;<i> servers at a healthy distance. I would go as far as suggesting that 
</I>&gt;<i> the administration actions in groups should not be accessible via the 
</I>&gt;<i> raw LL viewer because it is a recipe for entanglement. Have all that 
</I>&gt;<i> administrative work done via web/http, which then other viewers can 
</I>&gt;<i> integrate back if they want.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Sure - but unless you have a scalable and robust load balanced topology as
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> e.g. notes/domino, you can avaoid some trouble by having an advance.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The trouble to avoid is enumeration.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Lindens did a &quot;one fits all&quot; group thing.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> While security groups are ACL based, they still need some kinda enumartion.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> So, at the time people had more and more groups and more and more members
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> have been in that group and sending group IM&#180;s, the system degraded.   If
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> this would have been limited to communication it would have been discomfort
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> - but getting the enumeration in groups getting stale, so influence in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> collaboration, it was a pain in the neck.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The advantage would be the goal Charles did outline:  move on to the next
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> frontier.   You could keep compatibility on one (security) while setting up
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> a more advanced (maybe XMPP, wich could be a voice basis as well) solution
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> for the other
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  (communication).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Besides that - yes, collaboration needs communication.  Call me old style -
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I still prefer to be able to access files, portals and print over email
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> @work.  I can still pick up the headset.   So I would prefer to isolate the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> communication from security for availability means, as well.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> i would argue that we first of all need a proper group system, then we can make
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> use of the group system for various other purposes, such as access control,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> modification rights, communication purposes.
