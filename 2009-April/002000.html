<PRE>Hello everyone,

I'm known as Doeko Cassidy in Second Life and used to run SLNN (Second Life
News Network) which is no longer around and I own Crystal Islands, a
mid-sized estate there. In RL I'm known as Jules Vos and I study at the New
Business School in Amsterdam.

I'm currently working as the founder at www.visibuild3d.com, one of the
early real startups based on realXtend/Opensim technology. We were featured
at The Next Web Rising Sun Startup Rally last friday, had a booth and got to
present our message to a large audience.
<A HREF="http://2009.thenextweb.com/finalists/.">http://2009.thenextweb.com/finalists/.</A> Our idea and business concept are
already starting to show some traction in the real world.

We have brought a stable and running modrex region online and I'd like to
invite all of you to come and test things out, so that we can identify the
bugs and get these reports to the REX team. Please go here for more info:
<A HREF="http://visibuild3d.com/news/publicalpha/">http://visibuild3d.com/news/publicalpha/</A>

The goals of Visibuild are:
1) Create a stable and scalable hosting environment for modrex (partially
accomplished)
2) Contribute one or multiple devs to the development of modrex and rex-NG
3) Develop additional tools that will make modrex and rex-NG more usable for
architectural applications
4) Identify related use cases for this software and promote the use
of modrex/Visibuild in these cases (partially accomplished)
5) Secure more funding through revenue and/or grants to make all
this happen

We are currently working on communicating the value of this platform to the
architectural community. We also have some ties with foundations that fund
the open-source movement. Ideally, they would provide a portion of the
funding, however there are currently no developers (C++/C# &amp; OGRE3d)
officially affiliated with Visibuild. This must be accomplished first to
secure funding. Therefore, I'd like to ask unaffiliated devs who are
involved currently with developing modrex or rex-NG and are interested in
the concept of Visibuild to contact me. It may be possible to secure funding
for the project this way.

I'm very interested in hearing your feedback on Visibuild and what we aim to
accomplish. Feel free to follow @visibuild on twitter as well!

Regards,

Jules Vos
