<PRE>You Missed one point too:

Did you paid any developpers ?
Did you ever thanks them for all the hours spending coding ?

Think about that first before having any attitudes.

</I>&gt;<i> Gentlemen, you are utterly missing the point. When we decided to try
</I>&gt;<i> out Opensim (trunk, bleeding edge) it was in the hope that our usage
</I>&gt;<i> might help uncover problems. We made this decision with the full and
</I>&gt;<i> concious knowledge that trunk could break due to: (1) unanticipated
</I>&gt;<i> interaction among modules, (2) simultaneous incompatible changes to
</I>&gt;<i> different modules (3) well-intentioned changes that break something,
</I>&gt;<i> or (4) programmer carelessness, fatigue, sleeplessness, whatever. For
</I>&gt;<i> each of these contingencies we have procedures in place. We can (and
</I>&gt;<i> often do) fall back to prior releases within minutes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But we did not and cannot anticipate deliberate vandalism by a trusted
</I>&gt;<i> developer. Reverting to prior releases cannot work in such cases
</I>&gt;<i> because the time-bomb might have been planted weeks, months, even
</I>&gt;<i> years ago.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I understand that some of you kind and dedicated folks simply cannot
</I>&gt;<i> grasp the difference between accidental (and revertable) breakage on
</I>&gt;<i> the one hand, and a deliberately planted (and unrevertable) time-bomb
</I>&gt;<i> on the other. If most of Opensim's developers also cannot grasp this
</I>&gt;<i> difference, then I assure you that the project is doomed in the real
</I>&gt;<i> world.
