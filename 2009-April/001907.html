<PRE>I asure you this is not a &quot;joke&quot;.  We are absolutely deadly serious.  We
will prosecute this criminal act of malicious code to the fullest extent
of Federal, National, and International law.

  I rarely post here, but I really, really, really hope that your post
  is a joke trying to wrap this up.

  If not, please do us all a favor and take a long nap, count to 10, or
  whatever you need to do to get a grip on reality.

  Look in the mirror and ask yourself: was this really a big deal? No,
  it was a fun little prank in alpha software on a day that many
  developers pull pranks. Pranks were pulled on Wikipedia, Google, and
  many, many other places. Perhaps you should get the FBI and lawyers
  on them too.

  Though I doubt the veracity of this story; every attorney I know
  would quite rightly laugh at you trying to prosecute such a
  ridiculous, minor, harmless prank. If you lost your funding over
  something this irrelevant in alpha code, then tell your funders to
  get a life as well.

  My two cents.

  Regards,

  -Tim

    NO, this will NEVER &quot;go away&quot;!

    I spent all of yesterday with the FBI and my lawyers to make sure
    that the criminals responsible will be hunted down, convicted,
    sent to prison and that they will pay for the financial damages
    they inflicted.

    The deliberate inclusion of intentionally malicious timebomb code
    attacks are a violation of federal law in the US, a violation of
    National law thruout Europe, and a violation of International law
    in every country in the western hemisphere and most of Asia.  The
    Type or cost of the software is legally irrelevant - the
    malicious code is a crime, the knowing intentional distribution
    is a crime.  Claiming the murder victum should have stayed home
    is no defence - murder is a crime.

    Also - the developers who created or knowingly allowed the
    deliberately malicious timebomb code attack designed to disrupt
    systems to be included - must be expelled from the OpenSim
    community in TOTAL DISHONOR AND DISGRACE.  They have destroyed
    the credibility of OpenSim and damaged the reputation of Open
    Source projects in general.
    Those criminal developers are dishonest, unethical, totally
    unprofessional, completely disgusting Assholes.
