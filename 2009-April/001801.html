</I>&gt;<i> It's a marvellous effect, and we did have a laugh about it last night while
</I>&gt;<i> doing a tour with a potential client (discovered the server we were on at
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> time was set to the wrong
</I>&gt;<i>  timezone, hence the early appearance). But it
</I>&gt;<i> wasn't just stick avatars, several folks Hippos crashed out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There's a bit of an issue that I don't believe many core testers use
</I>&gt;<i> MSSQL, hence I can't trust that what one person tags as stable will be
</I>&gt;<i> stable for me. 0.6.1 required an additional patch for MSSQL because there
</I>&gt;<i> were
</I>&gt;<i> fundamental core changes that had happened between 0.6.0 and 0.6.1. Since
</I>&gt;<i> having
</I>&gt;<i> experienced that problem (before we formally launched our grid) I&#8217;ve run
</I>&gt;<i> with
</I>&gt;<i> my own tests and procedures. I've got a big test plan and did two weeks of
</I>&gt;<i> testing before upgrading. I like using MSSQL, it's what I'm familiar
</I>&gt;<i> with, I'm not switching, I believe it's a great platform for OpenSim (as
</I>&gt;<i> proved by ReactionGrid now over 100 regions), and I want to help improve it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is the first Open Source project I've ever worked with, and I
</I>&gt;<i> didn't start looking at it til May last year - I had no clue that this
</I>&gt;<i>  was
</I>&gt;<i> coming and was caught very much off-guard this morning. Seriously, I'd woken
</I>&gt;<i> up thinking how glad I was that I didn't have to reboot all the servers
</I>&gt;<i> every morning since the upgrade, relaxed that I could reclaim an extra 20-30
</I>&gt;<i> mins a day from that improvement alone, and that's all thanks to the great
</I>&gt;<i> stuff you guys have been doing. I'm very sorry if I have offended anyone
</I>&gt;<i> with my response. It didn't take a massive amount of time to fix, a couple
</I>&gt;<i> of hours before most Gridizens woke up, and I am very grateful for Teravus's
</I>&gt;<i> help over IRC in getting a patch together that worked on rev 8831. Yes, I
</I>&gt;<i> should
</I>&gt;<i> have stuck to the RC, but I saw some great bug fixes going into trunk in the
</I>&gt;<i> week after that initial tag was made that made the whole idea of upgrading a
</I>&gt;<i> teeny bit further quite appealing. And again I speak in my own defence - I
</I>&gt;<i> did
</I>&gt;<i> test, test, and test again and I can say that apart from this
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;feature&quot;, 8831 is
</I>&gt;<i>  working out really well for us! I would rather not
</I>&gt;<i> be so far off trunk that our grid can be of little help to the main OpenSim
</I>&gt;<i> development process. One example is the Sloodle to OpenSim port that has
</I>&gt;<i> been
</I>&gt;<i> worked on in both OSGrid and ReactionGrid. We at ReactionGrid want to be
</I>&gt;<i> part of
</I>&gt;<i> those sorts of projects that directly lead to core code improvements if
</I>&gt;<i> possible, and are willing to shoulder some risk in order to help with that.

</I>&gt;<i> This is a very funny joke - I love the long tentacled avatars.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, I can appreciate your frustration, Chris.  I think that it's
</I>&gt;<i> unfortunate that 0.6.3 suffers from an avatar
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> appearance regression that hasn't been addressed.  That's not to
</I>&gt;<i> disrespect the efforts of Charles, Stefan and other
</I>&gt;<i> folk who manage the releases.  They do a fine job, though I think the would
</I>&gt;<i> also agree that our releases are still more
</I>&gt;<i> or less finger in the air, does this seem stable? affairs (though perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> Stefan is trying to change this by doing
</I>&gt;<i> release candidates).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To some extent I think it's a manpower problem.  Until there is a really
</I>&gt;<i> great desire for stable releases as opposed to
</I>&gt;<i> trunk snapshots, then the effort won't go in to assuring this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Having said that, I think that it's unfortunate if some fun code crept into
</I>&gt;<i> a 0.6.4 release candidate - perhaps it
</I>&gt;<i> should be put in a little nearer April 1.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> BTW: Just so people know, I believe the 0.6.4RC that Stefan tagged also

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Given that 0.6.3 was not a good release (avatar appearance bugs), I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     was hoping to wait for 0.6.4 for ReactionGrid and for our clients.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     It was taking a while to tag, and I had identified a stable revision
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     that I had put through a lot of testing and made the call based on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     running a significant test plan. Our database (MSSQL) was over 5Gb,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     the change from 0.6.2 to 0.6.4 included a major schema change that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     meant the longer we left updating, the longer (and harder) an update
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     was gonna be. I made the call to update us just before Stefan tagged
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     the release &#8211; I didn&#8217;t anticipate this particular outcome.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     I will take full responsibility if there is a bug in opensim code
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     that
</I>&gt;<i>  affects my clients that would have been prevented if I had used
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     a stable branch, but I do actually trust you guys too &#8211; you do
</I>&gt;<i> great
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     work, I read every commit log (evidently not thoroughly enough) and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     I use my experience to make a call on whether a breaking change has
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     been put in or not. In this situation, what would have been nice
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     would have been a simple switch to return to normal. We saw the joke
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     last night and yes, we fell about laughing, thinking it was a freaky
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     occurrence on a highly-loaded sim, never for one moment realising
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     this was going to strike all our servers today.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     ReactionGrid is a young business, we&#8217;re pushing out there to find
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     customers who are willing to go with us through the bumps, ride the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     fun little features, because we really do believe in the platform,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    even at this early stage. I didn&#8217;t start working with OpenSim til
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     May last year, so I didn&#8217;t know this was likely to happen.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     I understand that it has caused you problems and we are sorry for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     that but to be honest, its not a good idea to be running trunk in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     any production set up or for business use. Trunk is for development
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     and can be broke at any time.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     We do release &quot;stable&quot; tagged versions and we strongly
</I>&gt;<i> suggest that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     anyone using opensim for business or
</I>&gt;<i>  production use sticks to those.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     They all have their problems but trunk just can't be depended on
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     be working/stable or anything.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     The only people who should be using trunk are developers, testers
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     and people who want to try the very lastest changes.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     All the developers work very hard for nothing in return so its a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     small thing for some of us to put a small pank in TRUNK once a year.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Again I do understand it has caused you some problems but we offer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     all our work free and as I said we strongly advise people to use the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     tagged versions.
