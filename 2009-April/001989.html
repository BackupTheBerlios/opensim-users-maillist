<PRE>&quot;..it's where our skillsets lie..&quot;

Isn&#180;t that the whole story ?

One should work where the skills are - for productive work.

Maybe you can work where you have no skills - to learn.


But if one is offering products or services for free, and one else does not
like that for some reason:  just choose something else or rebuild it like
you like it.

As well:  if someone want&#180;s to run a productive environment, she/he should
choose something having skills on (from a security perspective which
includes availability).


Always interesting discussions...   :-)

The three owners of ReactionGrid, myself, Kyle and Robin Gomboy, are not
employed by Microsoft, but we have good contacts and relations with
several Microsoft employees. Our background is that we have run the .NET
user group and the TechNet group on Microsoft Island on Second Life for
the past 18 months or so as unpaid volunteers, and we started looking at
OpenSim a year ago after some less-than-desirable experiences on the LL
grid when running an event.

 

We run our grid, ReactionGrid, on MS software because it is a platform
we are comfortable with and believe in and it's where our skillsets lie
(I've been a developer for over 10 years almost exclusively on the
Microsoft platform). ReactionGrid is not owned by Microsoft, they have
some sims on our grid, and they pay for an island on the LL grid that we
look after as volunteers for the community. 

 

As for GNU vs BSD, I'm not even starting to get involved. If you don't
like .NET, fine, other platforms are available.
