As this is specifically alpha still, I don't think any of those tag
names are appropriately cautious enough, lest someone misinterpret those.

I think having releases and trunk is the right way to go about it.
There are ways to retarget an svn tree, and if someone wants to make
scripts that do that for users, that's cool.  But I don't think we
should make the release process have more steps, or have tag names
moving out from under people, as that's likely to just cause new issues.
