<PRE>Alrighty, I filed a mantis here 
<A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=5840">http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=5840</A>

As a side note, I have been noticing that if the bug is going to 
trigger, then after a successful teleport scripted attachments will 
randomly decide not load their scripts after TP no matter how long I 
wait. Then if I attempt a teleport/region cross again before the scripts 
have loaded it will trigger the bug.

Not sure if it makes a difference but these are the script related 
settings I made in OpenSim.ini

AllowScriptCrossing = true
TrustBinaries = true
ScriptDelayFactor = 0.0
DeleteScriptsOnStartup = false

Thanks Justin!
