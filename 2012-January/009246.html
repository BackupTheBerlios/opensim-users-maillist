<PRE>Hi Opensimmers and Justin Clark-Casey,

My name is Peter Blair and I've emailed in the past about some of the
limits of standalone regions. In the past tests we've identified about
18-20 avs as the limit of a standalone server running 4 regions in
OpenSim 0.7.2.rc2 on a Intel Core i7 @ 2.8 GHz, 12 GB RAM, and a 526
GB hard drive. These avs were all on the same region.

We've since changed our server to grid mode Opensim 0.7.2.release.
Robust.exe runs on one box with three regions (Intel i7 2600K 16 gig
RAM) and another box is running an additional two regions (Intel Core
i7 @ 2.8 GHz, 12 GB RAM). I'm hoping to get 45 avatars into this grid
mode across the five regions. Accordingly, each of the five regions
would be housing about 10 avatars.

I'm trying to do some preliminary load testing with users but wanted
to ask if anyone has had experience getting this many avs into their
sims, grid or stand alone and what their specs were. Also if I don't
have the needed users to test the sim what other strategies have
other's used to do load testing? I'm assuming one bottle neck that
we've encountered is with the avs requesting textures and such from
the server. Is that the case?

As always, thanks for your help.

Peter
