<PRE>Hi,

as an enthusiastic builder I can say that building in OpenSim is rather  
straightforward for me, and I find the in-world building tools extremely  
easy to use and pretty useful. I'm partly using blender for external  
creation of meshes/sculpts, and partly inworld tools for prim building,  
but I can understand that it's overwhelming for beginners. When I started  
building, I just took it one step at a time, and tried to master the  
inworld tools first, and later blender and other 3D modeling applications.  
It helped immensely just examining other people's builds and how they were  
made. It's one of the reasons I started opensim-creations.com, to give a  
good resource for others interested in building, so maybe it'll be helpful  
for you, too.

&gt;<i> Hallo Buddies,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How things are going with you? I'm still struggling with 3D object
</I>&gt;<i> construction in OpenSim. I just wanted to implement some simple demo for
</I>&gt;<i> exhibition purpose, but I find it's really time-consuming. Is it because
</I>&gt;<i> that I am not experienced enough? Or it's just as it is?  Any tips?  
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Han
