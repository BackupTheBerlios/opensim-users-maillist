<PRE>I've been using the Exodus Viewer (<A HREF="http://exodusviewer.com/">http://exodusviewer.com/</A>) for a couple  
of months now, which is based on the official Viewer 3 of SL, but adds  
some nice features like client-side AO and some customization of the UI.  
Overall, most Third-Party viewers aren't aware of or ignore OpenSim  
completely, and Kokua development seems to be taking its time, so I don't  
think any specific OpenSim features (like LightShare) have made it into  
any V3-based viewer.

Last year, Lee of Kirsten's Viewer put forth a crowdfunding pitch of  
25.000&#163; for one year of viewer development, where the contributors could  
vote on specific features they would like to see in his viewer, which  
would've been a good chance to get an OpenSim-specific V3-based viewer.  
Sadly, the pitch didn't reach its goal, so his viewer development has come  
to a halt as well.

So for now, the bottom line is either the regular SL-viewer (which works  
surprisingly well with OpenSim), Exodus, or Firestorm, as most other  
viewers seem to be not in a very stable development and/or just run by one  
person.


&gt;<i> Hi there,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since a long time I am using the Imprudence viewer because it was closely
</I>&gt;<i> following OpenSim development, but its seems to be less active now.
</I>&gt;<i> Do you know of any other viewer that supports Meshes and Shared Media and
</I>&gt;<i> that is stable enough for OpenSim ? And which one would best follow  
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim
</I>&gt;<i> development for a long time ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you very much,
</I>&gt;<i> P. Mint.
</I>
