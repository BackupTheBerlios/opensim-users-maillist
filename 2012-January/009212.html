<PRE>Dear member,

The *Journal of Virtual Worlds Research* (<A HREF="http://jvwresearch.org/">http://jvwresearch.org/</A>) is happy
to announce the call for this &quot;*Managerial and Commercial Applications*&quot;
issue edited by


   - Shu Schiller, Wright State University, USA
   - Brian Mennecke, Iowa State University, USA
   - Fiona Fui-Hoon Nah, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, USA


You can access this call directly through our
website&lt;<A HREF="http://jvwresearch.org/index.php/component/content/article/10-cfps/27">http://jvwresearch.org/index.php/component/content/article/10-cfps/27</A>&gt;
.

The Journal of Virtual Worlds Research (<A HREF="http://www.jvwresearch.org/">http://www.jvwresearch.org/</A>) is an
online, open access academic journal that engages a wide spectrum of
scholarship and welcomes contributions from the many disciplines and
approaches that intersect with virtual worlds research. Virtual worlds
ignite a continuously evolving area of study that spans multiple
disciplines and the JVWR editorial team looks forward to engaging a wide
range of creative and scholarly research.

*Motivation and Scope*
The intriguing potential of virtual worlds has attracted a significant
amount of scholarly work in the business research domain. As much as we
recognize the invaluable contribution made by scholars in this area, we
also see the need for more research that can offer visionary perspectives
to shape the future design and use of virtual worlds. Through the business
lens, virtual worlds are often perceived to be promising yet risky and
exciting yet formidable for the use and management of individual and
collaborative work. Scholars and practitioners are confronted with an
apparent contradiction: on the one hand, the business case for virtual
worlds appears to offer great promise; while on the other hand, the
observed returns and demonstrable successes are often absent or negligible.

This special issue on &#8220;managerial and commercial applications&#8221; of virtual
worlds aims to highlight research that makes a significant and novel
contribution in theory and practice about virtual worlds in the business
domain. We are seeking papers that showcase new directions for research by
examining technical, behavioral, economic, and/or social perspectives of
virtual worlds in organizational and business environments. In particular,
we are interested in papers that enable us to better understand managerial
and organizational issues associated with virtual worlds and how these
environments should be designed, used, and managed for commercial and
managerial purposes to enhance business value. We especially welcome
innovative and creative research that enables our audience to see the new
possibilities offered by the unique affordances of virtual environments.

Authors are invited to submit original scholarly manuscripts that will make
significant contributions to the advancement of our understanding of
managerial and commercial applications as it applies to virtual worlds. We
encourage diverse methodological approaches and welcome both qualitative
and quantitative research studies, as well as theoretical, conceptual, and
empirical studies.

*Possible topics include, but are not limited to:*

   - Novel and innovative design and development of managerial and
   commercial applications of virtual worlds
   - The use, management, and evaluation of virtual worlds in
   organizational settings
   - Individual and group behaviors in virtual worlds that are used for
   business purposes
   - Process and governance of individual and collaborative group behaviors
   and mechanisms in virtual worlds
   - The role of psychological and social attitudes and characteristics on
   behaviors, processes and outcomes in virtual worlds
   - Ethics, privacy, security, and trust issues related to virtual worlds
   in the business domain
   - Intra- and inter-organizational communication and collaboration and
   cultural issues in virtual worlds
   - Business and economic models of virtual worlds
   - Power and political issues related to individual, group,
   organizational, and societal behaviors in virtual worlds
   - Commercial applications and commercialization of virtual worlds
   technologies and environments
