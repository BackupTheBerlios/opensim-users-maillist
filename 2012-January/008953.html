<PRE>When, like with OpenSim, I install software from source on a server I
run, I like to make sure that if somebody finds a security hole that I
need to take care of, I'm going to find out about it.

I don't think there are a lot of recent issues I need to particularly
worry about, but if something does show up, is there a way to be sure
I'll know about it, apart from reading this list diligently? Something
like:
1) A low-traffic announcements e-mail list that I can subscribe to.
2) A page that I can check periodically where I know I'll be able to
find information about security issues, if there are any.

This is how Drupal does it: A newsletter that will send me stuff, and
a page I can check periodically in case I've missed something. (They
also have RSS feeds.)

If not, could we have one?
