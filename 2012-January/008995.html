<PRE>Thanks for the answers Marcel and Chris,

Then when I physically move to my new home, hoping for less then 6 
months.  If all goes well and I get my new high speed cable internet 
connection, this issue might go away.   Storms and a bad phone company 
have killed my connection.  I have unlimited on Great Works Internet.  I 
have unlimited and it isn't the fault of GWI that connections have been 
so bad.  With unlimited and being so far from base I only get 6.06Mbps 
download and 0.68 Mbps upload now.  In Maine a company called Fairpoint 
bought the phone company promising all kinds of improvements.

Instead we got failures, messed up and crossed lines and last time a 
tech from GWI came to see what was wrong he said, the phone lines are 
cracked in places on the pole and some of the copper is exposed and 
showing, and it is turning green in some spots.  Lucky I have a 
connection at all.

For now I wait, and hoping soon it will all be better.

heh, hoping to win powerball one day so I can donate a million to the 
opensimulator.org project.  ;)  Wouldn't some of you programmers love to 
quit your full time jobs to work full time on opensim for more then you 
make now?  Of course with covered health care and such.  Doing something 
you use to volunteer for.  I would have to start my own corp to do it.  
Oh perchance to dream.

Thanks again all.
Your Friend,
InuYasha
