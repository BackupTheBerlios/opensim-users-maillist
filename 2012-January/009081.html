<PRE>Hi all

I wonder if anyone has any ideas on this little (well major for me)
problem I have just come up against.   I have been running regions on my
own grid and osgrid for some time and have not had any problems for a
while.  Recently I moved my hosted regions from an external server to my
own server (which is currently running under Ubuntu 11.04 64bit on a
VMWare server) in order to cut down my costs of the virtual server I was
renting.   

I am now trying to test out some oars I have come across
(LindaKellie.com) and decided to put these on my external server (for
speed of testing reasons) as I still have around 18 days rent on this
server.   I had recently wiped the server so had to reinstall all the
mono etc etc which was no issue.   My problem is now when I start up
opensim it runs fine, have made 8 regions on it and they start up fine.
I can save oars without any problems, but when I try to load an oar in
(any oar) it gives me the error &quot;Absolute URI is too short&quot; .  I have
even had the hosting company reimage my server and I have the same
problem.  

I can load oars just fine on my virtual machine running at home but that
machine is slow to load them and as I just want to look at these and
will discard them after - I wanted the speed of the external.  I have
never come up against this problem, and I cant see anything by googling
it.

If anyone can shed some light on it - something I have missed I am sure
- I would be very grateful.

PS:  This external server is running on Ubuntu 10.04 LTS and I have just
installed mono with apt-get install mono-complete and am using the
latest default setup from osgrid.org

Regards

Tim Gildersleeve
