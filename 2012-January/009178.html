<PRE>As some are aware, development to add working telehubs to OpenSim has 
been progressing the past couple of days. In the beginning, working out 
the packet dialog with the viewer, several bits of data were needed to 
send for the telehub info. These were saved in the database and there 
was a migration to add the fields and an additional table to the 
database to save these. As work progressed, and more eyes were added to 
the effort, it was apparent that we needed to refresh the values each 
time they were used and that saving them was pointless. So, we are 
modifying the database to only save what is needed. Here is the rub - I 
was not aware that by policy we do not do backwards migrations for a 
couple of reasons. So, these previous migrations will need to be handled 
by hand. It is just a matter of logging into the console of your 
database and pasting the script that follows.

This affects MySQL only! Works has not been extended to other database 
engines at this time.


revisions affected:
start: 32d58d6e3e9a0ea1bfa808567d0f64c0652f8a85
end: c36c916342460751d25350b66ffbd7eb0a401c2b


Script ...

BEGIN;
alter table regionsettings drop column TelehubName;
alter table regionsettings drop column TelehubEnabled;
alter table regionsettings drop column TelehubPosX;
alter table regionsettings drop column TelehubPosY;
alter table regionsettings drop column TelehubPosZ;
alter table regionsettings drop column TelehubRotX;
alter table regionsettings drop column TelehubRotY;
alter table regionsettings drop column TelehubRotZ;
alter table regionsettings drop column TelehubRotW;

alter table spawn_points change column PointX Yaw float NOT NULL;
alter table spawn_points change column PointY Pitch float NOT NULL;
alter table spawn_points change column PointZ Distance float NOT NULL;
COMMIT;

your migrations table (of your region store) should look like ...

+----------------+---------+
|<i> name           | version |
</I>+----------------+---------+
|<i> migrations     |       1 |
</I>|<i> UserStore      |       7 |
</I>|<i> GridStore      |       2 |
</I>|<i> LogStore       |       1 |
</I>|<i> InventoryStore |       4 |
</I>|<i> AssetStore     |       6 |
</I>|<i> RegionStore    |      39 |
</I>+----------------+---------+


That should be all that is needed to get things on track for future 
releases. And, as always you can get additional assistance here or in 
IRC @ #opensim or for development questions #opensim-dev.


Thanks for using OpenSimulator!
