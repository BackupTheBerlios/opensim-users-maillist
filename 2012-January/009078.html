<PRE> &gt; Warehouse available. When I import 3D object into SketchUp, it turns 
out to
 &gt; be OK. But when I try to export from SketchUp (via COLLADA format) 
and then
 &gt; import into OpenSim, it doesn't look that way in SketchUp. Instead the 3D
 &gt; object looks in a mess. Anybody know where I missed?

Sorry, don't know specifics of your SketchUp export issue.

But I saw a video from a recent SecondLife event, where the SL speaker 
wasn't liking Google SketchUp for some reason, polygons or some other 
part of it's generated model output.

The speaker was presuming users were using Blender.org as main tool Like 
Sketchup's Warehouse, Blender has BlendSwap.com, a large collection of 
3D models by Blender artist community.

Maybe there was some more info in the video about SketchUp that might 
help your current situation. I can't find URL for this event, maybe 
someone else has it?
