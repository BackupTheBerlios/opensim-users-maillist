<PRE>Hi all,

Had an interesting issue with a user that we imported iar's from another 
grid he had been on. Some of his scripts didn't recognize him, so we 
figured that we would just change every reference to him to his old UUID 
(from the former grid).

It almost worked perfectly, he was able to log in, his inventory worked, 
his friends list worked. The biggest thing that didn't was the grid 
started calling him Unknown User in the profile, though his name on 
screen was correct.

We are now going to purge his account and re-create him and allow him to 
re-import everything, but any idea what was missed?

Thanks,

Kat
