<PRE>Okay, first of all, thanks for the link to blendswap.

Basically, Blender will only export the mesh itself without the textures,  
so you'll need to save the texture map(s) yourself. I *think* I found the  
alligator you mentioned, but for the life of me couldn't export it to a  
dae file that my viewer would be happy with. (Any help with that would be  
very welcome.) However, if you switch to the UV/Image Editor tab in  
blender, you'll find several maps, out of which SKIN-DISP.jpg and  
SKIN-COLOR.jpg are of interest to you. You just need to save and upload  
them separately, then apply them to your mesh object inworld as you would  
with any other object. However, sinde the displacement and color maps  
really need to overlap each other, it would be better to merge them before  
uploading with some image editor. Being the nice person I am, I did that  
for you. Have a skin texture:

&gt;<i> I really like the mesh models on Blendswap.com [and I think it was Lee  
</I>&gt;<i> (and
</I>&gt;<i> others) that provided this site tip -- thank you!].  In turn, I  
</I>&gt;<i> downloaded
</I>&gt;<i> an alligator (in a blender file format), uploaded the mesh into Blender  
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> then exported the file as a dae file, and uploaded the mesh (using the
</I>&gt;<i> Phoenix Firestorm viewer) into OpenSim.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Still, while all of the above worked like a charm (and I clicked on the  
</I>&gt;<i> box
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;upload texture&quot; when I uploaded the model in the OS), I lost the  
</I>&gt;<i> texture.
</I>&gt;<i> That is, my alligator has a perfect shape but has a blank texture.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any tips on uploading the texture with the mesh model?  That is, the
</I>&gt;<i> alligator's texture was visible when the model was open in Blender.  Did  
</I>&gt;<i> I
</I>&gt;<i> lose the texture on the export out of Blender or during the upload into  
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> OS?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best,
</I>&gt;<i> Kay
