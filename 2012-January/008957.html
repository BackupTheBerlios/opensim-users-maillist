<PRE>In the long term I think that this is a good idea, but at the moment I don't think that there is enough developer 
resource/interest yet to create a separate list or page.

OpenSim shouldn't be subject to classic C issues such as buffer overruns since it runs within a virtual machine 
(.NET/Mono) if that's what you're worried about.  Vulnerabilities in the VM would belong to these projects rather than 
OpenSim.  Of course, there's still the possibility of security issues within the OpenSim system itself (e.g. 
unauthorized deletion of prims).

I'm afraid that the solution for now for security issues is to watch these lists, perhaps external blogs and the commit 
messages/mailing list if you're really worried about internal OpenSim system issues.
