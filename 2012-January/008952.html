<PRE>Hi Justin,

This isn't a recent issue that I can tell. It has been happening for me 
at least since the release of 0.7.1. After commit 
469955889ed5499ed1dbb8fcc224d6912c651d06 it seemed to trigger for me a 
bit more often than before. Before the commit I would get this maybe 
once or twice a day, after the commit I noticed I would get it at least 
twice, sometimes as often as 3, 4 times, or more.

It seems to happen at random and I can't quite pinpoint what I'm doing 
to cause this reaction, but, I suspect having scripts in my attachments 
might have something to do with it as I seem to have less trouble 
crossing with no attachments. That is just my educated guess though :)

This is running a 9 region standalone and not connected to OSGrid.

Thank you!
