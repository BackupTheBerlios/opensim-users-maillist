<PRE>Thanks Mic

 

I have downgraded the osgrid build of my test regions to the same as the
one I run on my other servers (they were only downloaded a few days
apart but I guess that can make the difference).   I want to use the
osgrid as its less hassle getting it up and running just for testing
something - I guess it must be a bit out of date and have that issue.  I
will look again in a few days and see if they have replaced it with the
new version.

 

Just goes to show that my normal practice of moving existing versions to
another directory and then installing the new one and copying over
settings is the safest way - as there is always the old version to go
back to.  Couldn't do this on this occasion as I had wiped the server
doh!

 

Thanks again.

 

Tim

There was an issue with one of the RegionReady posts not checking for a
destination URI. That particular problem showed up in OAR and IAR failed
loads with the &quot;URI too short&quot; message. That problem was fixed in
opensim master late last week.

Hi all

I wonder if anyone has any ideas on this little (well major for me)
problem I have just come up against.   I have been running regions on my
own grid and osgrid for some time and have not had any problems for a
while.  Recently I moved my hosted regions from an external server to my
own server (which is currently running under Ubuntu 11.04 64bit on a
VMWare server) in order to cut down my costs of the virtual server I was
renting.

I am now trying to test out some oars I have come across
(LindaKellie.com) and decided to put these on my external server (for
speed of testing reasons) as I still have around 18 days rent on this
server.   I had recently wiped the server so had to reinstall all the
mono etc etc which was no issue.   My problem is now when I start up
opensim it runs fine, have made 8 regions on it and they start up fine.
I can save oars without any problems, but when I try to load an oar in
(any oar) it gives me the error &quot;Absolute URI is too short&quot; .  I have
even had the hosting company reimage my server and I have the same
problem.

I can load oars just fine on my virtual machine running at home but that
machine is slow to load them and as I just want to look at these and
will discard them after - I wanted the speed of the external.  I have
never come up against this problem, and I cant see anything by googling
it.

If anyone can shed some light on it - something I have missed I am sure
- I would be very grateful.

PS:  This external server is running on Ubuntu 10.04 LTS and I have just
installed mono with apt-get install mono-complete and am using the
latest default setup from osgrid.org

Regards

Tim Gildersleeve
