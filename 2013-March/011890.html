<PRE>Hello all, I am running commit 464201 (r/22383) and am running across 
some very weird attachment issues. At first glance it seems like 
multiple attachment points is now working; it seems to let me attach 
more than one thing to any one attach spot. But it doesn't really behave 
like multiple attachments on SL, such as &quot;Wear&quot; won't replace what ever 
is on the attach point and more or less acts like &quot;Add&quot;, relogging with 
multiple attachments on one point causes one or more of the attachments 
to appear invisible but inventory still thinks they are attached, and 
&quot;floating&quot; attachments (Attachments look like they are rezzed in world 
and they don't move with your avatar when your avatar moves, but it is 
technically attached to your avatar).

I looked back in the commits for the past few weeks to see if there was 
any mention of multiple attach points being implemented but I could not 
find any such commit.  So I tracked down the issue to first appear in 
commit ccd6f4 (r/22294). I haven't made a mantis because I was unsure if 
this was intentional or not.

Is anyone else seeing this?
