<PRE>Hi,

the feature cannot be disabled because the old code path doesn't
exist anymore. There have been a lot of changes besides the multi
attach code. Avination runs the multi attach code without any
issues, indicating that the problems you're seeing are probably
elsewhere.

&gt;<i> Hi Justin, I tested out commit a7a9a8a and the attachments seem to

</I>&gt;<i> 397379, and replace (wear) seems to work properly here as well, although 
</I>&gt;<i> the other weird attachment issues are back again.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Among some of the things I've noticed is:
</I>&gt;<i> * Some attachments refuse to attach on login and will refuse to attach 
</I>&gt;<i> manually via inventory. Relogging sometimes alleviates the issue as well 
</I>&gt;<i> as teleporting or crossing to another region. Sometimes it doesn't.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * The least recently attached object (if using multiple attachments on 
</I>&gt;<i> one point) tends to show up invisible on relog although in inventory it 
</I>&gt;<i> appears to be attached.  The invisible attachments can be detached 
</I>&gt;<i> through the inventory and usually they can be reattached and they show 
</I>&gt;<i> up. On occasion a relog is necessary to continue attaching objects on 
</I>&gt;<i> that particular spot.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Attachments tend to show up &quot;floating&quot; in world (usually on login). 
</I>&gt;<i> That is, they look as if they've been rezzed in world and won't move 
</I>&gt;<i> around with your avatar, but the inventory says they are actually 
</I>&gt;<i> attached. They can be detached normally either through inventory or by 
</I>&gt;<i> right clicking the floating object and detach.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Animations tend to get stuck on region cross when using an AO and can 
</I>&gt;<i> only be fixed with a AO reset or reattach.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Attachment contents sometimes have their permissions changed upon 
</I>&gt;<i> login, teleport, or region cross; even though i have 
</I>&gt;<i> serverside_object_permissions = false set in OpenSim.ini (I usually see 
</I>&gt;<i> this in combination with the stuck animation issue on region cross. The 
</I>&gt;<i> AO's scripts appear to have their permissions changed to no copy/no mod. 
</I>&gt;<i> Upon detach and reattach the permissions are full perm again)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Region crosses / TP's sometimes fail with either an eternal walk/run 
</I>&gt;<i> past the sim border or a never ending TP progress screen. If this 
</I>&gt;<i> happens the only way to fix it is to relog. Upon relog I get several 
</I>&gt;<i> strange error messages in the viewer saying &quot;Could not upload &lt;random 
</I>&gt;<i> UUID here&gt; due to invalid login credentials&quot; before I make it in world. 
</I>&gt;<i> Once in world I'm missing a lot of attachments (just not detached to my 
</I>&gt;<i> avatar not missing from inventory) and the adjacent regions around me 
</I>&gt;<i> look unloaded (looks like there is a huge hole in the center of the 
</I>&gt;<i> region). On a second relog, my attachments are attached again but all 
</I>&gt;<i> the adjacent regions are missing even though I can see them on the map. 
</I>&gt;<i> I can't teleport or cross over to them however. Relogging does not seem 
</I>&gt;<i> to fix the issue if it has been triggered. The only way that I've seen 
</I>&gt;<i> to fix the issue is to restart the OpenSim but I have to forcibly 
</I>&gt;<i> terminate it because running quit will cause the process to hang once it 
</I>&gt;<i> reaches the end of the shutdown routine. I also keep receiving 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;2013-03-18 21:40:44,843 WARN  - OpenSim.Region.Framework.Scenes.Scene 
</I>&gt;<i> [SCENE]: Existing root scene presence detected for Test User 
</I>&gt;<i> 4462532a-0742-4528-870a-11b63ae40079 in Test Region 2 when connecting.  
</I>&gt;<i> Removing existing presence.&quot; when the issue has been triggered and I 
</I>&gt;<i> attempt to relog or cross/TP to other regions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> These are the most common issues I've seen and they seem to show up 
</I>&gt;<i> regardless of whether the attachment is scripted or not but it seems 
</I>&gt;<i> like it happens a bit more frequently with scripted attachments.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is there a way to disable the recent multi attachment code via 
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim.ini to make it revert back to the old attachment behavior for 
</I>&gt;<i> now until the issues are worked out? Or would it be better for me to 
</I>&gt;<i> stick with commit a7a9a8a for now?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you!

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I actually did have multiple attachments near to completion in a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> separate multiple-attachments branch of the OpenSimulator git 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> repository but just haven't had the time to finish and check it as of

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I looked back in the commits for the past few weeks to see if there

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> intentional or not.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Is anyone else seeing this?
