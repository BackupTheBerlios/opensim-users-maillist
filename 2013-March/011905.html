<PRE>Hi Chris.  Whilst working on another topic I have been seeing a few glitches today (e.g. some attachments not always 
being present) but not, it seems, quite to the extent that you're seeing them.

I think the best thing now is if you could open a Mantis and put all the relevant data in there.

Thanks!

</I>&gt;<i> As far as I can tell these bugs do not show up until the very recent introduction of the multi attachment code. (I have
</I>&gt;<i> been testing on commit 3611d33 (r22387) for the past couple hours with several different accounts to verify that they
</I>&gt;<i> don't show up before the multi attach commits). The only exception to this that I could see was the floating attachments
</I>&gt;<i> issue on log in where I had to detach and reattach the effected object(s) to fix it; this seems to be at random (It
</I>&gt;<i> seems to be whatever is attached to left hand most often when I see it; but I have seen cases where other attach points
</I>&gt;<i> exhibit this behavior). I have also tried the tests on a fresh database install as well with the same results. All my
</I>&gt;<i> testing is being done in standalone mode, multi regions, ODE Physics, and Windows x64 .NET (Locally, not on OSGrid)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The animations, perms, and region cross issues I also do not see until attempting to use the commits with multi
</I>&gt;<i> attachments enabled.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I definitely can not say that I know for sure that the multi attachment code is what is causing these issues; but just
</I>&gt;<i> trying to give a narrowed down area of when I first started noticing them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As far as teleporting to and from in HG mode, I can't say because I don't have experience (yet) with HG.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I gave commit 8de933 a quick test and was still able to trigger most of the issues previously posted. The invisible
</I>&gt;<i> attachment on log in issue was the only one that I did not see pop up in my test but I'm not 100% certain that it is gone.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Have also observed the touch event issue with attachments not working until reattach; but this has been the case (for me
</I>&gt;<i> at least) for a while now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And not a problem; I'm happy to be able to help out with such an awesome project =) I'll stick with a7a9a8a for now on
</I>&gt;<i> my main install and continue testing master in a different database.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Are these all new bugs, Chris?  Certainly, there seem to be issues for me with the new code on my local system (using
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> LL 3.3.4 to test), though Nebadon with Kokua on osgrid didn't seem to have too much trouble yesterday.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Some of the others strike me as more general/existing problems though, such as animation, region cross and permission
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> issues.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have put some fixes for various issues I've encountered into master so you may want to retest.  However, there are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> still some problems. Two I encounter are that all but one of the attachments on a single spot report as being on an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Invalid Attachment Point&quot; after teleport (though they still show up now and appear to be detachable just fine).  The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> other is that editing a script in an attachment to have a touch event does not make that touchable for the viewer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> until the attachment is detached and reattached (that might possibly have been the case before, though I didn't think
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> One of these fixes probably requires osgrid services to update first if you're using that.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> On a more general note, I don't know what the effect is on crossing between simulators which don't have multi-attach
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (e.g. in HG mode). Having said that, Nebadon on osgrid today didn't seem to have much trouble with this.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So you may want to stick with commit a7a9a8a just for now, though I do very much value your feedback on the bleeding
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> edge.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Hi Justin, I tested out commit a7a9a8a and the attachments seem to replace properly again and the issues that I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> mentioned in my previous post seem to be gone as well. I also tested the latest master, commit 397379, and replace
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (wear) seems to work properly here as well, although the other weird attachment issues are back again.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Among some of the things I've noticed is:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> * Some attachments refuse to attach on login and will refuse to attach manually via inventory. Relogging sometimes
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> alleviates the issue as well as teleporting or crossing to another region. Sometimes it doesn't.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> * The least recently attached object (if using multiple attachments on one point) tends to show up invisible on relog
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> although in inventory it appears to be attached.  The invisible attachments can be detached through the inventory and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> usually they can be reattached and they show up. On occasion a relog is necessary to continue attaching objects on that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> particular spot.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> * Attachments tend to show up &quot;floating&quot; in world (usually on login). That is, they look as if they've been rezzed in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> world and won't move around with your avatar, but the inventory says they are actually attached. They can be detached
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> normally either through inventory or by right clicking the floating object and detach.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> * Animations tend to get stuck on region cross when using an AO and can only be fixed with a AO reset or reattach.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> * Attachment contents sometimes have their permissions changed upon login, teleport, or region cross; even though i have
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> serverside_object_permissions = false set in OpenSim.ini (I usually see this in combination with the stuck animation
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> issue on region cross. The AO's scripts appear to have their permissions changed to no copy/no mod. Upon detach and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> reattach the permissions are full perm again)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> * Region crosses / TP's sometimes fail with either an eternal walk/run past the sim border or a never ending TP progress
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> screen. If this happens the only way to fix it is to relog. Upon relog I get several strange error messages in the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> viewer saying &quot;Could not upload &lt;random UUID here&gt; due to invalid login credentials&quot; before I make it in world. Once in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> world I'm missing a lot of attachments (just not detached to my avatar not missing from inventory) and the adjacent
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> regions around me look unloaded (looks like there is a huge hole in the center of the region). On a second relog, my
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> attachments are attached again but all the adjacent regions are missing even though I can see them on the map. I can't
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> teleport or cross over to them however. Relogging does not seem to fix the issue if it has been triggered. The only way
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that I've seen to fix the issue is to restart the OpenSim but I have to forcibly terminate it because running quit will
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> cause the process to hang once it reaches the end of the shutdown routine. I also keep receiving &quot;2013-03-18
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 21:40:44,843 WARN  - OpenSim.Region.Framework.Scenes.Scene [SCENE]: Existing root scene presence detected for Test User
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 4462532a-0742-4528-870a-11b63ae40079 in Test Region 2 when connecting. Removing existing presence.&quot; when the issue has
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> been triggered and I attempt to relog or cross/TP to other regions.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> These are the most common issues I've seen and they seem to show up regardless of whether the attachment is scripted or
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> not but it seems like it happens a bit more frequently with scripted attachments.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Is there a way to disable the recent multi attachment code via OpenSim.ini to make it revert back to the old attachment
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> behavior for now until the issues are worked out? Or would it be better for me to stick with commit a7a9a8a for now?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
