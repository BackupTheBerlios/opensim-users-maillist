<PRE>Hello, everyone. I'm wondering what you use to soundscape your Sim. I'm
still in planning mode for mine, but I was thinking it would be nice to
have area music on a 20-30 second loop in multiple areas. I haven't done
much with media prims, last time I used them I found them to be more of a
hassle and a limitation than I wanted. I was thinking I could script a
&quot;band in a box&quot;by using short loops and lots of timers, but I heard that
OpenSim uses its own timer unit that isn't necessarily as small as I would
need for something like that. Also, timers slow down the Sim by a lot,
iirc.
So then my thought was, why not just change the configuration of the
program to accept sounds in prims that are longer than 10 seconds. I
remember reading a discussion about the pros and cons of it in secondlife,
but that was a long time ago, and I don't remember what was said. Also, I
can't seem to figure out how it would be done. Where is this set at? Would
I have to get my hands dirty with the source, or can I override it with a
config file? Also, can I do it to a preset configuration like diva or soas?

Mostly I'm looking for your experiences. Have you messed with this before?
What have you tried? What worked, or kind of worked, or what should I stay
away from?

Thanks.
