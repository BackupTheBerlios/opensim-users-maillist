<PRE>Thanks Justin and Emperor.. good to know its a problem others have 
seen.  As Justin shows, MOAP is definitely served server direct to 
user like the media URL.

The MOAP URLs all show in the list of media that can &quot;play&quot; in the 
viewer and it gradually fills in from adjacent plots and regions even 
if you never visit them or cross plots.  We have two adjacent regions 
with student project galleries on them next to our main meeting area 
in the corner of one of those regions and we see perhaps 30 to 40 
URLs in the play list.

As Justin said only 5 or so play at once?  Empirically by observation 
I thought I was seeing 5 to 7 at any one time fighting to start up as 
I move my camera around... so Justin might be right at a limit of 5?

Its a real pain as we get a cacophony of youtube video sounds while 
in a seminar on our main meeting space.  You can find all the sources 
with the icon to locate a MOAP generating prim... but to go there and 
turn them all off (even where you do have permissions) took me over 
an hour yesterday!

</I>&gt;<i>In principle it might be possible to get the MOAP module to not 
</I>&gt;<i>serve shared media surfaces to users in other plots but
</I>&gt;<i>this wouldn't work if the avatar was crossing plot lines (since it 
</I>&gt;<i>would already have the data).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I think one would really need the viewer to actively drop MOAP 
</I>&gt;<i>surfaces in other plots (in which case you wouldn't need
</I>&gt;<i>any simulator-side changes).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I would actually be kind of surprised if there isn't a TPV that 
</I>&gt;<i>offers something like this, since MOAP is heavyweight
</I>&gt;<i>and afaik the display limit is 5 surfaces.  But I haven't explored that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>This question actually finally triggered me to create a crude 
</I>&gt;<i>diagram of how MOAP works [1], namely that the
</I>&gt;<i>communication is directly with a website.  But I don't think that 
</I>&gt;<i>actually has anything to do with this question.

</I>&gt;<i>Unfortunately this is not just limited to Media On A Prim in Secondlife.  It
</I>&gt;<i>also extends to sounds i.e. in breedable pets such as horses.  Unfortunately
</I>&gt;<i>as a region manager in Secondlife I get these kinds of complaints but the
</I>&gt;<i>only way I know to correct it is in the script itself.  There is nothing in
</I>&gt;<i>the region manager that can fix that or really in about land.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>As for in opensim I think it's the same thing as I don't recall seeing
</I>&gt;<i>anything in the Opensim.ini file or region.ini files that solves that but I
</I>&gt;<i>could be missing something there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I also recently had to have a couple residents on the region in Secondlife I
</I>&gt;<i>manage both own their parcels and not deed to group.  This seems to help a
</I>&gt;<i>little bit.  Might also try changing the channel your script operates on
</I>&gt;<i>including the ranges in distance the script works in.  It may or may not
</I>&gt;<i>help.
