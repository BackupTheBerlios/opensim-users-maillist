<PRE>just sticking my paw in on this i would just about KILL for a viewer that

1 didn't try to load the entire region of stuff before being able to move
around (a 50 meter sphere would be fine)

2 had a screen that was useable for small devices (my netbook has a
1024*600 screen)

3 was semi current with the LL codebase

4 while im dreaming here hows about a portable install?? (saves all of its
data files in an internal folder)

Any takers?? heck having Gimp/Blender/Sim on a stick/Bad Wolf Viewer as a
single download would be KILLER

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and with SL and OpenSim.   It doesn't do everything now, but releases are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> frequent and seem to be focused on adding features instead of fixing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bugs..  In the Browser space, I have been seeing a lot of people pointing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> at PixieViewer.  I have only taken a cursory look at this option, since I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> am happy with my Android solution.  My impression was that it was a &quot;cool
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thing&quot;  but not really in the realm of a working tool yet.  I have to agree
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with Justin (and others) who see the webGL rendering as a possible future
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> direction but not likely to be a &quot;world changer&quot; in the immediate future.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Personally, I think that there are much more robust web technologies to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;show folks&quot; the inside of a virtual world.  It seems to me that the same
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> amount of effort that you direct at getting user inworld on a web viewer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could be put into developing a sequence of video/web based how-to use a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;real&quot; viewer.   Think of it this way...  do you want someone to see your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sim in a viewer that can render the surrounding 20 meters at a max texture
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> resolution of 256x256,  or would you want to show them a YouTube of your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sim rendered at HD resolution?    Even the Lindens ( who have trouble
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> recognizing customer desires ) have learned that asking new users to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> download a new viewer every time they want a new feature is a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> non-starter.    If someone had shown me a ruth on an island in a web viewer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> when I started,, and i couldn't drop and modify a prim,  I wouldn't have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> spent the last years digging any deeper...  I would have said  OOOO another
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> version of VRML with its disconnected toolsets...    The REAL differnce and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> advantage OpenSim has over any of your alternatives ( like Unity)  is that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you can MODIFY yourself AND what is in the space around you..   I dont see
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> how you will ever accomplish that with a web based UI.
