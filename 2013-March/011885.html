<PRE>Unfortunately this is not just limited to Media On A Prim in Secondlife.  It
also extends to sounds i.e. in breedable pets such as horses.  Unfortunately
as a region manager in Secondlife I get these kinds of complaints but the
only way I know to correct it is in the script itself.  There is nothing in
the region manager that can fix that or really in about land.  

As for in opensim I think it's the same thing as I don't recall seeing
anything in the Opensim.ini file or region.ini files that solves that but I
could be missing something there.

I also recently had to have a couple residents on the region in Secondlife I
manage both own their parcels and not deed to group.  This seems to help a
little bit.  Might also try changing the channel your script operates on
including the  ranges in distance the script works in.  It may or may not
help.

I hope that helps a little bit.

This is really a general Media on a prim query... rather  than being OpenSim
specific, so please excuse the use our of mailing list here... but I thought
I would check what the experience of others here in the OpenSim community
is... as it seems to be a real problem...

We have noticed that on our Virtual University of Edinburgh regions in
Second Life and OpenSim where many students set up MOAP screens in gallery
spaces for their projects that the media playing (often YouTube videos, etc)
appears in the &quot;playing&quot; list in viewers and we get perhaps 30 to 40 ites in
that list which seem to fight to play... 
These leak across into adjacent plots even when play sounds and so on are
limite dto the plots.  But we even notice it can leak across REGION
boundaries in Second Life which seems odd.  It seems that a plot owner
cannot control sound coming INTO their plor or region.

Anyone else noticed this or seen on-line discussion of the best fixes?
