<PRE>Hi Rina,

I've played around a little bit with this myself.  With my situation, I
was looking at more 'nature' type noises,for which there are two tricks
that I use.

For certain noises such as wind that need to play constantly, I just get
the sound that I want to use, and then use llLoopSound to get it going.

For sounds that need to play a little less constantly, like birds
chirping, I use a timer script and then place objects at different places
around the region.  I tend to change the timer length somewhat so that
they're not all using the same interval (so some might trigger at 60
seconds, some at 90 seconds for instance) just to vary things up a little
bit.

Hope this helps.

&gt;<i> Hello, everyone. I'm wondering what you use to soundscape your Sim. I'm
</I>&gt;<i> still in planning mode for mine, but I was thinking it would be nice to
</I>&gt;<i> have area music on a 20-30 second loop in multiple areas. I haven't done
</I>&gt;<i> much with media prims, last time I used them I found them to be more of a
</I>&gt;<i> hassle and a limitation than I wanted. I was thinking I could script a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;band in a box&quot;by using short loops and lots of timers, but I heard that
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim uses its own timer unit that isn't necessarily as small as I would
</I>&gt;<i> need for something like that. Also, timers slow down the Sim by a lot,
</I>&gt;<i> iirc.
</I>&lt;snip&gt;

</PRE>
