<PRE>Hi Justin, I tested out commit a7a9a8a and the attachments seem to 
replace properly again and the issues that I mentioned in my previous 
post seem to be gone as well. I also tested the latest master, commit 
397379, and replace (wear) seems to work properly here as well, although 
the other weird attachment issues are back again.

Among some of the things I've noticed is:
* Some attachments refuse to attach on login and will refuse to attach 
manually via inventory. Relogging sometimes alleviates the issue as well 
as teleporting or crossing to another region. Sometimes it doesn't.

* The least recently attached object (if using multiple attachments on 
one point) tends to show up invisible on relog although in inventory it 
appears to be attached.  The invisible attachments can be detached 
through the inventory and usually they can be reattached and they show 
up. On occasion a relog is necessary to continue attaching objects on 
that particular spot.

* Attachments tend to show up &quot;floating&quot; in world (usually on login). 
That is, they look as if they've been rezzed in world and won't move 
around with your avatar, but the inventory says they are actually 
attached. They can be detached normally either through inventory or by 
right clicking the floating object and detach.

* Animations tend to get stuck on region cross when using an AO and can 
only be fixed with a AO reset or reattach.

* Attachment contents sometimes have their permissions changed upon 
login, teleport, or region cross; even though i have 
serverside_object_permissions = false set in OpenSim.ini (I usually see 
this in combination with the stuck animation issue on region cross. The 
AO's scripts appear to have their permissions changed to no copy/no mod. 
Upon detach and reattach the permissions are full perm again)

* Region crosses / TP's sometimes fail with either an eternal walk/run 
past the sim border or a never ending TP progress screen. If this 
happens the only way to fix it is to relog. Upon relog I get several 
strange error messages in the viewer saying &quot;Could not upload &lt;random 
UUID here&gt; due to invalid login credentials&quot; before I make it in world. 
Once in world I'm missing a lot of attachments (just not detached to my 
avatar not missing from inventory) and the adjacent regions around me 
look unloaded (looks like there is a huge hole in the center of the 
region). On a second relog, my attachments are attached again but all 
the adjacent regions are missing even though I can see them on the map. 
I can't teleport or cross over to them however. Relogging does not seem 
to fix the issue if it has been triggered. The only way that I've seen 
to fix the issue is to restart the OpenSim but I have to forcibly 
terminate it because running quit will cause the process to hang once it 
reaches the end of the shutdown routine. I also keep receiving 
&quot;2013-03-18 21:40:44,843 WARN  - OpenSim.Region.Framework.Scenes.Scene 
[SCENE]: Existing root scene presence detected for Test User 
4462532a-0742-4528-870a-11b63ae40079 in Test Region 2 when connecting.  
Removing existing presence.&quot; when the issue has been triggered and I 
attempt to relog or cross/TP to other regions.

These are the most common issues I've seen and they seem to show up 
regardless of whether the attachment is scripted or not but it seems 
like it happens a bit more frequently with scripted attachments.

Is there a way to disable the recent multi attachment code via 
OpenSim.ini to make it revert back to the old attachment behavior for 
now until the issues are worked out? Or would it be better for me to 
stick with commit a7a9a8a for now?

Thank you!
