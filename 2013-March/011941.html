<PRE>I don't know if this solution fits your needs or not.

When I generate NPC's that need to react with an animation, I've found it
much more reliable to have the collision object broadcast a negative
channel message that the attachment listens for.  I use a hash of the NPC
UUID to determine the broadcast channel,  and  the same Hash to open the
listen channel in the attachment code.   Since I equip all my NPC's with an
AO, I have simply added a section of code to trigger the &quot;reaction&quot;
specified by the object that detected the collision.   I have added an
additional listen channel I have designated as a group channel.  I plan to
use the same strategy ( a hash of the group UUID ) to allow me to send
control message to subsets of the NPC population.

As far as the avatar capsule collison shape goes..   I have been unable to
get any consistent results with detectors at ground/foot level.  Not only
is the capsule smallest there, but when NPC's get off track and bounce off
walls or other NPC's, they seem to &quot;gain altitude&quot;.   I find that they
often loose contact with the ground and stop triggering lower detectors
completely.  In high traffic areas  I try to keep all of the avatar
detectors in a 1 meter range centered around the waist of an &quot;average&quot;
avatar height.  Not only is this where the capsule is normally widest,  but
it is high enough to &quot;grab&quot; the floating NPC's and trigger an
new-direction/animation  that gets them back to the ground.
