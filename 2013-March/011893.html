<PRE>Apologies Chris, I did indeed introduce a regression with that change.  This should be fixed in git master a7a9a8a.

I actually did have multiple attachments near to completion in a separate multiple-attachments branch of the 
OpenSimulator git repository but just haven't had the time to finish and check it as of yet.  Also, the mainline code 
has moved on a bit so it would need updating.

&gt;<i> Hello all, I am running commit 464201 (r/22383) and am running across some very weird attachment issues. At first glance
</I>&gt;<i> it seems like multiple attachment points is now working; it seems to let me attach more than one thing to any one attach
</I>&gt;<i> spot. But it doesn't really behave like multiple attachments on SL, such as &quot;Wear&quot; won't replace what ever is on the
</I>&gt;<i> attach point and more or less acts like &quot;Add&quot;, relogging with multiple attachments on one point causes one or more of
</I>&gt;<i> the attachments to appear invisible but inventory still thinks they are attached, and &quot;floating&quot; attachments
</I>&gt;<i> (Attachments look like they are rezzed in world and they don't move with your avatar when your avatar moves, but it is
</I>&gt;<i> technically attached to your avatar).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I looked back in the commits for the past few weeks to see if there was any mention of multiple attach points being
</I>&gt;<i> implemented but I could not find any such commit.  So I tracked down the issue to first appear in commit ccd6f4
</I>&gt;<i> (r/22294). I haven't made a mantis because I was unsure if this was intentional or not.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is anyone else seeing this?
