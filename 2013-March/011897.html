<PRE>Hi Justin,

As far as I can tell these bugs do not show up until the very recent 
introduction of the multi attachment code. (I have been testing on 
commit 3611d33 (r22387) for the past couple hours with several different 
accounts to verify that they don't show up before the multi attach 
commits). The only exception to this that I could see was the floating 
attachments issue on log in where I had to detach and reattach the 
effected object(s) to fix it; this seems to be at random (It seems to be 
whatever is attached to left hand most often when I see it; but I have 
seen cases where other attach points exhibit this behavior). I have also 
tried the tests on a fresh database install as well with the same 
results. All my testing is being done in standalone mode, multi regions, 
ODE Physics, and Windows x64 .NET (Locally, not on OSGrid)

The animations, perms, and region cross issues I also do not see until 
attempting to use the commits with multi attachments enabled.

I definitely can not say that I know for sure that the multi attachment 
code is what is causing these issues; but just trying to give a narrowed 
down area of when I first started noticing them.

As far as teleporting to and from in HG mode, I can't say because I 
don't have experience (yet) with HG.

I gave commit 8de933 a quick test and was still able to trigger most of 
the issues previously posted. The invisible attachment on log in issue 
was the only one that I did not see pop up in my test but I'm not 100% 
certain that it is gone.

Have also observed the touch event issue with attachments not working 
until reattach; but this has been the case (for me at least) for a while 
now.

And not a problem; I'm happy to be able to help out with such an awesome 
project =) I'll stick with a7a9a8a for now on my main install and 
continue testing master in a different database.

Thank you

</I>&gt;<i> fine).  The other is that editing a script in an attachment to have a 
</I>&gt;<i> touch event does not make that touchable for the viewer until the 
</I>&gt;<i> attachment is detached and reattached (that might possibly have been 
</I>&gt;<i> the case before, though I didn't think so).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One of these fixes probably requires osgrid services to update first 
</I>&gt;<i> if you're using that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On a more general note, I don't know what the effect is on crossing 
</I>&gt;<i> between simulators which don't have multi-attach (e.g. in HG mode).  
</I>&gt;<i> Having said that, Nebadon on osgrid today didn't seem to have much 
</I>&gt;<i> trouble with this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So you may want to stick with commit a7a9a8a just for now, though I do 
</I>&gt;<i> very much value your feedback on the bleeding edge.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi Justin, I tested out commit a7a9a8a and the attachments seem to

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (wear) seems to work properly here as well, although the other weird 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> attachment issues are back again.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Among some of the things I've noticed is:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Some attachments refuse to attach on login and will refuse to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> attach manually via inventory. Relogging sometimes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> alleviates the issue as well as teleporting or crossing to another 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> region. Sometimes it doesn't.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * The least recently attached object (if using multiple attachments 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on one point) tends to show up invisible on relog
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> although in inventory it appears to be attached.  The invisible 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> attachments can be detached through the inventory and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> usually they can be reattached and they show up. On occasion a relog 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is necessary to continue attaching objects on that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> particular spot.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Attachments tend to show up &quot;floating&quot; in world (usually on login). 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That is, they look as if they've been rezzed in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> world and won't move around with your avatar, but the inventory says 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they are actually attached. They can be detached
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> normally either through inventory or by right clicking the floating 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> object and detach.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Animations tend to get stuck on region cross when using an AO and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can only be fixed with a AO reset or reattach.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Attachment contents sometimes have their permissions changed upon 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> login, teleport, or region cross; even though i have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> serverside_object_permissions = false set in OpenSim.ini (I usually 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> see this in combination with the stuck animation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> issue on region cross. The AO's scripts appear to have their 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> permissions changed to no copy/no mod. Upon detach and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reattach the permissions are full perm again)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Region crosses / TP's sometimes fail with either an eternal 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> walk/run past the sim border or a never ending TP progress
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> screen. If this happens the only way to fix it is to relog. Upon 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> relog I get several strange error messages in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> viewer saying &quot;Could not upload &lt;random UUID here&gt; due to invalid 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> login credentials&quot; before I make it in world. Once in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> world I'm missing a lot of attachments (just not detached to my 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> avatar not missing from inventory) and the adjacent
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> regions around me look unloaded (looks like there is a huge hole in 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the center of the region). On a second relog, my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> attachments are attached again but all the adjacent regions are 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> missing even though I can see them on the map. I can't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> teleport or cross over to them however. Relogging does not seem to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fix the issue if it has been triggered. The only way
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that I've seen to fix the issue is to restart the OpenSim but I have 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to forcibly terminate it because running quit will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cause the process to hang once it reaches the end of the shutdown 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> routine. I also keep receiving &quot;2013-03-18
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 21:40:44,843 WARN  - OpenSim.Region.Framework.Scenes.Scene [SCENE]: 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Existing root scene presence detected for Test User
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 4462532a-0742-4528-870a-11b63ae40079 in Test Region 2 when 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> connecting. Removing existing presence.&quot; when the issue has
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> been triggered and I attempt to relog or cross/TP to other regions.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> These are the most common issues I've seen and they seem to show up 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> regardless of whether the attachment is scripted or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not but it seems like it happens a bit more frequently with scripted 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> attachments.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is there a way to disable the recent multi attachment code via 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OpenSim.ini to make it revert back to the old attachment
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> behavior for now until the issues are worked out? Or would it be 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> better for me to stick with commit a7a9a8a for now?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thank you!
