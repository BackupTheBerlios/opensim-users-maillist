It's not about distribution. That is a whole other kettle of fish.

&gt;<i> Whether copying an item I have licensed but not created from the personal

</I>
Transfer from one account to another on the same grid is governed by
the &quot;no copy&quot; permission. Transfer off the grid is not allowed. It
really is that simple but I'm really getting the impression that you
don't want to accept that. I understand you'd like reality to be
different and you'd like users to actually own their inventory
outright but that s simply not the case. Some TOS restrict items to
one grid only and don't allow download of items you have not
yourself created. If you download something you acquired from
someone else in one of those grids, it is theft. No matter what the
purpose of the download is.
