<PRE>I would encourage everyone to try to keep the conversation civil and
respectful.  Heated rhetoric generally helps no one and can quickly derail
honest efforts to communicate about difficult topics.

I interpreted Snowcrash's communications as an effort to dialogue with the
community.  He asked for feedback, he stated repeatedly that his intention
is not to aid content theft, and he said he was open to suggestions for
protecting grid operators' and content creators' rights.  Nothing has been
released yet, so I'm assuming good faith on Snowcrash's part, and hope we
can continue to have that conversation in a polite way.

I'd also point out again that there are many kinds of content creators with
many kinds of intents for our content.  My desire to widely share and
openly license the content I create is as important to me as another
creator's desire to control access to their content is to them.  As I said
before, I often feel that those of us who prefer to open source our content
are in some ways held hostage by the concerns of the latter group, which I
happen to agree with Snowcrash, is to the detriment of the Opensim
community as a whole.

IMO, the goal should be to design systems and tools that give ALL creators
the ability to clearly communicate and attach their intentions/license
terms to assets in a way that is respected and enforced as much as possible
by the Opensim code and through policies and configuration settings
available to grid operators.

I would love to see a tool that aids the portability of _legitimately
licensed_ assets between grids, but unfortunately we're still stuck with
the problem that content creators' intentions and license terms are NOT
attached to existing objects.  If there's no license, I don't see a way to
safely, legally allow the portability of assets from one grid to another en
masse through a tool like this  :(

Respectfully,

- Chris/Fleep

</I>&gt;<i>      Yes,  we need an easier way to load IAR files....
</I>&gt;<i>                      Why don't you implement this as a first step and

</I>&gt;<i>                      (Instead of proclaiming your intent to implement
</I>&gt;<i> something that requires us to react in a publicly negative way)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      Yes,  we probably need to implement some kind of license tagging to
</I>&gt;<i> assets to properly identify those place in the PD BY the creator.
</I>&gt;<i>                     Even so,  I lend my voice to the chorus of  &quot;IANAL
</I>&gt;<i> BUT.... I hope you confer with proper legal counsel before you jump off the
</I>&gt;<i> liability cliff &quot; ....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I hope my response to your request for grid operators to participate in
</I>&gt;<i> this discussion is clear....
</I>&gt;<i>       I will disconnect and ban anyone who attempts to connect to any of
</I>&gt;<i> the grids I administer using this tool.
</I>&gt;<i>       I will publicly identify those users and share all the information I
</I>&gt;<i> am able to collect with all of the operators of any other grid I can
</I>&gt;<i> communicate with .
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Those of us who have been here a while have seen this all before, and I'm
</I>&gt;<i> sure we will see it again.
</I>&gt;<i> The response can only be &quot;We do NOT want your tool as designed,  we WILL
</I>&gt;<i> NOT tolerate its use.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> NO, there are NO valid reasons to welcome a tool that incorporates a
</I>&gt;<i> disregard for an important part of the Opensim community (creators)
</I>&gt;<i> Public pressure was enough to thwart the public release of the last
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;OpenSource sim copy utility&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> I continue to hope that the vocal opposition we expressed as a community
</I>&gt;<i> to that effort is brought to bear here as well..
