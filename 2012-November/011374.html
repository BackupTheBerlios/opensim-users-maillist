<PRE>I have to agree with Diva on this and that is what I would suggest. Give
the grid owners the option and the tools to configure this type of tools
use. My self and Valhalla Virtual would be more at ease with allowing this
tool to be used if such a thing were put in place to which we could
configure properly, then write out exactly whats what regarding exporting
in our TOS based around this configuration.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After I wrote this, I realized that maybe the reason why you did your tool
</I>&gt;<i> the way you did it is because you don't know how to do it in any other way.
</I>&gt;<i> So let me explain what's the &quot;right&quot; way of doing it. (&quot;right&quot; meaning that
</I>&gt;<i> you won't upset anyone; on the contrary, you'll be thanked)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You should develop a robust-bound service that packs and unpacks
</I>&gt;<i> inventory, and that can accomodate a variety of export policies. The tool
</I>&gt;<i> that runs in people's computers would then interact with that piece of
</I>&gt;<i> server-side code directly. It's not hard to do.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Doing it this way, the people who run these services have choices. For
</I>&gt;<i> example, Fleep would likely run that service in FleepGrid using its most
</I>&gt;<i> permissive policy (all items). Melanie would run that service in Avination,
</I>&gt;<i> maybe, using its most strict policy (only items created by the user). Some
</I>&gt;<i> other commercial grids might not run the service at all. When we finally
</I>&gt;<i> have the export flag, that can also be taken into consideration. Etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The way you are doing it, you give grid operators no choice, because
</I>&gt;<i> you're exploiting the viewer channel using libomv hacks. The lack of choice
</I>&gt;<i> upsets people. You're right that you didn't create libomv, and that what
</I>&gt;<i> you did can, indeed, be done by others. I am on the camp of those who think
</I>&gt;<i> that using the viewer channel for accessing grid resources should be done
</I>&gt;<i> only and exactly by person-driven viewers, and that therefore grids should
</I>&gt;<i> refuse service to ALL client bots, even those that are embedded in the
</I>&gt;<i> viewers -- bots are not hard to detect, especially if they want to do
</I>&gt;<i> things as fast as they must. Don't be surprised if you see bot-kicking
</I>&gt;<i> opensim extensions coming soon, rendering your tool (and others') useless.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim is open source and has a great plugin architecture; practically
</I>&gt;<i> everything you can envisioning doing can be done by extending the
</I>&gt;<i> server-side with useful features, which can then be used or not by whoever
</I>&gt;<i> runs these worlds.
