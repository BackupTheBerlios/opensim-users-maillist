Hi Snowcrash.  There is an experimental deduplicating asset service in core called XAssetService [1].  This appears to 
work fine - I haven't had a chance to progress it since I wanted to think through how migration would (or would not) work.

My chief reason for doing this was that I was interested myself in providing an external optional &quot;load iar&quot; mechanism 
which did not rely on client interface operations and did not rely on exposing the internal service port.  I was 
reluctant to provide another avenue for uploading data before some kind of default deduplication was in place.

There is also an assets/&lt;asset-id&gt;/metadata URL available that would return asset ID if one is willing to rely on this. 
  Unfortunately, this is not yet documented.

I'm also interested in providing a license/doc mechanism in IARs/OARs, chiefly so that anybody can add doc a license 
that could be displayed on reloading the IAR/OAR.  Unfortunately, stretching this into the main body of the system 
itself would be considerably more complicated.

I would have to counsel anybody to think very carefully before opening up their internal asset and inventory services. 
As Diva says, it may be better to use the HG gatekeepers to these services though that may involve compromise.

I'm very happy to see experimentation in this field because it's a major issue.  And it's up to individuals to make 
these decisions.  But I would say OpenSimulator itself will remain with default config options very similar to what we 
have now (e.g. no service exposure).

On a final note - it's will be much easier if you make your code BSD/MIT/Apache before releasing for interaction with 
existing codebases with a similar license.  AGPL is a wildly different license.

</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt; Hi
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt; I've been working on a client side tool for decentralizing user
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt; inventories, which I will release as an open source tool in two weeks,
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt; some of the features may be relevant to grid operators.
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt; The basic premise of the tool is that the inventory and the backing
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt; assets of the inventory items really should be controlled by the user.
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt; The tool is born out of a frustration of having visited a number of
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt; grids. Each visit to a new grid presents me with an empty inventory,
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt; and I can then spend time searching for suitable item, clothing,
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt; attachments and other accessories.
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt; For this purpose I have created a tool which will allow me to backup
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt; my inventory to a local cache and then upload the contents to another
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt; grid.
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt; If my tool becomes popular, both the upload and download mechanisms
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt; may have some impact on the grid-operators, hence this email to serve
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt; as a notice.
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt; The basic architecture is pretty simple, consisting of a number of
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt; import agents, which can import the users inventory and backing assets
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt; to a local database, and a number of upload agents which can upload
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt; inventory content to a specific account.
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt; Backup/Import
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt; There are two import agents, one which will import .iar files and one
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt; which works very much like I believe &quot;Stored Inventory&quot; works, which
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt; can backup the inventory of an avatars inventory. Avatar backup/Import
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt; is governed by a policy. Currently there are two policies,
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt; one complying with a very restrictive interpretation of the Linden
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt; Labs policy on backups, and a completely unrestricted policy, where
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt; anything that can be downloaded will be downloaded.
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt; When a new account is registered in MyInventory it checks if the
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt; account is for a Linden Lab grid and limits the choices of policies to
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt; policies suitable for LL's TOS, I cannot and do not know if other
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt; grids have similar policies, I can well imagine that Avination has a
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt; similar restrictions, and would like similar logic implemented to
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt; restrict the download. Any grid operator which would like to have
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt; backup governed by a more restrictive policy are invited to notify me
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt; and I will attempt to implement the policy prior to the first release
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt; of the source code. or supply patches at a later time.
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt; Upload/Export
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt; MyInventory supports two mechanisms for uploading inventory
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt; content, traditional upload using UDP/CAPS and direct access to the
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt; inventory and asset web-services.
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt; Due to limitations in the UDP/CAPS protocol each upload will create
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt; new assets, and as of my latest read of the Open Simulator code the
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt; asset store does not support &quot;single instance assets&quot;, i.e. it does
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt; not use a checksum to verify if the asset already exists, for this
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt; reason MyInventory prefers to upload using direct access to asset and
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt; inventory web-services.
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt; I would propose that the grids which chooses to support MyInventory
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt; augment their &quot;GridInfoService&quot; entries with the url's for the asset
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt; and inventory web-services, e.g.
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt; [GridInfoService]
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt;     assets = <A HREF="http://assets.osgrid.org">http://assets.osgrid.org</A>
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt;     inventory = <A HREF="http://inventory.osgrid.org">http://inventory.osgrid.org</A>
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt;
