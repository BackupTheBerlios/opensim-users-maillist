<PRE>Hi all,

I have had a thought that might contribute to this.  I don't know how easy
this would be to implement, but I'll put in my two cents worth.

In OpenSim, we already have the Copy/Mod/Trans permissions system to
control permissions over content.

It certainly could be argued that another could be used ... &quot;Export&quot;. 
Tools such as the one being described could check the &quot;Export&quot; permission
and, if allowed, transfer the content.  If it's not, it leaves it alone.

I really have no idea if this can be easily achieved at a technical level,
but I'm thinking it's an idea that could be worked on.  It allows a
content creator to make a choice as to whether they want to allow more
free use of their content, and would provide a way of the tool to check
whether it is allowed to copy the content.

I'm wondering what technical barriers would get in the way of implementing
something like this, and whether it is something that could be easily
achieved/

&gt;<i> Hi Chris,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well said. Your description of a legitimate use is spot on. Certainly
</I>&gt;<i> there
</I>&gt;<i> can be illegitimate uses, but that in and of itself doesn't negate the
</I>&gt;<i> fact
</I>&gt;<i> that legitimate uses exist. If I create a thing on my grid, and this tool
</I>&gt;<i> allows me to take that thing over to Fleep's grid, that seems pretty
</I>&gt;<i> legitimate to me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A tool that allows for the convenient management of allowable inventory
</I>&gt;<i> across grids is sorely needed. That a users things should travel with the
</I>&gt;<i> user seems to my tiny brain as being a no-brainer :-).
