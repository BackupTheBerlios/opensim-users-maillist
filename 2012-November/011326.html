<PRE>i cant stay out :
Comment about IAR, grid admins can already implement soem function so 
users could upload IAR files themself into the grid.
You can do that with the remote admin &quot;console&quot; command and some own 
written webpage code.  So theoretical you dont need any tool at all.
The only rem,aining part is how to get the IAR files. well the only safe 
way am seeing for people that want to give things away for free is to make
  a website so people can download there the IAR file what the then 
later can upload with the grid build IAR upload page. In my eyes is this 
still the
most safe option because people need to put there IAR's on webpage. so 
its clear the are for use on other grids. also you can add comments on 
the webpage to.

Its a bad idea central storage where assets from different grids are 
stored, the creator lose compleet track of what happens. thats anyway a 
problem.
Sofar i have read this whole thread, Hypergrid is more safe.

&gt;<i> Regarding legitimate use cases:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It would be a perfectly legitimate use for someone to download any and 
</I>&gt;<i> all content they have received on FleepGrid and then import that 
</I>&gt;<i> content into any other grid.  Every item available to another user via 
</I>&gt;<i> $0 sale or &quot;take a copy&quot; on my grid is CC licensed for such use (to 
</I>&gt;<i> the best of my knowledge) and there would be nothing illegal, immoral, 
</I>&gt;<i> or unethical about it.  In fact, I encourage it!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Likewise, it would be a perfectly legitimate use for someone to 
</I>&gt;<i> download all 500+ items I have created and listed on the FleepGrid 
</I>&gt;<i> webshop, which are primarily in IAR format, and then upload those 
</I>&gt;<i> items to any other grid.  Right now, as far as I know, the only way to 
</I>&gt;<i> do that is through console access, which means only grid owners can 
</I>&gt;<i> really use the items I put on the web, not end users.  That's due to a 
</I>&gt;<i> technical limitation of existing tools, not my intent.  My intent is 
</I>&gt;<i> for anyone to be able to use them.  If I understand Snowcrash's 
</I>&gt;<i> description correctly, his tool would make that possible for any end 
</I>&gt;<i> user of a grid, which in fact would not only be a legitimate use of 
</I>&gt;<i> the tool, but a wonderful and extremely helpful addition for those of 
</I>&gt;<i> us who opensource our content and make it available in IAR format for 
</I>&gt;<i> transport.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I really don't mean to beat a dead horse, but those are legitimate 
</I>&gt;<i> uses.  To say there is NO legitimate use of such a tool is simply not 
</I>&gt;<i> true.  What is true is that there could be both legitimate and 
</I>&gt;<i> illegitimate uses.  And I agree Snowcrash and any other developers 
</I>&gt;<i> should do their very best to safeguard against that where possible. 
</I>&gt;<i>  But you can't argue that no legitimate use case exists because I've 
</I>&gt;<i> just given several.  My desire to create content and share it freely 
</I>&gt;<i> with whoever wants to use it is as legitimate as any other content 
</I>&gt;<i> creator's desires, and ditto for any law-abiding end user who wishes 
</I>&gt;<i> to use that content in an easy, convenient, legal way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regarding the concept of &quot;my inventory&quot; (lowercase):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree with Snowcrash that the concept of &quot;my inventory&quot; is the 
</I>&gt;<i> mental construct that the vast majority of virtual world users have. 
</I>&gt;<i> Once I have personally verified the license of an opensource item and 
</I>&gt;<i> have gained access to it (currently by downloading the IAR or XML file 
</I>&gt;<i> to my local computer), then I consider that file to be &quot;mine&quot; (or my 
</I>&gt;<i> licensed copy if you prefer) to use as I wish, on any grid I wish. 
</I>&gt;<i>  The creator said I could.  Great!  Except the ability to actually use 
</I>&gt;<i> that item on any grid I wish requires me to upload it over and over 
</I>&gt;<i> each time I go to a new grid.  And for IAR items, the only portable 
</I>&gt;<i> format that fully preserves an item, I can only upload it if I have 
</I>&gt;<i> console access to the simulator - which of course I do not have access 
</I>&gt;<i> to on any grids but my own.  That is not an ideal situation at all.  I 
</I>&gt;<i> have an inventory of stuff that is mine to use, my inventory, but 
</I>&gt;<i> using it on every grid I visit is at the moment an exceedingly 
</I>&gt;<i> cumbersome process at best, and maybe not even possible at all unless 
</I>&gt;<i> I have console access.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A tool that would allow me to upload all the legally licensed XML and 
</I>&gt;<i> IAR files I am currently storing on my local computer to a third party 
</I>&gt;<i> service, that would hold those files for me, and then magically import 
</I>&gt;<i> them into any grid I visit without me having to manually do it item by 
</I>&gt;<i> item myself would be a godsend - and perfectly legal, legitimate, 
</I>&gt;<i> ethical, and proper.  I know every XML and IAR file on my local 
</I>&gt;<i> computer is licensed for such use and I would use such a tool with no 
</I>&gt;<i> hesitation at all, and would probably want to kiss the developer who 
</I>&gt;<i> made it because it would save me an enormous amount of time and effort.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regarding third party inventory services:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So let's say 20 reputable opensource content creators got together and 
</I>&gt;<i> decided to pool our resources to make a repository of content 
</I>&gt;<i> available, and we each had 500 items to contribute. Think Linda 
</I>&gt;<i> Kellie, who has the most open permissions of any Opensim creator I 
</I>&gt;<i> know, or Vanish Seriath of Opensim Creations, etc. So now we have a 
</I>&gt;<i> repository of 10,000 items that are legally licensed from trusted 
</I>&gt;<i> sources that can be used on any grid.  Would you really argue the 
</I>&gt;<i> ideal situation is that each user should manually download each item 
</I>&gt;<i> from that repository and then each user should manually upload each 
</I>&gt;<i> item to each and every grid every time they want to use something from 
</I>&gt;<i> it?  Surely not, that's crazy.  But that's pretty much the current 
</I>&gt;<i> situation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The ideal situation would be to have my inventory of legally licensed 
</I>&gt;<i> freebie and purchased content (if it was licensed for such use) hosted 
</I>&gt;<i> not on each grid, but somewhere else, and accessible to me no matter 
</I>&gt;<i> what grid I travel to without me having to do any uploading at all. 
</I>&gt;<i> When I log on to a grid, some established protocol talks to my 
</I>&gt;<i> inventory (or inventories, I can imagine multiple services/sources), 
</I>&gt;<i> displays it as a folder when I open my inventory in the GUI, and makes 
</I>&gt;<i> a local copy of an item only when I rez it out into the world, or wear 
</I>&gt;<i> it, or whatever.  Or something like that.  For freebie licensed 
</I>&gt;<i> content, perhaps grids subscribe to the third party inventory 
</I>&gt;<i> repository and provide it as a folder in the library for every user of 
</I>&gt;<i> their grid, or.. I dunno!  I can imagine many permutations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am not a developer, so I don't fully understand all the mechanisms 
</I>&gt;<i> and protocols that exist or could exist to make that kind of 
</I>&gt;<i>  functionality possible.  But in general, it seems like Snowcrash's 
</I>&gt;<i> tool is trying to implement some version of that concept, and I for 
</I>&gt;<i> one am very interested in seeing how it might be implemented in a 
</I>&gt;<i> legal and ethical way. It would solve what I view as one of the 
</I>&gt;<i> biggest obstacles to Opensim adoption - lack of easy availability and 
</I>&gt;<i> portability of known, legally licensed, trusted content.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regarding opensource content creators and the need for better 
</I>&gt;<i> mechanisms to share opensource content:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think Linda, Vanish, and I might be three largest web-based 
</I>&gt;<i> opensource content providers at the moment, but there may be more that 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know about.  I obviously can't speak for them, but for myself, 
</I>&gt;<i> I spend an _enormous_ amount of time, energy, and what amateur skill I 
</I>&gt;<i> possess not just making items for the community, but countless 
</I>&gt;<i> additional hours packaging them up, indexing them, loading them onto a 
</I>&gt;<i> website, and doing my best to make it easy for people to actually port 
</I>&gt;<i> them wherever they want and _use_ them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since I am not a coder or a programmer, I unfortunately can't 
</I>&gt;<i> contribute to the development of the Opensim code itself.  Creating 
</I>&gt;<i> openly licensed content represents my attempt to contribute to the 
</I>&gt;<i> Opensim community in another way.  Which is why it is quite sad to me 
</I>&gt;<i> that for all the countless hours of effort I've dedicated to making 
</I>&gt;<i> these resources available to people, in the hopes of making a 
</I>&gt;<i> significant positive contribution to the Opensim community, the 
</I>&gt;<i> current technical limitations prevents the vast majority of end users 
</I>&gt;<i> from being able to use my content at all!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If Snowcrash is trying to resolve that problem, I am behind that 
</I>&gt;<i> effort 100%, even if I share everyone's concerns about illegitimate 
</I>&gt;<i> uses and the need to protect others rights, and sincerely hope that 
</I>&gt;<i> those issues and concerns can be addressed, too.  But I can't agree 
</I>&gt;<i> there's no legitimate need or use for a tool such as this - from my 
</I>&gt;<i> perspective, there is in fact a great need for it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> . . .
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I do apologize, both for the tl;dr length of this post and because 
</I>&gt;<i> I've posted an awful lot in this thread, far more than I usually do. 
</I>&gt;<i> Clearly I feel passionately about the topic.  Maybe I'll try to take a 
</I>&gt;<i> backseat for a bit to make sure I'm not drowning out other voices and 
</I>&gt;<i> to think more about all of the possible implications of a tool with 
</I>&gt;<i> this functionality.  And while, for the purposes of this discussion, I 
</I>&gt;<i> am taking a strong position on the potential benefits for opensource 
</I>&gt;<i> creators and law-abiding end users, I hope it's clear that I genuinely 
</I>&gt;<i> understand, respect, and agree with many of the concerns that have 
</I>&gt;<i> been raised as well.  I want all content creators' and grid owners' 
</I>&gt;<i> rights to be respected, not just my own.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sincerely,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Chris/Fleep

</I>&gt;<i>     No, but developing and releasing a tool that has no legitimate

</I>&gt;<i>     Don't stand on your high horse Snowcrash, you're very wrong if you

</I>&gt;<i>     copyright of.    Your tool is for distributing content that you
</I>&gt;<i>     /don't/ have copyright on.   So, lets say, 'backing up' is fair

</I>&gt;<i>     violating the terms of service for that new place because you do
</I>&gt;<i>     not have the copyright to upload it...   and tosses DO say that

</I>&gt;<i>     copyrighted content from the copyright holder.      So,

</I>&gt;<i>             &gt; I fail completely to see how this tool can be a threat,

</I>&gt;<i>             &gt; hobbyist running a small grid. If content creators labor
</I>&gt;<i>             under the wrong
</I>&gt;<i>             &gt; impression that this tool is like copy-bot, then I could
</I>&gt;<i>             see why some
</I>&gt;<i>             &gt; content creators might see this as a problem.
</I>&gt;<i>             &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             This tool is PRECISELY like Copybot. It allows by default
</I>&gt;<i>             to export
</I>&gt;<i>             items that the creator has not permitted export for and
</I>&gt;<i>             has not
</I>&gt;<i>             expected that export would be easily possible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Actually it isn't, copybot - as you can see from the links I
</I>&gt;<i>         have provided - is designed to copy any view-able content,
</I>&gt;<i>         i.e. if it is present in the region, copybot enables you to
</I>&gt;<i>         copy that item. Oddly enough, that is far simpler to do than
</I>&gt;<i>         backing up contents in a users inventory. The complete
</I>&gt;<i>         functionality for copying contents in a region - al&#225; copybot -
</I>&gt;<i>         is actually already implemented in libomv, so will you ban
</I>&gt;<i>         every use of libomv as well?.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             This tool does indeed permit users to commit illegal acts by
</I>&gt;<i>             default. Depending on the jurisdiction, download and/or
</I>&gt;<i>             upload are
</I>&gt;<i>             limited by law unless explicitly permitted. Where limited
</I>&gt;<i>             by a TOS,
</I>&gt;<i>             it is illegal practically everywhere.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Nope, as a licensee I am per default allowed to use the
</I>&gt;<i>         licensed material in any way I see fit, as long as I do not
</I>&gt;<i>         violate the copyright of the copyright holder. This includes
</I>&gt;<i>         backing up, migrating to other media, and modifying for
</I>&gt;<i>         personal use. Said rights are available to me, unless I have
</I>&gt;<i>         entered into an agreement with the copyright holder not to do so.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             I do see the fundamental disagreement between the
</I>&gt;<i>             community and
</I>&gt;<i>             yourself - the community stands firmly behind the concept of
</I>&gt;<i>             intellectual property and itemwise sale while you appear
</I>&gt;<i>             to believe
</I>&gt;<i>             that digital items are mostly unowned and available to
</I>&gt;<i>             everyone to
</I>&gt;<i>             be used as they see fit.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Where have I at any point rejected the concept of intellectual
</I>&gt;<i>         property? or claimed that the licensees are unrestricted in
</I>&gt;<i>         their uses? never!, you are claims are even beyond
</I>&gt;<i>         misrepresenting what I have said.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             Please take a moment to consider - digital items _are_
</I>&gt;<i>             property.
</I>&gt;<i>             They belong to someone and that someone is not the owner
</I>&gt;<i>             of the
</I>&gt;<i>             inventory. It's the creator.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         And the license grant purchased from the copyright holder is
</I>&gt;<i>         property too!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             A tool like this has the potential to
</I>&gt;<i>             cause commercial creators to shun OpenSim completely and
</I>&gt;<i>             withdraw
</I>&gt;<i>             into SL, leaving the OpenSim based worlds at the quality
</I>&gt;<i>             level of
</I>&gt;<i>             freebies. For many of us, that quality level is not
</I>&gt;<i>             sufficient. This
</I>&gt;<i>             is why closed grids and content protection exist.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         And which is why I have offered to enable protection to those
</I>&gt;<i>         grids by implementing either the same policy as governs LL's
</I>&gt;<i>         grids or any other policy which can feasibly be implemented.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             Bringing inventory only while logged in doesn't work on a
</I>&gt;<i>             technical
</I>&gt;<i>             basis either. Assets must be present on the grid for
</I>&gt;<i>             viewing even
</I>&gt;<i>             after the user leaves.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Only assets rez'ed and left by the user needs to remain, they
</I>&gt;<i>         do not need to be stored in any inventory, since they are
</I>&gt;<i>         visible in the region, as such there is no real technical need
</I>&gt;<i>         for a huge asset server held by the grid
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             The only thing that would be feasible to
</I>&gt;<i>             transport with the avatar is clothing items and that
</I>&gt;<i>             concept has
</I>&gt;<i>             been discussed by Diva and myself years ago. The issue
</I>&gt;<i>             then was that
</I>&gt;<i>             the viewer was still GPL and off limits, so the viewer
</I>&gt;<i>             changes for
</I>&gt;<i>             that feature were considered out of reach. However, that
</I>&gt;<i>             would still
</I>&gt;<i>             not allow purchased items to travel with the user.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Are you too fine to touch GPL code? Admittedly the build
</I>&gt;<i>         process of the viewer is quite intricate, but the source is
</I>&gt;<i>         out there. Besides, who says that the URL returned in response
</I>&gt;<i>         for a CAPS request needs to reside on the server responding to
</I>&gt;<i>         the CAPS request?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             Creators have the expectation that the grid they upload
</I>&gt;<i>             their items
</I>&gt;<i>             to protects their IP rights. They don't expect the user to
</I>&gt;<i>             be aware
</I>&gt;<i>             of the law or follow it - they expect the grids to do that
</I>&gt;<i>             with
</I>&gt;<i>             their TOS and their legal teams.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         If that was the case, I pity the hobbiest grid operators,
</I>&gt;<i>         because putting the onus of protecting content creators assets
</I>&gt;<i>         on individual grid operators is leaving them wide open to
</I>&gt;<i>         litigation!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             SecondInventory has respected this by disallowing the
</I>&gt;<i>             download of
</I>&gt;<i>             items the user has not created. They made that impossible
</I>&gt;<i>             to change
</I>&gt;<i>             by keeping their tool closed source. Their tool has become the
</I>&gt;<i>             accepted means of moving creations between worlds.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             As open source, your tool can be trivially modified by the
</I>&gt;<i>             less
</I>&gt;<i>             morally inclined. I would expect the community to shun
</I>&gt;<i>             your too like
</I>&gt;<i>             copybot is shunned. I would expect the reputation of
</I>&gt;<i>             copies of your
</I>&gt;<i>             tool that have been illegally modified to reflect on the
</I>&gt;<i>             original,
</I>&gt;<i>             unmodified tool and thereby cause grids, over time, to
</I>&gt;<i>             detect and
</I>&gt;<i>             ban the use of any tool descended from it, ban the users
</I>&gt;<i>             using it
</I>&gt;<i>             and confiscate inventories from these users. Is it really your
</I>&gt;<i>             desire to become the author of super copybot?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         You seem to have great respect for my coding skills &quot;super
</I>&gt;<i>         copybot&quot;, the source code for everything is already out there,
</I>&gt;<i>         all I have done is combine what already exists and wrap it in
</I>&gt;<i>         a user interface.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             Your standard response of &quot;closed source is security by
</I>&gt;<i>             obscurity&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>             doesn't wash either. If there were a tool out there that
</I>&gt;<i>             is easy to
</I>&gt;<i>             use and allows trivially copying complete items on a large
</I>&gt;<i>             scale and
</I>&gt;<i>             that tool were just hard to find, I'd have to agree.
</I>&gt;<i>             However, there
</I>&gt;<i>             is no such tool. 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Yes there is, libomv, backup command line tool!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             All existing tools are complex or broken, often
</I>&gt;<i>             both. Releasing your tool as open source can be extremely
</I>&gt;<i>             harmful to
</I>&gt;<i>             the continuum of grids commonly known as the &quot;metaverse&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             A significant portion of the metaverse relies on commerce and
</I>&gt;<i>             commerce cannot be sustained in the presence of wholesale
</I>&gt;<i>             theft.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         great piece of demagoguery, are you by any
</I>&gt;<i>         chance rhetorically trained?  so now releasing a legitimate
</I>&gt;<i>         tool is the same as performing wholesale theft?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Since you are going beyond misrepresentation and resorting to
</I>&gt;<i>         demagoguery I can only surmise that you still oppose the tool
</I>&gt;<i>         but lack additional rational arguments against it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Best regards
</I>&gt;<i>         Snowcrash
