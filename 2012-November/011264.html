<PRE>SnowCrash says:
&quot;There is no if about it, the code is ready for release, currently I'm
working on a windows installer and documentation. Initially the code will
be released under AGPL, once the code base is more mature I intend to
change the licence to BSD.  I have decided to wait for two weeks after my
initial announcement, because I wanted to give grid operators a heads up
before releasing the code.&quot;

Sorry fleep, That's a gauntlet, that's not a 'working with the community'
statement.   That's 'I'm releasing it whether you like it or not'.

The truth is, there are many options that would make something like this
legitimate if done correctly...   but as the 'code is ready for release'
and he's just working on installers and documentation now, 'the pool is
closed'...  so naturally, the reactions are not going to be good after that
statement.

&gt;<i> I would encourage everyone to try to keep the conversation civil and
</I>&gt;<i> respectful.  Heated rhetoric generally helps no one and can quickly derail
</I>&gt;<i> honest efforts to communicate about difficult topics.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I interpreted Snowcrash's communications as an effort to dialogue with the
</I>&gt;<i> community.  He asked for feedback, he stated repeatedly that his intention
</I>&gt;<i> is not to aid content theft, and he said he was open to suggestions for
</I>&gt;<i> protecting grid operators' and content creators' rights.  Nothing has been
</I>&gt;<i> released yet, so I'm assuming good faith on Snowcrash's part, and hope we
</I>&gt;<i> can continue to have that conversation in a polite way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd also point out again that there are many kinds of content creators
</I>&gt;<i> with many kinds of intents for our content.  My desire to widely share and
</I>&gt;<i> openly license the content I create is as important to me as another
</I>&gt;<i> creator's desire to control access to their content is to them.  As I said
</I>&gt;<i> before, I often feel that those of us who prefer to open source our content
</I>&gt;<i> are in some ways held hostage by the concerns of the latter group, which I
</I>&gt;<i> happen to agree with Snowcrash, is to the detriment of the Opensim
</I>&gt;<i> community as a whole.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> IMO, the goal should be to design systems and tools that give ALL creators
</I>&gt;<i> the ability to clearly communicate and attach their intentions/license
</I>&gt;<i> terms to assets in a way that is respected and enforced as much as possible
</I>&gt;<i> by the Opensim code and through policies and configuration settings
</I>&gt;<i> available to grid operators.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would love to see a tool that aids the portability of _legitimately
</I>&gt;<i> licensed_ assets between grids, but unfortunately we're still stuck with
</I>&gt;<i> the problem that content creators' intentions and license terms are NOT
</I>&gt;<i> attached to existing objects.  If there's no license, I don't see a way to
</I>&gt;<i> safely, legally allow the portability of assets from one grid to another en
</I>&gt;<i> masse through a tool like this  :(

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There is only one proper response to this &quot;declaration of disregard&quot; for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the policies and efforts of this community to prevent the distribution of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tools designed to subvert the rights of content creators....  Otherwise,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> those IAR files you want to load will never have the quantity and quality
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of legal assets you desire.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There are a multitude of ways to resolve these asset sharing/transfer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> issues,  and a LOT of good work has been done.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      Yes,  we need an easier way to load IAR files....
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                      Why don't you implement this as a first step and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> start the process of working WITH the community?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                      (Instead of proclaiming your intent to implement
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> something that requires us to react in a publicly negative way)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      Yes,  we probably need to implement some kind of license tagging to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> assets to properly identify those place in the PD BY the creator.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                     Even so,  I lend my voice to the chorus of  &quot;IANAL
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> BUT.... I hope you confer with proper legal counsel before you jump off the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> liability cliff &quot; ....
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I hope my response to your request for grid operators to participate in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this discussion is clear....
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       I will disconnect and ban anyone who attempts to connect to any of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the grids I administer using this tool.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       I will publicly identify those users and share all the information
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am able to collect with all of the operators of any other grid I can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> communicate with .
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Those of us who have been here a while have seen this all before, and I'm
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sure we will see it again.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The response can only be &quot;We do NOT want your tool as designed,  we WILL
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> NOT tolerate its use.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> NO, there are NO valid reasons to welcome a tool that incorporates a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> disregard for an important part of the Opensim community (creators)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Public pressure was enough to thwart the public release of the last
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;OpenSource sim copy utility&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I continue to hope that the vocal opposition we expressed as a community
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to that effort is brought to bear here as well..
