<PRE>I am sorry to hear this will be available as opensource.
Many small grids will not have the ability to aviod and monitor the usage of these kind of applications.
Content protection should be a high priority.

I do think all private assets ( made by the individual ) should be allowed to be backed up from inworld.
Copying &quot;Any Full perm&quot; and distribute it through all grids is somthing i am strongly against.
The permisions are given inside a grid and should stay there.
The idea to give access to asset servers and let the &quot;people&quot; be responsible for the content is a mad idea.. sorry to say so.
The service giving Grid is allways responsible for all content they host.
When i read about this at first i thought it had potential......

Please think about what you are making and what the concequences will be for small starting grids and also for the people that will be using it.
Also know that most &quot;proper&quot; grids will disable your tool from logging in so it will be worthless at the end.
Probably your tool will end up in people getting banned from there worlds, i dont think that is the idea behind such a appliaction.
Please take this in concideration as we will also permanatly ban this tool when it does not protect our creators.
* i know a lot of other grids will do the same in the current situation.
We just want to give our creators  fair change for there hard work, and we will do everything needed to protect that.
I hope you understand our point of vieuw, and you will think about how to implement that into your application.

Best regards,

Martin Forster

    Hi,

    Closed source means that it's not trivially possible to modify the
    tool to assume the open policy for all grids and then put the
    modified tool in the wild for all and sundry to abuse.
    Most existing tools are either hacking tools sold through dubious
    channels, difficult to use or lack important features. There is to
    this day no free, widely available, open source, easy to use content
    ripping tool. Your project is bound to become that tool if it is
    released as open source.

  There is no if about it, the code is ready for release, currently I'm working on a windows installer and documentation. Initially the code will be released under AGPL, once the code base is more mature I intend to change the licence to BSD. 


  I have decided to wait for two weeks after my initial announcement, because I wanted to give grid operators a heads up before releasing the code.

    &gt; Atleast it will be very simple for the administrator to determine if assets
    &gt; are being duplicated, especially if MyInventory is being used in a mode
    &gt; where it accesses the asset service directly.


    No closed grid will ever be able to provide direct asset service
    connections because these also allow to extract any and all content,
    in full quality and without restrictions. This would include script
    sources - an unacceptable situation.



  Not really, it would be almost trivial to implement an asset service which restricted access to assets, at least in a non hyper-grid scenario. The only worry would be rouge simulators which could be attached to an existing grid.


  On a similar note it would almost as easy to implement a fully distributed asset server, which retrieved assets from the users local asset store, &quot;My Suitcase&quot; is clearly an example that such a scheme is not only feasible but almost fully implemented in the existing code base. The only question is whether grid operators are willing to surrender control of assets, and leave those assets to be the responsibility of the visiting users. This distributed asset store, where asset are fetched from individual users' asset stores would very likely - and counter intuitively - be the one that offered the greatest amount of protection against asset theft compared to a hypergrid enabled grids asset store.
