<PRE>Just so everyone knows, I didn't miss the point of this message.  I am 
aching to clear this up about myself.  My Avatar as well as myself are 
both MALE.  I noticed in this message that it is being confused.  It 
don't really matter. but I had to straighten it out.  Seven years ago 
when I joined SL, InuYasha was one of my favorite Anime series.  It is a 
Japanese name for the main character who happens to be a Half-Demon.  
The name is like saying he is a half powered demon, half breed.  It is 
pronounced EEnuYasha, in Japanese I's are pronounced like EE's.

The anime don't really give a last name and I didn't want to steal it 
anyways, so I used a time period.  I thought back when I joined I would 
be interested in the Meiji era.  I didn't really think I would stay that 
long in Secondlife and wasn't thinking I would carry this name so long.  
After two years I settled on and fell in love with the ancient Okinawan 
Culture.  I have been studying it and learning techniques of that 
culture for over 5 years now. I have way outgrown the character name and 
became much more serious about it.  MY problem is most people I know met 
me under the InuYasha name.  I wanted people in OSGrid to know who I was 
from SL.  In SL I use the display name Yuukyu.  It is a name I choose, 
sounds Okinawan, but it translates to the word meaning &quot;Eternal&quot;, 
because I feel like I been in virtual worlds forever now.  lol.

Opensim is great to me.  There are so many other important things going 
on and fixes needed.  I haven't officially made a request, but hoping at 
some point opensim will support the renaming/display names that SL 
does.  Then I could use Yuukyu on my grid as well as Osgrid.  I use 
Firestorm and to change your display name open your profile and click 
the wrench icon.  It then ask you for a display name.

Yuukyu/(InuYasha Meiji)

&gt;<i> SnowCrash,
</I>&gt;<i> Firstly,  Say what you mean to say.... and choose your words carefully 
</I>&gt;<i> because a lot of people will base their opinions of your tool on 
</I>&gt;<i> them.  Be clear about what you're writing and what other people will 
</I>&gt;<i> think it means when they read it.   It's much harder to take back a 
</I>&gt;<i> comment after the fact then it is to say the right thing the first time.
</I>&gt;<i> To address your comments:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. As far as it being a gauntlet, you said that you were at the 
</I>&gt;<i> installer stage and the code is ready for release and what you were 
</I>&gt;<i> working on now is the 'documentation' and 'installer'.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   * Ready for release means that it's done being worked on prior to
</I>&gt;<i>     release.    It also means that any changes that the community
</I>&gt;<i>     suggests would then have to be implemented and tested/validated
</I>&gt;<i>     delaying release.
</I>&gt;<i>   * You also said that, assuming the grid owner contacted you, you'd
</I>&gt;<i>     'attempt' to get it in _before releasing the source_,  &quot;Any grid
</I>&gt;<i>     operator which would like to have backup governed by a more
</I>&gt;<i>     restrictive policy are invited to notify me and I will attempt to
</I>&gt;<i>     implement the policy prior to the first release of the source
</I>&gt;<i>     code. or supply patches at a later time.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>   * You're_not_ saying that you'll get the policies in_before the
</I>&gt;<i>     first product release,_ you're saying you'll get them in place
</I>&gt;<i>     _before the /source/ is released._
</I>&gt;<i>   * If this isn't the case and you're willing to put in extra effort
</I>&gt;<i>     getting a solid permission framework in place before
</I>&gt;<i>     product release(which, in my opinion, may take weeks or months to
</I>&gt;<i>     properly set up), then please say so.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2._You developed this tool in a vacuum_ and did not involve anyone 
</I>&gt;<i> from /this/ community in the process until it's already being released..
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   * You're not compromising on the permissions before product release,
</I>&gt;<i>     just source release..
</I>&gt;<i>   * it's definately going to be released.. &quot;There is no if about
</I>&gt;<i>     it&quot; as a response to a perfectly valid argument (that I'll
</I>&gt;<i>     elaborate on below)...   I'd say that's throwing down the gauntlet.
</I>&gt;<i>   * This, 'developed in a vacuum' fact is further evidenced by the
</I>&gt;<i>     fact that you are not very familiar with the copybot
</I>&gt;<i>     discussions...   Had you even mentioned the project to the
</I>&gt;<i>     community here and the fact that it was going to &quot;download
</I>&gt;<i>     anything that it could&quot;, they would/have immediately/ made
</I>&gt;<i>     references to copybot and SecondInventory.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. &quot;I do however stand my statement that I am willing to listen 
</I>&gt;<i> suggestions from the community as long as they do not in a significant 
</I>&gt;<i> way deprive users of their legitimate rights.&quot;. Ok fair enough, 
</I>&gt;<i> so/who's/ judging what's legitimate and not, You? How are you 
</I>&gt;<i> qualified to judge what's right and not? Are you an appointed judge or 
</I>&gt;<i> an IP/copyright attorney? Do you have years of experience dealing with 
</I>&gt;<i> IP, copyright?   You're a software developer /who _hasn't_ effectively 
</I>&gt;<i> argued that your program has a legitimate use/ and by legitimate, I 
</I>&gt;<i> mean doesn't violate someone's rights and/or breach a contract.    The 
</I>&gt;<i> reason that, at this moment, you cannot claim a valid use is there's 
</I>&gt;<i> no technically respected way to declare that content is exportable, 
</I>&gt;<i> and therefore the assumption is that it's not exportable.   You may 
</I>&gt;<i> not care who's rights the application that you created is violating... 
</I>&gt;<i> but if that's the case, then don't claim to be an advocate for user's 
</I>&gt;<i> rights....   it's designed to violate rights.
</I>&gt;<i> You saw dz's reaction, you saw Inu's reaction.
</I>&gt;<i> As far as rights...    Inu freebied items that she sells on Agni for 
</I>&gt;<i> use on her own grid.. but because there's a user friendly tool to take 
</I>&gt;<i> 'freebee' items from grid to grid, doing so actually risks her ability 
</I>&gt;<i> to sell it. She freebied the items for the very same reason that 
</I>&gt;<i> you're writing this program.. because there's a content gap.   Does 
</I>&gt;<i> Inu have rights when it comes to that?    Are you seriously going to 
</I>&gt;<i> argue that Inu shouldn't have freebied the item for use on inu's grid?
</I>&gt;<i> To be clear, I don't have a problem with content transfer in 
</I>&gt;<i> general... just content transfer that violates a previously agreed 
</I>&gt;<i> upon contract. If there's a mechanism that detects a 'Creative Commons 
</I>&gt;<i> or other permissive copyright notecard in the object', then I'm all 
</I>&gt;<i> for that. The problem is that there are assumptions and agreements 
</I>&gt;<i> that people make about the state of things that, when the state 
</I>&gt;<i> suddenly changes, rights are violated. So what has changed? You're 
</I>&gt;<i> providing an /easy/ way for non technical users to transfer their 
</I>&gt;<i> content... that you want this program to be accepted in the community 
</I>&gt;<i> and not shunned like many others.
</I>&gt;<i> If your ultimate dream is inventory stores be decentralized, 
</I>&gt;<i> then you should be working on that and not intermediary hacks like 
</I>&gt;<i> this.    And, we should be open and transparent with the content 
</I>&gt;<i> creators when their content is going outside a walled garden so that 
</I>&gt;<i> they can make an informed decision about the actions that they 
</I>&gt;<i> take.       Anything less, is probably going to panic content creators 
</I>&gt;<i> who are just starting to feel comfortable with OpenSimulator.
</I>&gt;<i> Just a note, I'm not a grid operator. I don't own a grid. I don't 
</I>&gt;<i> operate one. On Agni, I created 6 products that, the proceeds of the 
</I>&gt;<i> product licensing were immediately donated to the local community 
</I>&gt;<i> events. I'm not a major content creator and the earnings from content 
</I>&gt;<i> that I did create were donated to the community.    I'm not someone 
</I>&gt;<i> making a killing from content creation...   or world hosting...    I'm 
</I>&gt;<i> not entirely an independent party though,    I'm a software developer 
</I>&gt;<i> and I feel very strongly about content licenses.   I paid microsoft 
</I>&gt;<i> for windows for each of my computers (I have 6 computers in 
</I>&gt;<i> operation(two are macs with Parallels)).   My music comes from the 
</I>&gt;<i> iTunes Store, not bittorrent...   etc.       On the other hand, I 
</I>&gt;<i> still hold a grudge against Sony for Michael Lynton's comments about 
</I>&gt;<i> the internet ( <A HREF="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13846_3-10242526-62.html">http://news.cnet.com/8301-13846_3-10242526-62.html</A> ) 
</I>&gt;<i> because he brands internet users as content theives...  which was 
</I>&gt;<i> famously misquoted as him saying, &quot;I'm a guy who doesn't see anything 
</I>&gt;<i> good having come from the Internet&quot;.    I don't think that internet 
</I>&gt;<i> users are naturally theives and..... history has shown again and 
</I>&gt;<i> again that when the technology is easily accessible and capable of 
</I>&gt;<i> acquiring content illegally and the technology is easy to use, the 
</I>&gt;<i> prevalence of license infringement goes up.   I think it's more of an 
</I>&gt;<i> 'easy to forget' thing that I'm supposed to pay to use that... and not 
</I>&gt;<i> a willfull infringement.   It's the license infringement triangle..   
</I>&gt;<i> like the fire triangle...   Fire needs oxygen, a fuel source, and an 
</I>&gt;<i> ignition, but I digress....
</I>&gt;<i> If you're really interested in working with the community, then listen 
</I>&gt;<i> to them.      My suggestion, at this point, is to work on implementing 
</I>&gt;<i> the means where a grid transfer license can be checked and respected 
</I>&gt;<i> technically and open source most of your app but leave the part that 
</I>&gt;<i> actually does the 'taking' of things and respecting of permissions 
</I>&gt;<i> closed source as a dll.
</I>&gt;<i> The issue with open sourcing that part is...    even if you choose to 
</I>&gt;<i> work with the community, the source is out there and someone can use 
</I>&gt;<i> the source and run a parallel project /not/ respecting permissions and 
</I>&gt;<i> distribute it in the guise of your legitimate program.    I know 
</I>&gt;<i> security through obscurity isn't security...    and are you OK with 
</I>&gt;<i> proving a complete license infringement triangle enabling thoughtless 
</I>&gt;<i> wide scale license infringement?   I wouldn't be.

</I>&gt;<i>             about difficult topics.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             I interpreted Snowcrash's communications as an effort to
</I>&gt;<i>             dialogue with the community.  He asked for feedback, he
</I>&gt;<i>             stated repeatedly that his intention is not to aid content
</I>&gt;<i>             theft, and he said he was open to suggestions for
</I>&gt;<i>             protecting grid operators' and content creators' rights.
</I>&gt;<i>              Nothing has been released yet, so I'm assuming good faith
</I>&gt;<i>             on Snowcrash's part, and hope we can continue to have that
</I>&gt;<i>             conversation in a polite way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             I'd also point out again that there are many kinds of
</I>&gt;<i>             content creators with many kinds of intents for our
</I>&gt;<i>             content.  My desire to widely share and openly license the
</I>&gt;<i>             content I create is as important to me as another
</I>&gt;<i>             creator's desire to control access to their content is to
</I>&gt;<i>             them.  As I said before, I often feel that those of us who
</I>&gt;<i>             prefer to open source our content are in some ways held
</I>&gt;<i>             hostage by the concerns of the latter group, which I
</I>&gt;<i>             happen to agree with Snowcrash, is to the detriment of the
</I>&gt;<i>             Opensim community as a whole.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             IMO, the goal should be to design systems and tools that
</I>&gt;<i>             give ALL creators the ability to clearly communicate and
</I>&gt;<i>             attach their intentions/license terms to assets in a way
</I>&gt;<i>             that is respected and enforced as much as possible by the
</I>&gt;<i>             Opensim code and through policies and configuration
</I>&gt;<i>             settings available to grid operators.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             I would love to see a tool that aids the portability of
</I>&gt;<i>             _legitimately licensed_ assets between grids, but
</I>&gt;<i>             unfortunately we're still stuck with the problem that
</I>&gt;<i>             content creators' intentions and license terms are NOT
</I>&gt;<i>             attached to existing objects.  If there's no license, I
</I>&gt;<i>             don't see a way to safely, legally allow the portability

</I>&gt;<i>                                      (Instead of proclaiming your
</I>&gt;<i>                 intent to implement something that requires us to
</I>&gt;<i>                 react in a publicly negative way)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                      Yes,  we probably need to implement some kind of
</I>&gt;<i>                 license tagging to assets to properly identify those
</I>&gt;<i>                 place in the PD BY the creator.
</I>&gt;<i>                                     Even so,  I lend my voice to the
</I>&gt;<i>                 chorus of &quot;IANAL BUT.... I hope you confer with proper
</I>&gt;<i>                 legal counsel before you jump off the liability cliff
</I>&gt;<i>                 &quot; ....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                 I hope my response to your request for grid operators
</I>&gt;<i>                 to participate in this discussion is clear....
</I>&gt;<i>                       I will disconnect and ban anyone who attempts to
</I>&gt;<i>                 connect to any of the grids I administer using this tool.
</I>&gt;<i>                       I will publicly identify those users and share
</I>&gt;<i>                 all the information I am able to collect with all of
</I>&gt;<i>                 the operators of any other grid I can communicate with .
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                 Those of us who have been here a while have seen this
</I>&gt;<i>                 all before, and I'm sure we will see it again.
</I>&gt;<i>                 The response can only be &quot;We do NOT want your tool as
</I>&gt;<i>                 designed, we WILL NOT tolerate its use.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                 NO, there are NO valid reasons to welcome a tool that
</I>&gt;<i>                 incorporates a disregard for an important part of the
</I>&gt;<i>                 Opensim community (creators)
</I>&gt;<i>                 Public pressure was enough to thwart the public
</I>&gt;<i>                 release of the last &quot;OpenSource sim copy utility&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>                 I continue to hope that the vocal opposition we
</I>&gt;<i>                 expressed as a community to that effort is brought to
</I>&gt;<i>                 bear here as well..
