You're sort of right that you can't do anything about it, but not for 
the reasons you think.
If you take time to think about it, you will come to the conclusion, 
like many of us have, that those grids are hopelessly insecure. Checking 
sessions ids and permissions will not make them less insecure, given 
that anyone can plug a simulator to it running all sorts of rogue code. 
It's an architecture that is impossible to sustain. Hence, other 
alternatives like the Hypergrid.

But if those are your favorite grids, I encourage you to provide 
services that make them slightly less insecure.
