This would be a really bad idea, and I'll be the first to discourage 
grid operators from doing this. You're basically asking grid operators 
to place their internal inventory services on the Internet, which would 
put inventories at risk. Wiping out entire inventories would be trivial. 
(Yes, osgrid does this, but that's because it has no choice, given its 
purpose and configuration)

These services are designed to be called by the simulators *only*. They 
are devoid of any security or permissions checks *whatsoever*. They're 
basically just getters/setters for the database. That's on purpose; in a 
system like what we have at hand, the simulators are the ones doing the 
security / permissions checks, so doing them again in the backend 
[internal] services would be redundant.

That's why we have been designing other services on top of the database, 
the HG services, which toughen security. So pointing this to the HG 
services might make sense. You'll find those configs in the HG versions 
of the configuration files under the [LoginService] section.
