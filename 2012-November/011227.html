Well, true indeed, but the most important tool itself for copybotting 
all stuff out of SL, Opensim and so on has been GPLed OSS since 2007 - 
namely the Second Life Viewer. All you ever need to copy stuff is in 
there, so it is no wonder most people nowadays use illegitimate versions 
of the viewer to copy stuff if the want to.

&gt;<i> IMHO, open source is a very bad idea for this type of software.
</I>
Since the tools to do have been around already as OSS for over five 
years, that claim is being disputable. Though of course lowering the 
barrier to copy stuff is always something that must be taken into 
consideration wisely.
