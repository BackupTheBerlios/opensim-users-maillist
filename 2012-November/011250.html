<PRE>Hi,

That is a great idea, too, and will ease access to free and open
licensed content. However, such a service would be responsible for
not distributing content that has no valid license for.

DMCA applies in the US only. Other countries depend on existing
copyright law. This differs from country to country. Some place all
responsibility with the distributor or service provider, others with
users. Almost all require formal suit to be brought, which is not
feasible for a $0.10 item. However, nor suing can lead to a virtual
business being destroyed by 10s of thousands of such thefts because
the proliferation of the free copies makes the original, licensed
item unsaleable. Therefore, technological protection to prevent
&quot;casual&quot; copying need to be in place and the software needs to guide
the user to not export things that they have no permission to export.
The only way to make this in any way safe is to keep it closed source.
