<PRE>Sorry for the second replay.  Forgot to update my tag lines at the 
bottom.  I set this up this way in 7.3.1, and it ran fine.  Plus, I am 
saving money for a monster machine.  I am one third of the way there.  I 
want a duel CPU AMD 3+ Bulldozer set up.  Each CPU with 16 cores.  This 
will total 32 cores and 192 GB of ram running on Windows 7 64bit 
Ultimate. and a half a terabyte SSD Sata III,  The mobo runs all this 
with hyperthreading.  But for now, I am running this old thing listed at 
the bottom of my emails.

Even on this old computer no change since 7.3.1 it wasn't horrible.  I 
am set up using Robust in grid mode now.  Not connected to other grid, 
this is the grid.  My regions are split into 8 other directories running 
about 8 or less regions of opensim each.  I say 8 or less because most 
run 8, but in the middle I have one two region mega region in the 
center.  I plan to build Okinawa's Shuri Castle and didn't want people 
falling into a region border while crossing the courtyard.

I may have to take that out, because it seems I do have issues walking 
from a normal sim to the megaregion at times.  But the rest of my 56 
regions seems to do fine for now. I can build very well and get the 
objects done, and take them into inventory now and again until I get my 
monster system and can put it all out at once and more permanently placed.

At the moment I have landscaping, and a small growing Ryukyu Kingdom 
late 17th century village.  This was all working in 7.3.1, I upgraded 
and suddenly,  my doors went wonky.  In SL and 7.3.1 the same script 
would move the doors, while the sound set off at the same moment.  The 
sound file is short and sounds like a sort of large wooden sliding barn 
door.  The inside has thin washi paper doors, and a sound from a sliding 
paper door I had.  Those doors also timed correctly in SL and 7.3.1 of 
Opensim.

After the upgrade, and copying the info from the 7.3.1 and typing it in 
by hand, clicking the door, results in, the sound starting imidiately, 
then my AV has time to stop showing a beam from the hand, and puts his 
arm at his side, wait a bit more then the door using the lsl while to 
slide the door starts and slides to where it should go.  It seems the 
reaction time varies.  And the door don't slide smooth like it used to.  
It was and is, supposed to use the WHILE to use a counter to slide the 
door, nice and smooth, but it seems to move a bit, pause a couple of 
random times and spaces while sliding, and eventually move into place.

This is the entire problem.  I dicovered that since the sound starts 
nearly at clicking that is must not be the click event that is slow.  
Because the sound does start on clicking.  Only the door no longer 
starts slidinging for what is nearly 2 seconds after hearing the sound.  
At least it seems that long.  Like I said, I might have missed something 
someplace.  I am legally blind with only one eye with a retina 
detachment in the one good eye.  I definatly could have.  But where to 
look for something like that? All my other scripts seem to be ok.  
Korean black conon fires, paper lantern with menu lights and extinguish, 
and ower user controls, are all working.  But the lights don't have a 
sound associated with them.

Sorry this mesage was so long, but I guess I wanted to clean up any 
confusion.
Thanks so much for your time and interest.

InuYasha.

</I>&gt;<i> than a couple on a simulator (and many people run 1, preferring to 
</I>&gt;<i> start separate OpenSim.exe instances instead!. So the basic things 
</I>&gt;<i> would be to try is seeing if reducing the number of regions (hence 
</I>&gt;<i> reducing other script load, etc.) makes a difference.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Making sure it isn't only me, noticing, after upgrading from 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Opensim 7.3.1 to Opensim 7.4 my touch to run scripts
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     slowing down. Specifically sliding doors that used to react when 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> clicked to start sliding.  Now, my Avatar appears
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     to raise a hand to click the door, the particle beam starts, then 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stops, and with enough time to move my arm back
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     down, a total of two seconds and then the door finally moves.  It 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> was almost instant in version 7.3.1.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Could I have made a bad setting to slow it down to start the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> click event to start sliding so late, or is this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     something other people see in their touch to start scripts. My 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sliding door sound used to start and seemed to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     perfectly timed so the door would slide at the same time as the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> door would move.  Now I hear the sound many seconds
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     before the door moves and finishes way before the door stops 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> moving because it started so late.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Anything I can do?  Or should I start a mantis?  I used the same 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> script in SL, and in 7.3.1 that acted the same, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     not anymore.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Thanks for any time on this, you friend and big fan, InuYasha.
