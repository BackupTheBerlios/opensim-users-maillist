<PRE>I think that giving a everybody a feel for what the tool is really about,
prior to going open source is an excellent idea.

I think this would be beneficial for all. The community could help identify
issues before they were &quot;let loose in the wild&quot;, as I have said repeatedly,
MyInventory is not intended to be a tool for ripping assets, on the other
hand I am of the firm conviction that the end-user has far too little
control of his or her own inventory, and that access to content is one of
two major obstacles preventing users from adopting opensim on a wider scale.

best regards
Snowcrash

&gt;<i> I wanted to throw one other thought out there before I head off for a
</I>&gt;<i> Friday full of meetings.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A few months ago, I made a blog post encouraging Second Life users to move
</I>&gt;<i> beyond that platform if they wished to see the Metaverse we imagined become
</I>&gt;<i> a reality.  I suggested exploring Opensim as a first step in that process,
</I>&gt;<i> in part because it's an easy transition from SL to Opensim due to
</I>&gt;<i> their similarities, but also because in my view, the Opensim community is
</I>&gt;<i> far more forward thinking and dedicated to the Metaverse concept and ideal
</I>&gt;<i> than Linden Lab probably ever was, and certainly more than Linden Lab is
</I>&gt;<i> now (which is to say, not at all!).  I won't repeat the post, but feel free
</I>&gt;<i> to read it if you're interested:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.fleeptuque.com/blog/2012/08/why-anyone-who-cares-about-the-metaverse-needs-to-move-beyond-second-life-now-not-later/">http://www.fleeptuque.com/blog/2012/08/why-anyone-who-cares-about-the-metaverse-needs-to-move-beyond-second-life-now-not-later/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was shocked, flabbergasted really, by the huge response to that post.  I
</I>&gt;<i> just don't see 100+ comments on my blog posts very often, and while many of
</I>&gt;<i> them were nostalgic about the early years of SL, if you were to read
</I>&gt;<i> through those comments, you would see the terrible impression that many
</I>&gt;<i> Second Life users have about Opensim all boils down to perceived (and real)
</I>&gt;<i> content theft.  In the US, they talk about large entitlements being the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;third rail&quot; of politics - meaning the topic is electric and any politician
</I>&gt;<i> who goes near it is likely to be killed.  Copyright/IP and exporting
</I>&gt;<i> content to other grids is the &quot;third rail&quot; of Opensim.  The mere mention of
</I>&gt;<i> the topic generates enormous amounts of passion on every side of the issue.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Nevertheless, these are the hard problems that innovators and pioneers
</I>&gt;<i> must solve.  If it were easy, anyone could do it and we'd already be
</I>&gt;<i> further along down the Metaverse path than we are.  But it isn't easy, it's
</I>&gt;<i> complicated, and fraught with not only legal concerns, but ethical and
</I>&gt;<i> moral ones too.  The only way to move forward is to try new things, to make
</I>&gt;<i> best efforts to address as many sides of the issue as possible, and to keep
</I>&gt;<i> the channels of communication and dialogue open.  Demonizing those on any
</I>&gt;<i> side of the issue is likely to get us no where and only furthers the
</I>&gt;<i> perception that the problems are unsolvable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> From my view, Snowcrash has identified a legitimate area where Opensim
</I>&gt;<i> needs more development, more eyes on the problem, and more efforts to
</I>&gt;<i> achieve workable solutions.  I don't know that the tool he has designed is
</I>&gt;<i> the best solution, but I do appreciate that he has asked for feedback, I do
</I>&gt;<i> appreciate the commitment to open source his attempt at a solution, and I
</I>&gt;<i> definitely would hate to see him killed on sight for having the gumption to
</I>&gt;<i> try to approach the third rail. Someone needs to!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I might suggest, Snowcrash, that when you're ready, perhaps you could
</I>&gt;<i> release the tool in a limited pilot phase first and allow some of the
</I>&gt;<i> developers and end users here in the community to test it, see how it
</I>&gt;<i> functions, and give you additional feedback before you release it more
</I>&gt;<i> widely or open the source.  It isn't just hysteria or knee-jerk reaction on
</I>&gt;<i> the part of those with concern, many of us have been fighting the
</I>&gt;<i> perception that Opensim is all about content theft for years, and in part
</I>&gt;<i> because there HAS been a lot of theft, and it IS a tricky problem to solve.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to think the community has the capacity to find a good way
</I>&gt;<i> forward, even if we can't solve every problem immediately or with a single
</I>&gt;<i> tool.  Still, a step forward is a step forward, and I'd be happy to
</I>&gt;<i> volunteer as a pilot tester if you're open to that idea.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Users have right too, you know?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Absolutely. Believe me, I'm a huge supporter of user's rights. These
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> include things like (as they're known in the U.S.) fair use and first sale
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> doctrines. But I ask you not to forget forget that the ability to exercise
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> copyright or enter into a contract is *also* a user's right.  This isn't a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Them against Us&quot; issue. It's an _ALL of us_ issue. Fighting for one set of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rights while disregarding or undermining other rights is not a tenable
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> position.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I've would adore it if someone were to step up and pull people together
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> into finally wrangling a framework that allows for people like Fleep to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> share her creations freely across virtual worlds in a user friendly format,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> while also allowing commercial creators to have a reasonable expectation of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the preservation of their licenses and copyrights. That should be the real
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> project here. There's too many missing pieces at the moment. Getting an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> export flag implemented on the server and in viewers, although an imperfect
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> solution, would be an excellent way to get the ball rolling.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Any other action, I think, will tend to be perceived as a, &quot;I want what I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> want, and I want it now, damn the consequences,&quot; response to the community,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> whether or not that perception is warranted.
