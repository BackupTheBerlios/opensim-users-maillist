<PRE>Hi Teravus,

Unless there are some bugs that make it fail, that feature is already 
implemented for a long time. See
<A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/viewgit/?a=viewblob&amp;p=opensim&amp;h=84dec8d38965829e2c280de98d036b70af5915af&amp;hb=f656adee31f5210acb4d1c8c89fe0d1e9362feee&amp;f=OpenSim/Services/HypergridService/HGAssetService.cs">http://opensimulator.org/viewgit/?a=viewblob&amp;p=opensim&amp;h=84dec8d38965829e2c280de98d036b70af5915af&amp;hb=f656adee31f5210acb4d1c8c89fe0d1e9362feee&amp;f=OpenSim/Services/HypergridService/HGAssetService.cs</A>
At the end of that file, there are functions that rewrite assets 
adjusting their creator ids.

This doesn't work when the assets originate in OSGrid, as osgrid is 
using the internal services as HG services... But it should work on all 
grids that use the HG services.

Or maybe it's too early and I'm missing what your feature request is?

</I>&gt;<i> I have a feature request for Hypergrid ( It might be possible for me

</I>&gt;<i> The feature request is as follows.
</I>&gt;<i> When items transfer from one grid to another via Hypergrid, the asset 
</I>&gt;<i> gets marked with the user that created the object, and the grid that 
</I>&gt;<i> it was originally on (if it isn't already filled).     The benefit of 
</I>&gt;<i> this feature is that in the editor panel and detailed object 
</I>&gt;<i> information panel, you would know immediately what user created it on 
</I>&gt;<i> what grid.
</I>&gt;<i> This would do two things...    it would allow easier tracking of item 
</I>&gt;<i> transfer...        and it would promote the originating grid giving 
</I>&gt;<i> the originating grid a reason to enable hypergrid..     free props 
</I>&gt;<i> from content shares.     It would add to the social aspect of content 
</I>&gt;<i> sharing by giving content creator props where due.      As far as the 
</I>&gt;<i> technical means to do it..     I propose a one-time fill text field 
</I>&gt;<i> that contains creator deriviative history (I was thinking just one 
</I>&gt;<i> level... but if it's doable, it might be better to have more(such as 
</I>&gt;<i> an object 'git or SVN log').   The Grid Information can come from the 
</I>&gt;<i> GridInfo service that has become fairly prevalent.    The addition of 
</I>&gt;<i> that extra information would, again, provide users with a reason to 
</I>&gt;<i> share content across the hypergrid, provide a grid a reason to allow 
</I>&gt;<i> content to be shared across the hypergrid...    and origin information 
</I>&gt;<i> from the object that would be invaluable for object inspection.
</I>&gt;<i> Let me know what you think..   what the technical hurdles are..    or 
</I>&gt;<i> whatever else is on your mind about it!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks and Best Regards
</I>&gt;<i> Teravus
