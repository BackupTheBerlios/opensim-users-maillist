<PRE>Hi,

Closed source means that it's not trivially possible to modify the
tool to assume the open policy for all grids and then put the
modified tool in the wild for all and sundry to abuse.
Most existing tools are either hacking tools sold through dubious
channels, difficult to use or lack important features. There is to
this day no free, widely available, open source, easy to use content
ripping tool. Your project is bound to become that tool if it is
released as open source.

</I>
No closed grid will ever be able to provide direct asset service
connections because these also allow to extract any and all content,
in full quality and without restrictions. This would include script
sources - an unacceptable situation.
