<PRE>Christina,

You may have several different problems.

First, there is no &quot;standard&quot; volume for uploaded files.  I even have 
problems with some normal mp3's in iTunes

  You may need to increase the volume of your sounds and reload them.    
Most people I know use a wonderful free product called Audacity to do 
that sort of tweaking.  I've had to increase volume of files many times.
<A HREF="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">http://audacity.sourceforge.net/</A>

(side note - If you ever want to use audacity to make mp3 files, you 
also need a separate download it tells you about.)
If you get to that point, it's easy to use audacity to really boost the 
volume of your clips and see if that helps.

So, one question I'd ask is whether you can hear OTHER sounds, and 
whether other people can hear the sounds YOU uploaded.   Both of those 
tests can help pin down whether the problems are at the server end or 
the client end, or both.

First test any YouTube video with soft music to be sure your local 
machine volume is working properly on both clients.
The Moonlight Sonata is a good test. I like this version: 
<A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6txOvK-mAk">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6txOvK-mAk</A>

It's remarkably easy to inadvertently alter or even mute the local 
machine's volume control.   Even when you have it set correctly, 
ill-behaved products such as Skype can change your volume and leave it 
changed when you exit them.
Microsoft operating systems have a number of hidden ways they try to be 
&quot;helpful&quot; that interfere with sound in non-obvious ways, both output and 
mike-input.

Make sure you shove EVERY slider on your audio preferences panel to the 
far right for testing this sort of thing, to eliminate that as a 
confounding problem.

The script commands PLAY and LOOP, or whatever they are,  both have 
their own volume option -- make sure it's set to the maximum. (1.0 ?? I 
forget right now.)

Summary:
       (1)  test to see if you can hear the Moonlight Sonata equally 
loud on each computer.   If not, investigate and fix
             the issues that have nothing to do with your clip or 
OpenSim.  Don't forget to look for muted output and
             unplugged cables.

       (2)  See if other people can hear your clips in OpenSim.  If they 
can, and you can't, the problem is not with the
             clips but with some other settings on your own preferences.

       (3)  Confirm you can hear sounds in general and other clips that 
other people can hear in OpenSim.  If not,
             you still have preferences set wrong, probably, on both 
computers.

       (4)  If you and everyone still think your clips are too soft,   
try boosting their volume in Audacity and
              re-uploading them.

        (5)  If none of that works,  post again here.  I'll be curious 
to know where the problems were.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you in advance.
