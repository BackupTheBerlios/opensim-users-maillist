<PRE>Hi

Before this gets out of hand, let me clarify, this is not a backup tool, at
least no per se, one of the features is the ability to backup content from
an existing account (a backup which is governed by a policy).

The primary goal of the project is to move the inventory and the assets to
their rightful users and to empower the users to use the assets as they
want - within legal limits.

In an ideal world - except for special cases, the inventory and the assets
backing the inventory is controlled by the user, and that is the goal of
the project, to bring the inventory under the control of the user.

To this purpose it currently has two input streams supporting it (one more
is planned), the first is client side access to .iar files, the second is
download from the users existing inventory, to the extent allowed by law
and agreements made between the user and grid operators.

Knowing that only a few of the grid operators using Open Sim has policies
in place, this email serves as an invitation to make these policies public,
and to implement - to the extent possible - these policies in MyInventory.

The question of attribution is only relevant when the assets are being
distributed, MyInventory has currently no functionality for distribution.
The as yet unfinished and only hinted at third input stream deals with
distribution. The current implementation does not distribute any data, it
only grants a user simpler way access to the assets the user has rightfully
access to.

Best regards
Snowcrash

</I>&gt;<i> would need to be virtually (heh) universal, or have a default that was
</I>&gt;<i> agreed upon. A mantis for this feature request on the server side of things

</I>&gt;<i> effort. You'd at least want those viewers with specific support for
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSimulator on board (Kokua, Zen, Firestorm, Teapot, Singularity, Cool
</I>&gt;<i> VL, and Radegast all come to mind). There will of course be legacy viewers
</I>&gt;<i> (like Imprudence and Phoenix) hanging around that may not ever get patched
</I>&gt;<i> for it, necessitating the need for the legally safest export flag default.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Things can get even messier. Even with an export flag, will this software
</I>&gt;<i> preserve the creator name when the content is exported to another grid?
</I>&gt;<i> More than a few licenses require attribution to be preserved. Will it allow
</I>&gt;<i> upload to a grid or standalone where permissions have been disabled? I'm
</I>&gt;<i> sure many content creators would be unhappy to hear they could be. With
</I>&gt;<i> more caffeine in me, I might think of a few more important questions, and I
</I>&gt;<i> have no doubt that others who follow this list will be able to supply them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't want to give the impression here than I'm against the idea that a
</I>&gt;<i> user should be able to backup their inventory. I would opine that most
</I>&gt;<i> users would love this ability, and that many would respect creator's
</I>&gt;<i> rights. But many of those same users want their copyrights and licenses
</I>&gt;<i> respected as the law requires, and steps taken by software like this to
</I>&gt;<i> ensure this was so.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The reason StoredInventory is closed source and very restrictive is

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The risks in making such a tool open source is that any restrictions

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in effect the ultimate copybot.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The people who made StoredInventory were particularly worried about

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This may result in SL suing the program creators as well as the

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Exporting content not licensed for export, or protected by a grid's

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My advice is to consult a lawyer at your place of residence, as in

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Hi
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I've been working on a client side tool for decentralizing user
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> inventories, which I will release as an open source tool in two weeks,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> some
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> of the features may be relevant to grid operators.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The basic premise of the tool is that the inventory and the backing
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> assets
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> of the inventory items really should be controlled by the user. The tool
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> born out of a frustration of having visited a number of grids. Each visit
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to a new grid presents me with an empty inventory, and I can then spend
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> time searching for suitable item, clothing, attachments and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> other accessories.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> For this purpose I have created a tool which will allow me to backup my
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> inventory to a local cache and then upload the contents to another grid.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If my tool becomes popular, both the upload and download mechanisms may
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> have some impact on the grid-operators, hence this email to serve as a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> notice.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The basic architecture is pretty simple, consisting of a number of import
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> agents, which can import the users inventory and backing assets to a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> local
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> database, and a number of upload agents which can upload inventory
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> content
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to a specific account.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Backup/Import
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> There are two import agents, one which will import .iar files and one
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> which
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> works very much like I believe &quot;Stored Inventory&quot; works, which can backup
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the inventory of an avatars inventory. Avatar backup/Import is governed
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> by
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> a policy. Currently there are two policies, one complying with a very
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> restrictive interpretation of the Linden Labs policy on backups, and a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> completely unrestricted policy, where anything that can be downloaded
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> will
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> be downloaded.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> When a new account is registered in MyInventory it checks if the account
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> for a Linden Lab grid and limits the choices of policies to policies
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> suitable for LL's TOS, I cannot and do not know if other grids have
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> similar
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> policies, I can well imagine that Avination has a similar restrictions,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> would like similar logic implemented to restrict the download. Any grid
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> operator which would like to have backup governed by a more restrictive
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> policy are invited to notify me and I will attempt to implement the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> policy
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> prior to the first release of the source code. or supply patches at a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> later
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> time.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Upload/Export
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> MyInventory supports two mechanisms for uploading inventory
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> content, traditional upload using UDP/CAPS and direct access to the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> inventory and asset web-services.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Due to limitations in the UDP/CAPS protocol each upload will create new
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> assets, and as of my latest read of the Open Simulator code the asset
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> store
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> does not support &quot;single instance assets&quot;, i.e. it does not use a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> checksum
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to verify if the asset already exists, for this reason MyInventory
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> prefers
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to upload using direct access to asset and inventory web-services.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I would propose that the grids which chooses to support MyInventory
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> augment
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> their &quot;GridInfoService&quot; entries with the url's for the asset and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> inventory
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> web-services, e.g.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> [GridInfoService]
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>      assets = <A HREF="http://assets.osgrid.org">http://assets.osgrid.org</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>      inventory = <A HREF="http://inventory.osgrid.org">http://inventory.osgrid.org</A>
