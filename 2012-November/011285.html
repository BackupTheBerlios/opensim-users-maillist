<PRE>Hello Snowcrash,

I think it is good having software to backup your items but....
As melanie sayed before, the ability to backup &quot;Any&quot; item would not be a good idea as your software will be banned from major grids due to this.
To be honest we would also blacklist your software if we think it can be at harm for the creators in our grid.

Please think if this:
Most people can not make a &quot;copybot vieuwer&quot; as the things people need for that are available but also complicated to build if you dont have any experiance.
If your software is easy to compile without any knowledge it will be a base for people to create these &quot;copybot's&quot; with.
This will not be the best advertisment for your software in my believe.
 
I think it will be best not to make it an opensource project .. but just distribute only in binary form.
Also making it TPV compliant will be even better.
If it protects content from beeing ilegaly copied on &quot;any grid&quot; we will support it for sure.

Just my two cents ...

Best regards,

Martin Forster

  Subject: [Opensim-users] Announcement of inventory tool (MyInventory), mostly of interest to grid operators/grid nauts


  Hi


  I've been working on a client side tool for decentralizing user inventories, which I will release as an open source tool in two weeks, some of the features may be relevant to grid operators.


  The basic premise of the tool is that the inventory and the backing assets of the inventory items really should be controlled by the user. The tool is born out of a frustration of having visited a number of grids. Each visit to a new grid presents me with an empty inventory, and I can then spend time searching for suitable item, clothing, attachments and other accessories.


  For this purpose I have created a tool which will allow me to backup my inventory to a local cache and then upload the contents to another grid.


  If my tool becomes popular, both the upload and download mechanisms may have some impact on the grid-operators, hence this email to serve as a notice.


  The basic architecture is pretty simple, consisting of a number of import agents, which can import the users inventory and backing assets to a local database, and a number of upload agents which can upload inventory content to a specific account.


  Backup/Import
  There are two import agents, one which will import .iar files and one which works very much like I believe &quot;Stored Inventory&quot; works, which can backup the inventory of an avatars inventory. Avatar backup/Import is governed by a policy. Currently there are two policies, one complying with a very restrictive interpretation of the Linden Labs policy on backups, and a completely unrestricted policy, where anything that can be downloaded will be downloaded.


  When a new account is registered in MyInventory it checks if the account is for a Linden Lab grid and limits the choices of policies to policies suitable for LL's TOS, I cannot and do not know if other grids have similar policies, I can well imagine that Avination has a similar restrictions, and would like similar logic implemented to restrict the download. Any grid operator which would like to have backup governed by a more restrictive policy are invited to notify me and I will attempt to implement the policy prior to the first release of the source code. or supply patches at a later time.


  Upload/Export
  MyInventory supports two mechanisms for uploading inventory content, traditional upload using UDP/CAPS and direct access to the inventory and asset web-services.
  Due to limitations in the UDP/CAPS protocol each upload will create new assets, and as of my latest read of the Open Simulator code the asset store does not support &quot;single instance assets&quot;, i.e. it does not use a checksum to verify if the asset already exists, for this reason MyInventory prefers to upload using direct access to asset and inventory web-services.


  I would propose that the grids which chooses to support MyInventory augment their &quot;GridInfoService&quot; entries with the url's for the asset and inventory web-services, e.g.


  [GridInfoService]
      assets = <A HREF="http://assets.osgrid.org">http://assets.osgrid.org</A>
      inventory = <A HREF="http://inventory.osgrid.org">http://inventory.osgrid.org</A>


  Best regards
  Snowcrash
