Okay, I have now created Mantis 6412 [1] for investigation of this issue.

I have just today made some fixes so that updates to folder inventory versions stored by OpenSimulator now match those 
assumed by the viewers and stored in its cache.  Previously, version folder number was only correctly incremented on 
item add, whereas the viewer was also expecting updates on item move/remove and folder create/remove/move.  If the 
folder version stored by the viewer was greater than that reported by the simulator, the viewer would dump its cached 
information.

Now that the numbers match, the viewer no longer dumps this information.  I'm hoping that this will lead to much more 
use of the inventory cache viewer-side and reduce the number of inventory requests.  It also appears to resolve an issue 
where updates of the &quot;Current Outfit&quot; folder via external mechanisms (or perhaps another viewer) would not show up in 
the viewer until 2 relogs or a cache clear.

So as I know you follow the master code, Ai, could you test this and see if it has an impact?  This will need a ROBUST 
update, and so will not be live on osgrid until the services are updated there, but if I remember you've also seen this 
on your own grid.  To have an effect, as above, it may require 2 viewer relogs and/or a cache clear.
