<PRE>Hi Chris,

Well said. Your description of a legitimate use is spot on. Certainly there
can be illegitimate uses, but that in and of itself doesn't negate the fact
that legitimate uses exist. If I create a thing on my grid, and this tool
allows me to take that thing over to Fleep's grid, that seems pretty
legitimate to me.

A tool that allows for the convenient management of allowable inventory
across grids is sorely needed. That a users things should travel with the
user seems to my tiny brain as being a no-brainer :-).

&gt;<i> Regarding legitimate use cases:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It would be a perfectly legitimate use for someone to download any and all
</I>&gt;<i> content they have received on FleepGrid and then import that content into
</I>&gt;<i> any other grid.  Every item available to another user via $0 sale or &quot;take
</I>&gt;<i> a copy&quot; on my grid is CC licensed for such use (to the best of my
</I>&gt;<i> knowledge) and there would be nothing illegal, immoral, or unethical about
</I>&gt;<i> it.  In fact, I encourage it!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Likewise, it would be a perfectly legitimate use for someone to download
</I>&gt;<i> all 500+ items I have created and listed on the FleepGrid webshop, which
</I>&gt;<i> are primarily in IAR format, and then upload those items to any other grid.
</I>&gt;<i>  Right now, as far as I know, the only way to do that is through console
</I>&gt;<i> access, which means only grid owners can really use the items I put on the
</I>&gt;<i> web, not end users.  That's due to a technical limitation of existing
</I>&gt;<i> tools, not my intent.  My intent is for anyone to be able to use them.  If
</I>&gt;<i> I understand Snowcrash's description correctly, his tool would make that
</I>&gt;<i> possible for any end user of a grid, which in fact would not only be a
</I>&gt;<i> legitimate use of the tool, but a wonderful and extremely helpful addition
</I>&gt;<i> for those of us who opensource our content and make it available in IAR
</I>&gt;<i> format for transport.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I really don't mean to beat a dead horse, but those are legitimate uses.
</I>&gt;<i>  To say there is NO legitimate use of such a tool is simply not true.  What
</I>&gt;<i> is true is that there could be both legitimate and illegitimate uses.  And
</I>&gt;<i> I agree Snowcrash and any other developers should do their very best to
</I>&gt;<i> safeguard against that where possible.  But you can't argue that no
</I>&gt;<i> legitimate use case exists because I've just given several.  My desire to
</I>&gt;<i> create content and share it freely with whoever wants to use it is as
</I>&gt;<i> legitimate as any other content creator's desires, and ditto for any
</I>&gt;<i> law-abiding end user who wishes to use that content in an easy, convenient,
</I>&gt;<i> legal way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regarding the concept of &quot;my inventory&quot; (lowercase):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree with Snowcrash that the concept of &quot;my inventory&quot; is the mental
</I>&gt;<i> construct that the vast majority of virtual world users have. Once I have
</I>&gt;<i> personally verified the license of an opensource item and have gained
</I>&gt;<i> access to it (currently by downloading the IAR or XML file to my local
</I>&gt;<i> computer), then I consider that file to be &quot;mine&quot; (or my licensed copy if
</I>&gt;<i> you prefer) to use as I wish, on any grid I wish.  The creator said I
</I>&gt;<i> could.  Great!  Except the ability to actually use that item on any grid I
</I>&gt;<i> wish requires me to upload it over and over each time I go to a new grid.
</I>&gt;<i>  And for IAR items, the only portable format that fully preserves an item,
</I>&gt;<i> I can only upload it if I have console access to the simulator - which of
</I>&gt;<i> course I do not have access to on any grids but my own.  That is not an
</I>&gt;<i> ideal situation at all.  I have an inventory of stuff that is mine to use,
</I>&gt;<i> my inventory, but using it on every grid I visit is at the moment an
</I>&gt;<i> exceedingly cumbersome process at best, and maybe not even possible at all
</I>&gt;<i> unless I have console access.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A tool that would allow me to upload all the legally licensed XML and IAR
</I>&gt;<i> files I am currently storing on my local computer to a third party service,
</I>&gt;<i> that would hold those files for me, and then magically import them into any
</I>&gt;<i> grid I visit without me having to manually do it item by item myself would
</I>&gt;<i> be a godsend - and perfectly legal, legitimate, ethical, and proper.  I
</I>&gt;<i> know every XML and IAR file on my local computer is licensed for such use
</I>&gt;<i> and I would use such a tool with no hesitation at all, and would probably
</I>&gt;<i> want to kiss the developer who made it because it would save me an enormous
</I>&gt;<i> amount of time and effort.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regarding third party inventory services:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So let's say 20 reputable opensource content creators got together and
</I>&gt;<i> decided to pool our resources to make a repository of content available,
</I>&gt;<i> and we each had 500 items to contribute. Think Linda Kellie, who has the
</I>&gt;<i> most open permissions of any Opensim creator I know, or Vanish Seriath of
</I>&gt;<i> Opensim Creations, etc. So now we have a repository of 10,000 items that
</I>&gt;<i> are legally licensed from trusted sources that can be used on any grid.
</I>&gt;<i>  Would you really argue the ideal situation is that each user should
</I>&gt;<i> manually download each item from that repository and then each user should
</I>&gt;<i> manually upload each item to each and every grid every time they want to
</I>&gt;<i> use something from it?  Surely not, that's crazy.  But that's pretty much
</I>&gt;<i> the current situation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The ideal situation would be to have my inventory of legally licensed
</I>&gt;<i> freebie and purchased content (if it was licensed for such use) hosted not
</I>&gt;<i> on each grid, but somewhere else, and accessible to me no matter what grid
</I>&gt;<i> I travel to without me having to do any uploading at all. When I log on to
</I>&gt;<i> a grid, some established protocol talks to my inventory (or inventories, I
</I>&gt;<i> can imagine multiple services/sources), displays it as a folder when I open
</I>&gt;<i> my inventory in the GUI, and makes a local copy of an item only when I rez
</I>&gt;<i> it out into the world, or wear it, or whatever.  Or something like that.
</I>&gt;<i>  For freebie licensed content, perhaps grids subscribe to the third party
</I>&gt;<i> inventory repository and provide it as a folder in the library for every
</I>&gt;<i> user of their grid, or.. I dunno!  I can imagine many permutations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am not a developer, so I don't fully understand all the mechanisms and
</I>&gt;<i> protocols that exist or could exist to make that kind of  functionality
</I>&gt;<i> possible.  But in general, it seems like Snowcrash's tool is trying to
</I>&gt;<i> implement some version of that concept, and I for one am very interested in
</I>&gt;<i> seeing how it might be implemented in a legal and ethical way. It would
</I>&gt;<i> solve what I view as one of the biggest obstacles to Opensim adoption -
</I>&gt;<i> lack of easy availability and portability of known, legally licensed,
</I>&gt;<i> trusted content.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regarding opensource content creators and the need for better mechanisms
</I>&gt;<i> to share opensource content:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think Linda, Vanish, and I might be three largest web-based opensource
</I>&gt;<i> content providers at the moment, but there may be more that I don't know
</I>&gt;<i> about.  I obviously can't speak for them, but for myself, I spend an
</I>&gt;<i> _enormous_ amount of time, energy, and what amateur skill I possess not
</I>&gt;<i> just making items for the community, but countless additional hours
</I>&gt;<i> packaging them up, indexing them, loading them onto a website, and doing my
</I>&gt;<i> best to make it easy for people to actually port them wherever they want
</I>&gt;<i> and _use_ them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since I am not a coder or a programmer, I unfortunately can't contribute
</I>&gt;<i> to the development of the Opensim code itself.  Creating openly licensed
</I>&gt;<i> content represents my attempt to contribute to the Opensim community in
</I>&gt;<i> another way.  Which is why it is quite sad to me that for all the countless
</I>&gt;<i> hours of effort I've dedicated to making these resources available to
</I>&gt;<i> people, in the hopes of making a significant positive contribution to the
</I>&gt;<i> Opensim community, the current technical limitations prevents the vast
</I>&gt;<i> majority of end users from being able to use my content at all!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If Snowcrash is trying to resolve that problem, I am behind that effort
</I>&gt;<i> 100%, even if I share everyone's concerns about illegitimate uses and the
</I>&gt;<i> need to protect others rights, and sincerely hope that those issues and
</I>&gt;<i> concerns can be addressed, too.  But I can't agree there's no legitimate
</I>&gt;<i> need or use for a tool such as this - from my perspective, there is in fact
</I>&gt;<i> a great need for it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> . . .
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I do apologize, both for the tl;dr length of this post and because I've
</I>&gt;<i> posted an awful lot in this thread, far more than I usually do. Clearly I
</I>&gt;<i> feel passionately about the topic.  Maybe I'll try to take a backseat for a
</I>&gt;<i> bit to make sure I'm not drowning out other voices and to think more about
</I>&gt;<i> all of the possible implications of a tool with this functionality.  And
</I>&gt;<i> while, for the purposes of this discussion, I am taking a strong position
</I>&gt;<i> on the potential benefits for opensource creators and law-abiding end
</I>&gt;<i> users, I hope it's clear that I genuinely understand, respect, and agree
</I>&gt;<i> with many of the concerns that have been raised as well.  I want all
</I>&gt;<i> content creators' and grid owners' rights to be respected, not just my own.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sincerely,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Chris/Fleep
