I am not surprised by the title of this post... as my own situation 
in reporting the issues all coincided with me switching to using 
Firestorm (and Dolphin a bit) whereas before that I had recently only 
used almost exclusively LL official 3.x  viewers.  I also did a 
revamp of our OSGrid add on 0.7.5 dev regions to switch to a new 
dedicated host with MySQL for its DB rather than SQLite too.  So its 
difficult to know what the cause is or causes are... but something is 
definitely not quite right and the issue(s) can really seriously jam 
up regions even when a sole user has logged off for some time, or a 
single user is trying to get back in after a jam up.

It sounds like those of us using the most recent viewers based on LL 
3.3.x just before it stopped supporting OpenSim may not be getting 
helpful results to report if the HTTP inventory CAPS fall back 
mechanism is also broken in some TPVs based on LL 3.3.x code (like 
Firestorm and Dolphin?)

I will try to watch for recurrent symptoms and report what I can as 
the Mantis entry is filed and others home in on the issue.
