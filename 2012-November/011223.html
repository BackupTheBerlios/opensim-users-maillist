<PRE>Apparently, the extra entries are for more efficient upload. Unless
a grid specifies the policy they want, open download and the
inefficient upload mechanism will be in effect for it.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I've been working on a client side tool for decentralizing user 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> inventories, which I will release as an open source tool in two weeks, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> some of the features may be relevant to grid operators.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The basic premise of the tool is that the inventory and the backing 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> assets of the inventory items really should be controlled by the user. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The tool is born out of a frustration of having visited a number of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> grids. Each visit to a new grid presents me with an empty inventory, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and I can then spend time searching for suitable item, clothing, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> attachments and other accessories.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For this purpose I have created a tool which will allow me to backup 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> my inventory to a local cache and then upload the contents to another 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> grid.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If my tool becomes popular, both the upload and download mechanisms 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> may have some impact on the grid-operators, hence this email to serve 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as a notice.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The basic architecture is pretty simple, consisting of a number of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> import agents, which can import the users inventory and backing assets 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to a local database, and a number of upload agents which can upload 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> inventory content to a specific account.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Backup/Import
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There are two import agents, one which will import .iar files and one 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which works very much like I believe &quot;Stored Inventory&quot; works, which 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can backup the inventory of an avatars inventory. Avatar backup/Import 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is governed by a policy. Currently there are two policies, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one complying with a very restrictive interpretation of the Linden 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Labs policy on backups, and a completely unrestricted policy, where 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> anything that can be downloaded will be downloaded.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> When a new account is registered in MyInventory it checks if the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> account is for a Linden Lab grid and limits the choices of policies to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> policies suitable for LL's TOS, I cannot and do not know if other 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> grids have similar policies, I can well imagine that Avination has a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> similar restrictions, and would like similar logic implemented to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> restrict the download. Any grid operator which would like to have 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> backup governed by a more restrictive policy are invited to notify me 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and I will attempt to implement the policy prior to the first release 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of the source code. or supply patches at a later time.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Upload/Export
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> MyInventory supports two mechanisms for uploading inventory 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> content, traditional upload using UDP/CAPS and direct access to the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> inventory and asset web-services.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Due to limitations in the UDP/CAPS protocol each upload will create 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> new assets, and as of my latest read of the Open Simulator code the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> asset store does not support &quot;single instance assets&quot;, i.e. it does 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not use a checksum to verify if the asset already exists, for this 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reason MyInventory prefers to upload using direct access to asset and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> inventory web-services.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I would propose that the grids which chooses to support MyInventory 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> augment their &quot;GridInfoService&quot; entries with the url's for the asset 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and inventory web-services, e.g.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> [GridInfoService]
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     assets = <A HREF="http://assets.osgrid.org">http://assets.osgrid.org</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     inventory = <A HREF="http://inventory.osgrid.org">http://inventory.osgrid.org</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Best regards
