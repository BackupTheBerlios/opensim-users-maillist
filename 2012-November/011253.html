</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; IANAL! but...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Precisely.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; There is no doubt that the creator owns the copyright, and the user has
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; license to use said item. One of the operative words here is &quot;User&quot; and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;Avatar&quot;, avatars have no legal standing, users do. One of the many
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> issues
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; here is that there is no agreement made between somebody clicking &quot;Pay&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; an object in a virtual world and the one &quot;selling&quot; the object, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thats a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; side issue.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In fact, there is. It's called the Terms Of Service of the grid in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> question and such terms lay out the interpretation of the in world
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> permissions. Those of Second Life and of Avination limit the grant
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of license to the grid of origin. In Second Life, this cannot be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> overridden while Avination allows an explicit, written license to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> export items. Avination will support the &quot;exportable&quot; flag if and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> when it becomes available to allow creators to mark their items as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exportable, however, any item created before the adoption of such a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> flag will default to NOT exportable and the flag default will also
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be NOT exportable.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; This is where I see content creators being in a far better position than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; the Record Industry were back in the zero'es, the pricing on most
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> content
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; is so low that it really isn't worth while to pirate it for the ordinary
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; user. But ease of access is very much an issue in opensim grids.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In fact, ease of access is mostly given in &quot;open&quot; grids like OSGrid.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I disagree with the ease of access, the primary reason why I started this
</I>&gt;<i> project was that I wanted to try out a new grid, and had to spend 2 days
</I>&gt;<i> searching for suitable content for my avatar. The search aren't in place to
</I>&gt;<i> make it easy to find that content, and why should I spend two days
</I>&gt;<i> searching for content when I have a different account on a different grid,
</I>&gt;<i> with content I like? especially since that content is available under CC
</I>&gt;<i> license?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The only thing really missing is a tool that allows upload of .iar
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and possible .oar through a client connection. This is useful for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> people on grids that don't support user connected simulators or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> where the user doesn't have the time/expertise/resources to operate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a simulator.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; This very much depends on the country you live in, in my country I am
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; entitled to use any digital asset I have licensed in any way I see fit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; long as this is done for personal use and I have not made a prior
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> agreement
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; with the distributor to not use the asset in said manner.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As above, that agreement is called the Terms Of Service. Since the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> grid is the distributor, this is a valid and legally binding
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> agreement in any country.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However the TOS is not the end all thing most people believe, in my
</I>&gt;<i> country, the author of the document is very much responsible for making the
</I>&gt;<i> agreement clear, especially for non professional users, if the creator
</I>&gt;<i> cannot make a compelling argument that a clause is necessary and easily
</I>&gt;<i> understandable then it may verywell be disregarded in any court.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But that is really an aside thing, we are talking about content with so
</I>&gt;<i> little monetary value that most courts will disregard the case as too
</I>&gt;<i> trivial, which is even more an aside, since it is not the intention of me
</I>&gt;<i> nor MyInventory to violate anybodies copyright. It is however the intention
</I>&gt;<i> of the tool to empower the user and to grant the user better control of
</I>&gt;<i> content the user has a legal right to control.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I do not agree with you about damaging the opensim community, quite the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; opposite. I see two major obstacles preventing widespread use, one is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> easy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; access to content, and the second is a usable search tool.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The damaging part is the public's impression that OpenSim equals
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> content theft.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The inventory download features works equally well for OpenSim and LL
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> grids, in fact it may work a little better on LL grids since the Folder
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> versioning works a bit more reliable on LL's grids. IMO there is a lot more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> content theft going on on the LL grid, simply because they have a bigger
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> userbase, where as most people currently on opensim based grids are a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> different type of users.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; There is a lot of free content available, either CC licensed or public
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; domain, but until now only grid operators have had access to it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; MyInventory is intended to give the user access to this content without
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; having to be technical savy enough to install and run a simulator.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> See above, such a tool would be a great thing to have.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
