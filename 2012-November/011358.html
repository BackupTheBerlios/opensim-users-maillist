You seem to want to design a collection of user services that run on a 
person's computer, wrapped up in a nice UI. Robust + HG user services 
gives you that, without the UI. You have technical choices that affect 
how the community will perceive your work. If you prefer to 
redesign/reimplement from scratch instead of using what's already been 
designed/implemented, that's your choice. If you prefer to use libomv, 
in order to force grids to open their resources to you, instead of 
giving grid operators options, that's also your choice.

Feedback doesn't seem to be registering.
One final time, good luck!
