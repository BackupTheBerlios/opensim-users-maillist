<PRE>I made the web part of the XmlRpcGridRouter available today. The module 
has been in OpenSim core for some time, but was little known. Http in 
has become very popular for communication with in-world objects since 
it's inception. But, the llRemoteData is still very useful and is fairly 
simple to use. The issue with use in OpenSim has been keeping up with 
all the ip addresses and ports of the simulators containing the objects 
and matching them with their channels. Also, in SecondLife this service 
was very unreliable and was prone to timeouts.

The OpenSim module allows simulators to register the llRemoteData 
channels with an external service that can keep track of the active 
channels and pair them with their simulator's ip and port address. This 
allows a use to setup the external service and point their simulator 
toward the registration uri. As objects request remote data channels, 
they will register with the gateway. External applications use the 
outward facing uri to access any of the registered objects with the 
standard llRemoteData calls. This is not a &quot;grid only&quot; tool. anyone 
managing groups of simulators my take advantage of it to aggregate their 
llRemoteData traffic through a single access point.

As I started updating this for release, I re-wrote it using the same 
xml-rpc library that SecondLife is reported to use and had poor 
performance. as this is a very specific application, I was able to 
remove the library and write at a lower level and have had excellent 
results in testing. Hopefully this will be useful to people looking to 
integrate external applications with their simulators.

Find code, instructions and testing tools at GForge - 
<A HREF="http://forge.opensimulator.org/gf/project/xmlrpcrouter/">http://forge.opensimulator.org/gf/project/xmlrpcrouter/</A> or Github -
