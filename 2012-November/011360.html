<PRE>Hi,

Theft of IP occurs when you obtain copies of IP in ways not licensed
by the creator. This is a criminal offense. Additionally, you incur
civil liability through breach of contract, which is what the TOS
are. In Avination, you cannot log in without accepting the TOS,
which means you have entered into this contract and are bound by it.

Therefore, downloading content from Avination will open you up to
both criminal and civil penalties.

You keep mentioning laws in your country, but that is irrelevant and
immaterial. Most infringers are not from your country. If most
infringers were from a single country, that country could be IP
blocked and we'd have no more problems. Sadly, infringers are all
over and that means that, due to statistical distribution, most
infringers are not covered by your country's laws.

Let me state this here for the record: I do not believe that anyone
here is accusing you personally of infringing copyright. I certainly
do not accuse you of such a thing. We are concerned, as a community,
that your tool will remove a barrier to entry for copybotters. They
will no longer need to learn complex toolsets. That is the risk
we're seeing and that is why some of the posters on this thread have
started thinking aloud about blocking technologies.

I have hinted at it before people started saying it outright - isn't
it better to have an accepted, community-supported tool than to have
a banned tool?
