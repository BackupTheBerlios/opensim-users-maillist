<PRE>I am sorry, I am a bit prone to mood swings, on account of being both, 
an insulin dependent diabetic and after an 8 year wait on dialysis,  I 
am on kidney transplant immune suppressants.  This whole conversation is 
starting to depress the %^&amp;* out of me, wondering if all of this is 
worth my time and money anymore.  When I discovered Opensim, I thought, 
finally I can have enough land to build something impressive.  I once 
built the most important building of Shuri called the Seiden of Shuri in 
a sim called Butler in Secondlife.  Now I could build the entire castle 
on my own grid, and choose a time period and scale.    With enough 
research to build a historically accurate Castle during its golden 
era..  I have researched more then  5 years on this project, only to be 
sure I had enough detail and knowledge of the culture to create what was 
around in the late 16th early 17th century.

  I have been saving money by not eating as well, I lost 32 pounds in 
three months.  It should be another year, or year and a half, to get a 
monster of a server to run it on.   As I save up, prices cme down to 
built a twin AMD 3+ Bulldozers each with 16 cores to run it on.

This conversation has me thinking  only about people stealing my assets, 
makeing me think, why bother.    To me the realease of Snowcrashe's 
software makes it easy for anyone to just freely grab all my work, I 
give on my grid, for use on my grid,  and drag it off someplace, even SL 
to resell and use no matter how I try to protect myself and my work.  
Also from what he said other &quot;black hatters&quot; can do it ANYWAYS.  To me 
this means hours of hand texturing, the hours I spent building, till my 
one good eye gives me such a headache I pop tylonol like candy.

IT takes me more time and effort to do as much as some with only one 
working eye.  I want it to stay here on my grid unless I choose to sell 
it in another grid like Secondlife.  I also don't want my grid a 
16th-17th century grid becoming filled with airplanes and cars and other 
modern items.  Can someone tell me now, why should I even put more work 
into creating this world and taking any more of my life creating 
anything anymore??

InuYasha.

</I>&gt;<i>     Hello Snowcrash,
</I>&gt;<i>     I think it is good having software to backup your items but....
</I>&gt;<i>     As melanie sayed before, the ability to backup &quot;Any&quot; item would
</I>&gt;<i>     not be a good idea as your software will be banned from major
</I>&gt;<i>     grids due to this.
</I>&gt;<i>     To be honest we would also blacklist your software if we think it
</I>&gt;<i>     can be at harm for the creators in our grid.
</I>&gt;<i>     Please think if this:
</I>&gt;<i>     Most people can not make a &quot;copybot vieuwer&quot; as the things people
</I>&gt;<i>     need for that are available but also complicated to build if you
</I>&gt;<i>     dont have any experiance.
</I>&gt;<i>     If your software is easy to compile without any knowledge it will
</I>&gt;<i>     be a base for people to create these &quot;copybot's&quot; with.
</I>&gt;<i>     This will not be the best advertisment for your software in my
</I>&gt;<i>     believe.
</I>&gt;<i>     I think it will be best not to make it an opensource project ..
</I>&gt;<i>     but just distribute only in binary form.
</I>&gt;<i>     Also making it TPV compliant will be even better.
</I>&gt;<i>     If it protects content from beeing ilegaly copied on &quot;any grid&quot; we
</I>&gt;<i>     will support it for sure.
</I>&gt;<i>     Just my two cents ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The backup feature, which really is only a small part of the overall 
</I>&gt;<i> featureset, currently operates in one of two modes, TPV compliant mode 
</I>&gt;<i> and unrestricted mode. MyInventory forces the download component to be 
</I>&gt;<i> TPV compatible when connecting to any known Linden Labs grid (and 
</I>&gt;<i> similar protection is underway for other grids), My original mail had 
</I>&gt;<i> two topics.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Which grids would like to have the same hardcoded protection level 
</I>&gt;<i> against unrestricted download as Linden Labs
</I>&gt;<i> 2) This tool may - if it becomes popular - create a lot of duplicate 
</I>&gt;<i> assets, therefore I came up with a suggestion on how to alleviate this 
</I>&gt;<i> problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Going closed source is simply &quot;security by obscurity&quot; under a 
</I>&gt;<i> different name, the &quot;black hatters&quot; already have the ability to take 
</I>&gt;<i> what they want, claiming that content creators assets are safe is 
</I>&gt;<i> simply not true, and that fact holds for Linden Labs grids as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Even if you decide to block MyInventory, the blocking tools are so 
</I>&gt;<i> inadequate in these days of fast recycling DHCP servers, that all you 
</I>&gt;<i> will manage to do is to block out legitimate users, the &quot;black 
</I>&gt;<i> hatters&quot; can easily get around these limitations. And is that really 
</I>&gt;<i> what you want?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Best regards,
</I>&gt;<i>     Martin Forster

</I>&gt;<i>         (MyInventory), mostly of interest to grid operators/grid nauts
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Hi
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         I've been working on a client side tool for decentralizing
</I>&gt;<i>         user inventories, which I will release as an open source tool
</I>&gt;<i>         in two weeks, some of the features may be relevant to grid
</I>&gt;<i>         operators.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         The basic premise of the tool is that the inventory and the
</I>&gt;<i>         backing assets of the inventory items really should be
</I>&gt;<i>         controlled by the user. The tool is born out of a frustration
</I>&gt;<i>         of having visited a number of grids. Each visit to a new grid
</I>&gt;<i>         presents me with an empty inventory, and I can then spend time
</I>&gt;<i>         searching for suitable item, clothing, attachments and
</I>&gt;<i>         other accessories.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         For this purpose I have created a tool which will allow me to
</I>&gt;<i>         backup my inventory to a local cache and then upload the
</I>&gt;<i>         contents to another grid.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         If my tool becomes popular, both the upload and download
</I>&gt;<i>         mechanisms may have some impact on the grid-operators, hence
</I>&gt;<i>         this email to serve as a notice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         The basic architecture is pretty simple, consisting of a
</I>&gt;<i>         number of import agents, which can import the users inventory
</I>&gt;<i>         and backing assets to a local database, and a number of upload
</I>&gt;<i>         agents which can upload inventory content to a specific account.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Backup/Import
</I>&gt;<i>         There are two import agents, one which will import .iar files
</I>&gt;<i>         and one which works very much like I believe &quot;Stored
</I>&gt;<i>         Inventory&quot; works, which can backup the inventory of an avatars
</I>&gt;<i>         inventory. Avatar backup/Import is governed by a policy.
</I>&gt;<i>         Currently there are two policies, one complying with a very
</I>&gt;<i>         restrictive interpretation of the Linden Labs policy on
</I>&gt;<i>         backups, and a completely unrestricted policy, where anything
</I>&gt;<i>         that can be downloaded will be downloaded.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         When a new account is registered in MyInventory it checks if
</I>&gt;<i>         the account is for a Linden Lab grid and limits the choices of
</I>&gt;<i>         policies to policies suitable for LL's TOS, I cannot and do
</I>&gt;<i>         not know if other grids have similar policies, I can well
</I>&gt;<i>         imagine that Avination has a similar restrictions, and would
</I>&gt;<i>         like similar logic implemented to restrict the download. Any
</I>&gt;<i>         grid operator which would like to have backup governed by a
</I>&gt;<i>         more restrictive policy are invited to notify me and I will
</I>&gt;<i>         attempt to implement the policy prior to the first release of
</I>&gt;<i>         the source code. or supply patches at a later time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Upload/Export
</I>&gt;<i>         MyInventory supports two mechanisms for uploading inventory
</I>&gt;<i>         content, traditional upload using UDP/CAPS and direct access
</I>&gt;<i>         to the inventory and asset web-services.
</I>&gt;<i>         Due to limitations in the UDP/CAPS protocol each upload will
</I>&gt;<i>         create new assets, and as of my latest read of the Open
</I>&gt;<i>         Simulator code the asset store does not support &quot;single
</I>&gt;<i>         instance assets&quot;, i.e. it does not use a checksum to verify if
</I>&gt;<i>         the asset already exists, for this reason MyInventory prefers
</I>&gt;<i>         to upload using direct access to asset and inventory web-services.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         I would propose that the grids which chooses to support
</I>&gt;<i>         MyInventory augment their &quot;GridInfoService&quot; entries with the
</I>&gt;<i>         url's for the asset and inventory web-services, e.g.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         [GridInfoService]
</I>&gt;<i>             assets = <A HREF="http://assets.osgrid.org">http://assets.osgrid.org</A>
</I>&gt;<i>             inventory = <A HREF="http://inventory.osgrid.org">http://inventory.osgrid.org</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Best regards
</I>&gt;<i>         Snowcrash
