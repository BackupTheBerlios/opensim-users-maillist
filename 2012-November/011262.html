<PRE>You make me wish there was a like button on this page.  May I quote some 
of this on my own grid's TOS?

</I>&gt;<i> distribution of tools designed to subvert the rights of content

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are a multitude of ways to resolve these asset sharing/transfer

</I>&gt;<i>      Yes,  we need an easier way to load IAR files....
</I>&gt;<i>                      Why don't you implement this as a first step and 
</I>&gt;<i> start the process of working WITH the community?
</I>&gt;<i>                      (Instead of proclaiming your intent to implement 
</I>&gt;<i> something that requires us to react in a publicly negative way)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      Yes,  we probably need to implement some kind of license tagging 
</I>&gt;<i> to assets to properly identify those place in the PD BY the creator.
</I>&gt;<i>                     Even so,  I lend my voice to the chorus of &quot;IANAL 
</I>&gt;<i> BUT.... I hope you confer with proper legal counsel before you jump 
</I>&gt;<i> off the liability cliff &quot; ....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I hope my response to your request for grid operators to participate 
</I>&gt;<i> in this discussion is clear....
</I>&gt;<i>       I will disconnect and ban anyone who attempts to connect to any 
</I>&gt;<i> of the grids I administer using this tool.
</I>&gt;<i>       I will publicly identify those users and share all the 
</I>&gt;<i> information I am able to collect with all of the operators of any 
</I>&gt;<i> other grid I can communicate with .
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Those of us who have been here a while have seen this all before, and 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm sure we will see it again.
</I>&gt;<i> The response can only be &quot;We do NOT want your tool as designed, we 
</I>&gt;<i> WILL NOT tolerate its use.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> NO, there are NO valid reasons to welcome a tool that incorporates a 
</I>&gt;<i> disregard for an important part of the Opensim community (creators)
</I>&gt;<i> Public pressure was enough to thwart the public release of the last 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;OpenSource sim copy utility&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> I continue to hope that the vocal opposition we expressed as a 
</I>&gt;<i> community to that effort is brought to bear here as well..
