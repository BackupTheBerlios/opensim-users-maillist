</I>Absolutely. Believe me, I'm a huge supporter of user's rights. These 
include things like (as they're known in the U.S.) fair use and first 
sale doctrines. But I ask you not to forget forget that the ability to 
exercise copyright or enter into a contract is *also* a user's right.  
This isn't a &quot;Them against Us&quot; issue. It's an _ALL of us_ issue. 
Fighting for one set of rights while disregarding or undermining other 
rights is not a tenable position.

I've would adore it if someone were to step up and pull people together 
into finally wrangling a framework that allows for people like Fleep to 
share her creations freely across virtual worlds in a user friendly 
format, while also allowing commercial creators to have a reasonable 
expectation of the preservation of their licenses and copyrights. That 
should be the real project here. There's too many missing pieces at the 
moment. Getting an export flag implemented on the server and in viewers, 
although an imperfect solution, would be an excellent way to get the 
ball rolling.

Any other action, I think, will tend to be perceived as a, &quot;I want what 
I want, and I want it now, damn the consequences,&quot; response to the 
community, whether or not that perception is warranted.
