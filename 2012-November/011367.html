</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Theft is a criminal act punishable by law, and illegal acquisition or

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Theft of IP occurs when you obtain copies of IP in ways not licensed
</I>&gt;<i> by the creator.
</I>
I believed I covered that with &quot;illegal acquisition&quot;.

&gt;<i> This is a criminal offense. Additionally, you incur
</I>&gt;<i> civil liability through breach of contract, which is what the TOS
</I>&gt;<i> are. In Avination, you cannot log in without accepting the TOS,
</I>&gt;<i> which means you have entered into this contract and are bound by it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Avination is not the only grid out there!

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, downloading content from Avination will open you up to
</I>&gt;<i> both criminal and civil penalties.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You keep mentioning laws in your country, but that is irrelevant and
</I>&gt;<i> immaterial.
</I>
They are very relevant to me, and to users who are governed by similar law,
trying to cover everything through the lowest common denominator doesn't
work, and you know it!

&gt;<i> Most infringers are not from your country. If most
</I>&gt;<i> infringers were from a single country, that country could be IP
</I>&gt;<i> blocked and we'd have no more problems. Sadly, infringers are all
</I>&gt;<i> over and that means that, due to statistical distribution, most
</I>&gt;<i> infringers are not covered by your country's laws.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let me state this here for the record: I do not believe that anyone
</I>&gt;<i> here is accusing you personally of infringing copyright. I certainly
</I>&gt;<i> do not accuse you of such a thing. We are concerned, as a community,
</I>&gt;<i> that your tool will remove a barrier to entry for copybotters. They
</I>&gt;<i> will no longer need to learn complex toolsets. That is the risk
</I>&gt;<i> we're seeing and that is why some of the posters on this thread have
</I>&gt;<i> started thinking aloud about blocking technologies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have hinted at it before people started saying it outright - isn't
</I>&gt;<i> it better to have an accepted, community-supported tool than to have
</I>&gt;<i> a banned tool?
