<PRE>Actually,  as the creator of an item I own it.  Not the &quot;user&quot;.  That's
clear  because I get to set the permissions under which the next &quot;owner&quot; or
licensee can use it.  When someone acquires an digital asset I created they
get a license to use it.  The value of the creation itself usually far
exceeds what someone pays for it.   I only create in grids I trust because
the grid operator must defend my rights via a DMCA process.  So no a &quot;user&quot;
doesn't have rights to copy items in inventory they &quot;own&quot;.  Because
ownership of digital assets doesn't transfer.  Only a license to use them
for a purpose.

 

So in short I think some of your thinking about users &quot;rights&quot; is somewhat
flawed.  That doesn't meant there aren't protocols to do what you want to
do.   But yeah, I think providing such a tool is asking to get sued. And it
probably damages the reputation of OpenSim as serious software for serving
digital assets.  That's a shame because there are a number of closed grids
trying to actually correct that assumption by providing a more secure
environment for content creators to operate in.  

 

Just my 2 cents.  Do what you will with it

 

Mike

Hi

 

Before this gets out of hand, let me clarify, this is not a backup tool, at
least no per se, one of the features is the ability to backup content from
an existing account (a backup which is governed by a policy).

 

The primary goal of the project is to move the inventory and the assets to
their rightful users and to empower the users to use the assets as they want
- within legal limits.

 

In an ideal world - except for special cases, the inventory and the assets
backing the inventory is controlled by the user, and that is the goal of the
project, to bring the inventory under the control of the user.

 

To this purpose it currently has two input streams supporting it (one more
is planned), the first is client side access to .iar files, the second is
download from the users existing inventory, to the extent allowed by law and
agreements made between the user and grid operators.

 

Knowing that only a few of the grid operators using Open Sim has policies in
place, this email serves as an invitation to make these policies public, and
to implement - to the extent possible - these policies in MyInventory.

 

The question of attribution is only relevant when the assets are being
distributed, MyInventory has currently no functionality for distribution.
The as yet unfinished and only hinted at third input stream deals with
distribution. The current implementation does not distribute any data, it
only grants a user simpler way access to the assets the user has rightfully
access to.

 

Best regards

Snowcrash
