<PRE>Well, to clarify, a user _may_ have rights to copy items in their inventory
from one grid to another, but they also may not  - it all depends on the
individual license for the individual item.

In the current server/viewer schema, the Copy/Mod/Transfer permissions
preserved in the object edit window indicates a limited license applicable
_only_ to the grid where the item originated, as far as I understand. This
is the source of much confusion as many people interpret Copy/Mod/Trans
permissions as a license applying to any grid, but it doesn't, it only
applies to the grid where the item originated.

An item creator can also make a separate license that applies permissions
for other grids, which may give a user permission to copy the item to other
grids, but the problem is, there's no mechanism to record that license and
reliably attach the additional license to the item.  Sticking a notecard in
the item's contents is not a reliable method since it can simply be
deleted, or in the case of an Imprudence type xml import/export, lost even
unintentionally.

Until the server/viewer schema supports the preservation of explicit
licensing options for more than the originating grid (the most popular
suggestion seems to be adding an &quot;exportable&quot; checkbox to the existing
C/M/T scheme), I'm afraid we'll continue to be stuck in this murky state
where no one is entirely sure of the provenance of any item except for the
items they have created themselves, and no one really knows which items are
licensed for copy to other grids and which aren't.

It's an unhappy state of affairs for everyone, right now, IMO.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi****
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ** **
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Before this gets out of hand, let me clarify, this is not a backup
</I>&gt;<i> tool, at least no per se, one of the features is the ability to backup
</I>&gt;<i> content from an existing account (a backup which is governed by a policy).
</I>&gt;<i> ****
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ** **
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The primary goal of the project is to move the inventory and the assets to
</I>&gt;<i> their rightful users and to empower the users to use the assets as they
</I>&gt;<i> want - within legal limits.****
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ** **
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In an ideal world - except for special cases, the inventory and the assets
</I>&gt;<i> backing the inventory is controlled by the user, and that is the goal of
</I>&gt;<i> the project, to bring the inventory under the control of the user.****
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ** **
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To this purpose it currently has two input streams supporting it (one more
</I>&gt;<i> is planned), the first is client side access to .iar files, the second is
</I>&gt;<i> download from the users existing inventory, to the extent allowed by law
</I>&gt;<i> and agreements made between the user and grid operators.****
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ** **
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Knowing that only a few of the grid operators using Open Sim has policies
</I>&gt;<i> in place, this email serves as an invitation to make these policies public,
</I>&gt;<i> and to implement - to the extent possible - these policies in MyInventory.
</I>&gt;<i> ****
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ** **
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The question of attribution is only relevant when the assets are being
</I>&gt;<i> distributed, MyInventory has currently no functionality for distribution.
</I>&gt;<i> The as yet unfinished and only hinted at third input stream deals with
</I>&gt;<i> distribution. The current implementation does not distribute any data, it
</I>&gt;<i> only grants a user simpler way access to the assets the user has rightfully
</I>&gt;<i> access to.****
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ** **
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best regards****
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Snowcrash****
