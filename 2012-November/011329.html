Search widely differs between grids. Some have good search, like my
grid, Avination, for instance, which fully supports search on the
same level as SL.

As for backing up - if it's something you purchased, you are not
supposed to possess an independent copy. All grids known to me that
have commerce license content for that grid only. If that grid
closes, your license lapses. That is by design. If you don't like
that, you are not required to spend money. Many people do purchase
because they have trust in the longevity of their grid. According to
TOS on the commercial grids, the act of creating a backup of a
purchased item is already infringing the TOS.

But it should not be &quot;hurt the community first, talk later.&quot;
