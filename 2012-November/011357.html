&gt;<i> Hi,

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; If the items belong to the user. Purchased items do not belong tot
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; he user. They belong to the creator and continue to belong to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; creator, being licensed only for use on the one grid where they were
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; purchased (licensed). Allowing these items to travel is called
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &quot;copyright infringement&quot;, or, more often, &quot;theft.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Whether this is theft or not really depends on how you define the term
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;distribution&quot;. Unfortunately I have not seen a single consistent
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; definition of this term used, neither in the practical world nor in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; legislation governing ip rights, especially in the context of the
</I>&gt;<i> internet.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's not about distribution. That is a whole other kettle of fish.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Whether copying an item I have licensed but not created from the personal
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; inventory of one of my accounts to another is distribution, or merely
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; moving from one personal storage location to another is very much at an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; open question which I doubt has no clear answer in any country.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Transfer from one account to another on the same grid is governed by
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;no copy&quot; permission. Transfer off the grid is not allowed. It
</I>&gt;<i> really is that simple but I'm really getting the impression that you
</I>&gt;<i> don't want to accept that. I understand you'd like reality to be
</I>&gt;<i> different and you'd like users to actually own their inventory
</I>&gt;<i> outright but that s simply not the case. Some TOS restrict items to
</I>&gt;<i> one grid only and don't allow download of items you have not
</I>&gt;<i> yourself created. If you download something you acquired from
</I>&gt;<i> someone else in one of those grids, it is theft. No matter what the
</I>&gt;<i> purpose of the download is.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Melanie
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Theft is a criminal act punishable by law, and illegal acquisition or
distribution of immaterial property (typically IP) is theft, what you are
referring to is &quot;breach of contract&quot; and requires that a contract has been
entered into by both parties. If no contract has been made made - in my
country it must be entered into explicitly - there cannot be a &quot;breach of
contract&quot;.
