<PRE>Retyping because of too many typose, sorry about that

Hi Fleep,
On Why does anyone create anything?
I used to think like you and am a big supporter of Stallman. I have the
experience of wearing the shoes of an academic researcher and a business
owner. I can see things from both angles. It is clear to me that ALL
opensource efforts are subsidized by employers/govt in some shape of form
(one just have to follow the money trail). For folks running a business and
who live squarely on the money they make for the business, it is
understandable that they are defensive about IP. This is not a simple case
of the virtuous who like create and share vs those who don't. It's about
the right to eat or not.
