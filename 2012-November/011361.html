<PRE>Hi Chris,

your grid and others like it are not where the concerns are. It is
very cumbersome to qualify each and every statement to apply only to
commercial/closed grids or commercial/copyrighted items when all
readers are aware that that case is the one being discussed.

This tool poses no threat to open grids and CC licensed content.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So making the statement &quot;Transfer off the grid is not allowed&quot; is simply
</I>&gt;<i> not true.  Transfer off of SOME grids is not allowed.  Some (my guess is
</I>&gt;<i> many) grids DO allow it.  I think what is unusual about FleepGrid as a use
</I>&gt;<i> case is not that I allow transfer off grid, but that everything on my grid
</I>&gt;<i> is CC licensed.  My guess is most typical small grids allow some but not
</I>&gt;<i> all items to be transfered off grid.  But either way, it cannot be said
</I>&gt;<i> that transfering items off of grids is universally forbidden.  Commercial
</I>&gt;<i> and closed grids forbid it.  Many personal, open, or HG connected grids do
</I>&gt;<i> not.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think it's important to keep mentioning the different use cases of small,
</I>&gt;<i> personal, independent grids and not just have everyone keep assuming and
</I>&gt;<i> defaulting to the use cases of the large, commercial, or closed grids.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &quot;copyright infringement&quot;, or, more often, &quot;theft.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Whether this is theft or not really depends on how you define the term
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;distribution&quot;. Unfortunately I have not seen a single consistent
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; definition of this term used, neither in the practical world nor in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; legislation governing ip rights, especially in the context of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> internet.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It's not about distribution. That is a whole other kettle of fish.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Whether copying an item I have licensed but not created from the personal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; inventory of one of my accounts to another is distribution, or merely
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; moving from one personal storage location to another is very much at an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; open question which I doubt has no clear answer in any country.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Transfer from one account to another on the same grid is governed by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the &quot;no copy&quot; permission. Transfer off the grid is not allowed. It
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> really is that simple but I'm really getting the impression that you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> don't want to accept that. I understand you'd like reality to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> different and you'd like users to actually own their inventory
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> outright but that s simply not the case. Some TOS restrict items to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one grid only and don't allow download of items you have not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> yourself created. If you download something you acquired from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> someone else in one of those grids, it is theft. No matter what the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> purpose of the download is.
