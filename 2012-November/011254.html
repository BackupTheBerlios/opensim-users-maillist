<PRE>
I'm not really sure to undertand, but today exist a &quot;viewer&quot; named stored 
inventory (<A HREF="http://secondinventory.com/">http://secondinventory.com/</A>), that can buy the &quot;avatar&quot;, conect 
to a grid, opensim or SecondLife, and save to your hard disk item if you 
have permitions to do, it mean if is fullperms (in sl mus be creator of the 
item), have control of with assets you have in a grid, so don't need 
duplicate assets, if the grid have money it pay for upload, have a lot of 
problems, some times need dowload and upload again becouse fail like .xml 
imprudence, if have access to the console of couse iar is much better, is a 
payed software and work in all world, if can do a best software, i belive 
that if is free or payed is your legimit decition, the copywrite must be 
respected by the software if full perms is enougt or must be just for 
creators, if the software do that the grid managers i belive have not 
problem, but is the software who must show that respect the copyrigth, and 
is not a kind of copybot or incognito, and of course the target must be the 
avatar.

As I read it, it has at the very least the functionality of Second

A .iar uploader that uses a user connection would be a fine tool indeed.

The entries are to facilitate asset deduplication, however, the

&gt;<i> Ideally, your tool would provide enough granular control that a grid

</I>
This is not possible unless the code stays closed source. Open
Source allows to trivially remove such protections and copies of the
software with the protection removed will the be distributed to
people not otherwise capable of doing so, but who have the criminal
energy to copybot in a grand style. That would surely cause the
lawyers to play a role in the matter.

&gt;<i> There is no doubt that the creator owns the copyright, and the user has a

</I>
In fact, there is. It's called the Terms Of Service of the grid in
question and such terms lay out the interpretation of the in world
permissions. Those of Second Life and of Avination limit the grant
of license to the grid of origin. In Second Life, this cannot be
overridden while Avination allows an explicit, written license to
export items. Avination will support the &quot;exportable&quot; flag if and
when it becomes available to allow creators to mark their items as
exportable, however, any item created before the adoption of such a
flag will default to NOT exportable and the flag default will also
be NOT exportable.

&gt;<i> This is where I see content creators being in a far better position than
</I>&gt;<i> the Record Industry were back in the zero'es, the pricing on most content
</I>&gt;<i> is so low that it really isn't worth while to pirate it for the ordinary
</I>&gt;<i> user. But ease of access is very much an issue in opensim grids.
</I>
In fact, ease of access is mostly given in &quot;open&quot; grids like OSGrid.
The only thing really missing is a tool that allows upload of .iar
and possible .oar through a client connection. This is useful for
people on grids that don't support user connected simulators or
where the user doesn't have the time/expertise/resources to operate
a simulator.

&gt;<i> This very much depends on the country you live in, in my country I am
</I>&gt;<i> entitled to use any digital asset I have licensed in any way I see fit - 
</I>&gt;<i> as
</I>&gt;<i> long as this is done for personal use and I have not made a prior 
</I>&gt;<i> agreement
</I>&gt;<i> with the distributor to not use the asset in said manner.
</I>
As above, that agreement is called the Terms Of Service. Since the
grid is the distributor, this is a valid and legally binding
agreement in any country.

&gt;<i> I do not agree with you about damaging the opensim community, quite the
</I>&gt;<i> opposite. I see two major obstacles preventing widespread use, one is easy
</I>&gt;<i> access to content, and the second is a usable search tool.
</I>
The damaging part is the public's impression that OpenSim equals
content theft.

&gt;<i> There is a lot of free content available, either CC licensed or public
</I>&gt;<i> domain, but until now only grid operators have had access to it.
</I>&gt;<i> MyInventory is intended to give the user access to this content without
</I>&gt;<i> having to be technical savy enough to install and run a simulator.
</I>
See above, such a tool would be a great thing to have.

That is a great idea, too, and will ease access to free and open
licensed content. However, such a service would be responsible for
not distributing content that has no valid license for.

&gt;<i> I am definitely willing to listen to ideas on how to make this tool safer

</I>&gt;<i> policies should be enough for most instances. I don't think anyone can say

</I>
DMCA applies in the US only. Other countries depend on existing
copyright law. This differs from country to country. Some place all
responsibility with the distributor or service provider, others with
users. Almost all require formal suit to be brought, which is not
feasible for a $0.10 item. However, nor suing can lead to a virtual
business being destroyed by 10s of thousands of such thefts because
the proliferation of the free copies makes the original, licensed
item unsaleable. Therefore, technological protection to prevent
&quot;casual&quot; copying need to be in place and the software needs to guide
the user to not export things that they have no permission to export.
The only way to make this in any way safe is to keep it closed source.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ** **
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In an ideal world - except for special cases, the inventory and the
