Hi,
thank you both of you for your answers.
Well firstly I'm using Imprudence. Secondly, I haven't done what Wade Schuette told me, because I had work. Now I'll see all these and I'll inform you about it.
Thank you once more!!!Best regards,Christina

for the sound



Christina,

You may have several different 
problems.

First, there is no &quot;standard&quot; volume for uploaded files.  
I even have problems with some normal mp3's in iTunes

 You may need 
to increase the volume of your sounds and reload them.    Most 
people I know use a wonderful free product called Audacity to do that sort of 
tweaking.  I've had to increase volume of files many times.
<A HREF="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">http://audacity.sourceforge.net/</A>

(side 
note - If you ever want to use audacity to make mp3 files, you also need a 
separate download it tells you about.)
If you get to that point, it's easy to 
use audacity to really boost the volume of your clips and see if that helps. 


So, one question I'd ask is whether you can hear OTHER sounds, and 
whether other people can hear the sounds YOU uploaded.   Both of those 
tests can help pin down whether the problems are at the server end or the client 
end, or both.

First test any YouTube video with soft music to be sure 
your local machine volume is working properly on both clients.
The Moonlight 
Sonata is a good test. I like this version: <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6txOvK-mAk">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6txOvK-mAk</A>

It's 
remarkably easy to inadvertently alter or even mute the local machine's volume 
control.   Even when you have it set correctly,  ill-behaved 
products such as Skype can change your volume and leave it changed when you exit 
them.
Microsoft operating systems have a number of hidden ways they try to be 
&quot;helpful&quot; that interfere with sound in non-obvious ways, both output and 
mike-input. 

Make sure you shove EVERY slider on your audio preferences 
panel to the far right for testing this sort of thing, to eliminate that as a 
confounding problem.

The script commands PLAY and LOOP, or whatever they 
are,  both have their own volume option -- make sure it's set to the 
maximum. (1.0 ?? I forget right 
now.)

Summary:
      (1)  test to see if 
you can hear the Moonlight Sonata equally loud on each computer.   If 
not, investigate and 
fix
            the 
issues that have nothing to do with your clip or OpenSim.  Don't forget to 
look for muted output 
and
            
unplugged cables.

      (2)  See if other 
people can hear your clips in OpenSim.  If they can, and you can't, the 
problem is not with the 

            clips but 
with some other settings on your own 
preferences.

      (3)  Confirm you can 
hear sounds in general and other clips that other people can hear in 
OpenSim.  If 
not,
            you 
still have preferences set wrong, probably, on both 
computers.

      (4)  If you and everyone 
still think your clips are too soft,   try boosting their volume in 
Audacity and 

             
re-uploading them.   

       
(5)  If none of that works,  post again here.  I'll be curious to 
know where the problems were.

  Hi,
  

  I would like to inform you that I have a problem with the 
  sound. We have updated the server to the 
  latest version and I'm running the OpenSim to 2 laptops (one is XP 32-bit and 
  the other Windows 7 64-bit).  In the XP I can only play sounds locally or 
  in world and not at all in a scipt. From the other laptop I cannot hear at all 
  the sounds that I have uploaded. I have exactly the same preferences in Audio 
  and Video. I'm new in OpenSim, so I 
  would like to ask you what I have to 
  do in order to fix it and hear properly every sound.
  

  Thank you in advance.
  

  With regards,
  Christina
