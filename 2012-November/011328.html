</I>&gt;<i> No, I wasn't implying that. I was, perhaps, trying to impress on you that
</I>&gt;<i> there are other ways in which to display a disregard for other people's
</I>&gt;<i> rights and obligations, however. If you truly can't see outside of the &quot;My
</I>&gt;<i> Rights!&quot; box, then, I find myself feeling deeply discouraged.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I hope that I am still capable of seeing both sides of the coin, however, I
am of the impression that in the desire to attract content creators to &quot;the
metaverse&quot;, there has been so much focus on their rights and needs that the
rights and needs of the user base has been neglected. If there are no users
it doesn't matter if there are content creators. The quality of search is
such that the users are better served with out it. The security of the
users is inventory, both due to security vulnerabilities and grids popping
up and disappearing, is so poor that I would think twice before spending
significant amount on acquiring content.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let me try one last tack. It's not as though people here haven't known a
</I>&gt;<i> tool like this is possible, or that there haven't been people capable of
</I>&gt;<i> creating one. But there has been a largely unspoken agreement in the
</I>&gt;<i> community that since OpenSim and the viewers it depends upon do not yet
</I>&gt;<i> have the proper permissions or other facilities necessary to make such a
</I>&gt;<i> tool safe for the majority of use cases, that it's best to shelve such
</I>&gt;<i> projects until there are. This tacit agreement is a good faith effort that
</I>&gt;<i> a member of the community in good standing acknowledges.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>This attitude is exactly the reason why I have deliberately kept my
distance from the community, open source development is very much about
code first talk later.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As it stands, you've so far presented a fait accompli, conceived and
</I>&gt;<i> developed to this point without community input, with no real indication
</I>&gt;<i> that you have any interest in solving the real issues that prevent at least
</I>&gt;<i> some of the controversy associated
</I>
I've agreed to letting the community have a preview of the functionality
prior to going open source and have not - as of yet - completely rejected
an &quot;opt-in&quot; scheme, I have expressed doubts about an &quot;opt-in&quot; scheme, and
the responses I get seem to vindicate my doubts.


&gt;<i> with this sort of tool. An unbending insistence on making grid operators
</I>&gt;<i> opt-in to content protection is not a good faith gesture. Not first taking
</I>&gt;<i> steps to work with OpenSim core developers or TPVs to have at least some
</I>&gt;<i> safeguards in place wasn't either. You seem to be treating such safeguards
</I>&gt;<i> as trivialities or irrelevancies. I promise you that to many of us, they're
</I>&gt;<i> neither.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I must have overlooked something, I don't really see where TPV's come to
bear. No, I do not consider those safeguards as irrelevancies. E.g. the
vulnerabilities discussed with Diva. They are a clear example of coders
knowingly implementing security safeguards &quot;client side (well simulator
side, but in a hypergrid that is pretty much the same)&quot;. Fortunately - and
to me hard to understand why they haven't - hardening the interfaces
somewhat isn't that hard.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do I want a tool that lets me reliably backup my inventory without having
</I>&gt;<i> console access? Yes. Oh, god yes! But I also want one that protects *my*
</I>&gt;<i> reputation as a user, that I can use without fear of being labeled as an
</I>&gt;<i> infringer. I say this as someone who does not own or operate a grid. As a
</I>&gt;<i> user, I need to know I'm using a reputable tool that the community accepts.
</I>&gt;<i> Would such a tool probably take more effort than the one you have now?
</I>&gt;<i> Certainly. But with rights come responsibilities, one of which is the
</I>&gt;<i> recognition of and support of other people's rights, even ones you may not
</I>&gt;<i> be legally required to support. &quot;I can,&quot; doesn't always mean you should.
</I>&gt;<i> And &quot;not illegal&quot; doesn't always mean right. Other people matter. That's
</I>&gt;<i> how I look at it, anyway.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I and others keep telling you, right now your tool isn't sounding like
</I>&gt;<i> one I could use. That's unfortunate, because it could be, with more work,
</I>&gt;<i> effort, and a willingness to accept the realities others besides yourself
</I>&gt;<i> must live with. You can still do that.
