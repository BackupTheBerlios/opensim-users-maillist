<PRE>Diva ....

In so many ways I believe we have the same vision of what the metaverse
should be. But we disagree on a few details on implementation.

In my vision the user does not need to run a simulator, all he or she needs
is a storage location for inventory content and assets, and contact
information (friends). Whether the user decides to house that storage in
&quot;the cloud&quot; or on a local computer is - even today - completely irrelevant
to my implementation.

Using Robust as a basis for storing a users personal inventory and assets
(legally licensed naturally) is asking too much of the average user in my
personal opinion, it needs to be simpler.

I am not against Robust, it was a big step forward compared to UGAIM, but
not for users.

As for bots, there is no doubt that it is easy to detect bots, the real
question is whether blocking for MyInventory - as long as it isn't used for
copyright infringement - is doing the user base a dis-service or not? I am
definitely not trying to belittle content creators, they do a very
important job, but with out a solid and strong user base, what purpose -
beyond the pleasure of creation - serves the process of content creation?

MyInventory is foremost designed to be a tool for end users, and the
roadmap I envision is based on user needs. I won't delve to much on the
plans since they are worthless unless they are backed by code. Users need
content creators and Content creators needs users and easy - controllable
and manageable  - distribution channels, users need content, easy
distribution channels and regions.

I hope that clarifies why I have opted to stay away from writing code for
Robust.

Best regards
Snowcrash

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After I wrote this, I realized that maybe the reason why you did your tool
</I>&gt;<i> the way you did it is because you don't know how to do it in any other way.
</I>&gt;<i> So let me explain what's the &quot;right&quot; way of doing it. (&quot;right&quot; meaning that
</I>&gt;<i> you won't upset anyone; on the contrary, you'll be thanked)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You should develop a robust-bound service that packs and unpacks
</I>&gt;<i> inventory, and that can accomodate a variety of export policies. The tool
</I>&gt;<i> that runs in people's computers would then interact with that piece of
</I>&gt;<i> server-side code directly. It's not hard to do.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Doing it this way, the people who run these services have choices. For
</I>&gt;<i> example, Fleep would likely run that service in FleepGrid using its most
</I>&gt;<i> permissive policy (all items). Melanie would run that service in Avination,
</I>&gt;<i> maybe, using its most strict policy (only items created by the user). Some
</I>&gt;<i> other commercial grids might not run the service at all. When we finally
</I>&gt;<i> have the export flag, that can also be taken into consideration. Etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The way you are doing it, you give grid operators no choice, because
</I>&gt;<i> you're exploiting the viewer channel using libomv hacks. The lack of choice
</I>&gt;<i> upsets people. You're right that you didn't create libomv, and that what
</I>&gt;<i> you did can, indeed, be done by others. I am on the camp of those who think
</I>&gt;<i> that using the viewer channel for accessing grid resources should be done
</I>&gt;<i> only and exactly by person-driven viewers, and that therefore grids should
</I>&gt;<i> refuse service to ALL client bots, even those that are embedded in the
</I>&gt;<i> viewers -- bots are not hard to detect, especially if they want to do
</I>&gt;<i> things as fast as they must. Don't be surprised if you see bot-kicking
</I>&gt;<i> opensim extensions coming soon, rendering your tool (and others') useless.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim is open source and has a great plugin architecture; practically
</I>&gt;<i> everything you can envisioning doing can be done by extending the
</I>&gt;<i> server-side with useful features, which can then be used or not by whoever
</I>&gt;<i> runs these worlds.
