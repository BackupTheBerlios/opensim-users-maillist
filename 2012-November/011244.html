<PRE>I just wanted to add my two cents to yours to say I agree. It is why 
once I get enough built onto my grid that I accept others as users and 
want to know those I add. I will not allow strangers to add themselves. 
I may add a guest account for those to try with limited power. I am not 
connecting to Hypergrid, Only a few will be allowed build privileges.

My grid is for role players, and students of Asian Ryukyu History. Can 
be considered educational, and I hope to hold Events of the time period 
and more. I have bought a few skin creator kits PSDs on Market place in 
SL, but I asked permission of the creators, telling them exactly what I 
am doing. They gave me expressed permission to use the skins I create 
with their kit as long as I never give the kit. There are some very 
friendly people who create in Secondlife as long as you show some 
respect for their talent.

I don't want anything to ruin the trust they gave me to use some objects 
they made on my grid by having software like this it will be harder to 
convice the use of many other objects and items they would otherwise 
trust me to use.

InuYasha.

</I>&gt;<i> a number of closed grids trying to actually correct that assumption by 
</I>&gt;<i> providing a more secure environment for content creators to operate in.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Just my 2 cents. Do what you will with it

</I>&gt;<i> Hi
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Before this gets out of hand, let me clarify, this is not a backup 
</I>&gt;<i> tool, at least no per se, one of the features is the ability to backup 
</I>&gt;<i> content from an existing account (a backup which is governed by a policy).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The primary goal of the project is to move the inventory and the 
</I>&gt;<i> assets to their rightful users and to empower the users to use the 
</I>&gt;<i> assets as they want - within legal limits.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In an ideal world - except for special cases, the inventory and the 
</I>&gt;<i> assets backing the inventory is controlled by the user, and that is 
</I>&gt;<i> the goal of the project, to bring the inventory under the control of 
</I>&gt;<i> the user.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To this purpose it currently has two input streams supporting it (one 
</I>&gt;<i> more is planned), the first is client side access to .iar files, the 
</I>&gt;<i> second is download from the users existing inventory, to the extent 
</I>&gt;<i> allowed by law and agreements made between the user and grid operators.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Knowing that only a few of the grid operators using Open Sim has 
</I>&gt;<i> policies in place, this email serves as an invitation to make these 
</I>&gt;<i> policies public, and to implement - to the extent possible - these 
</I>&gt;<i> policies in MyInventory.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The question of attribution is only relevant when the assets are being 
</I>&gt;<i> distributed, MyInventory has currently no functionality for 
</I>&gt;<i> distribution. The as yet unfinished and only hinted at third input 
</I>&gt;<i> stream deals with distribution. The current implementation does not 
</I>&gt;<i> distribute any data, it only grants a user simpler way access to the 
</I>&gt;<i> assets the user has rightfully access to.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best regards
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Snowcrash
