<PRE>i had that issue in several viewers. Please make sure you try to set the
following in the viewer preferences:
PREFRENCES / GENERAL / RATING setting is set to :

I want to access content rated PG &amp; MATURE and PG &amp; MATURE &amp; ADULT
After that in Singularity, Imprudence and Phoenix* sound started playing
(after the sound assets where downloaded - took some times) ..
if not try downloading the Singularity and see if it is a real Imprudence
problem
 
hope this helps and best regards

here are some error reports for singularity i created

Hi, 

thank you both of you for your answers.
Well firstly I'm using Imprudence.  
Secondly, I haven't done what Wade Schuette told me, because I had work. Now
I'll see all these and I'll inform you about it.

Thank you once more!!!
Best regards,
Christina

Christina,

You may have several different problems.

First, there is no &quot;standard&quot; volume for uploaded files.  I even have
problems with some normal mp3's in iTunes

 You may need to increase the volume of your sounds and reload them.    Most
people I know use a wonderful free product called Audacity to do that sort
of tweaking.  I've had to increase volume of files many times.
<A HREF="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">http://audacity.sourceforge.net/</A>

(side note - If you ever want to use audacity to make mp3 files, you also
need a separate download it tells you about.)
If you get to that point, it's easy to use audacity to really boost the
volume of your clips and see if that helps. 

So, one question I'd ask is whether you can hear OTHER sounds, and whether
other people can hear the sounds YOU uploaded.   Both of those tests can
help pin down whether the problems are at the server end or the client end,
or both.

First test any YouTube video with soft music to be sure your local machine
volume is working properly on both clients.
The Moonlight Sonata is a good test. I like this version:
<A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6txOvK-mAk">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6txOvK-mAk</A>

It's remarkably easy to inadvertently alter or even mute the local machine's
volume control.   Even when you have it set correctly,  ill-behaved products
such as Skype can change your volume and leave it changed when you exit
them.
Microsoft operating systems have a number of hidden ways they try to be
&quot;helpful&quot; that interfere with sound in non-obvious ways, both output and
mike-input. 

Make sure you shove EVERY slider on your audio preferences panel to the far
right for testing this sort of thing, to eliminate that as a confounding
problem.

The script commands PLAY and LOOP, or whatever they are,  both have their
own volume option -- make sure it's set to the maximum. (1.0 ?? I forget
right now.)

Summary:
      (1)  test to see if you can hear the Moonlight Sonata equally loud on
each computer.   If not, investigate and fix
            the issues that have nothing to do with your clip or OpenSim.
Don't forget to look for muted output and
            unplugged cables.

      (2)  See if other people can hear your clips in OpenSim.  If they can,
and you can't, the problem is not with the 
            clips but with some other settings on your own preferences.

      (3)  Confirm you can hear sounds in general and other clips that other
people can hear in OpenSim.  If not,
            you still have preferences set wrong, probably, on both
computers.

      (4)  If you and everyone still think your clips are too soft,   try
boosting their volume in Audacity and 
             re-uploading them.   

       (5)  If none of that works,  post again here.  I'll be curious to
know where the problems were.

Hi,

I would like to inform you that I have a problem with the sound. We have
updated the server to the latest version and I'm running the OpenSim to 2
laptops (one is XP 32-bit and the other Windows 7 64-bit).  In the XP I can
only play sounds locally or in world and not at all in a scipt. From the
other laptop I cannot hear at all the sounds that I have uploaded. I have
exactly the same preferences in Audio and Video. I'm new in OpenSim, so I
would like to ask you what I have to do in order to fix it and hear properly
every sound.


Thank you in advance.


With regards,
Christina
