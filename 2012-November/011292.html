<PRE>No problem InuYasha.  As you say, if the sound is being triggered by the event then that suggests it's something to do 
with object movement rather than a slow event fire.

If you want, please open a Mantis and attach the script so I (and others can try it).  Or you may want to try the osgrid 
forums since if anything they have much more experience with scripting (I have surprisingly little).

</I>&gt;<i> Even on this old computer no change since 7.3.1 it wasn't horrible.  I am set up using Robust in grid mode now.  Not
</I>&gt;<i> connected to other grid, this is the grid.  My regions are split into 8 other directories running about 8 or less
</I>&gt;<i> regions of opensim each.  I say 8 or less because most run 8, but in the middle I have one two region mega region in the
</I>&gt;<i> center.  I plan to build Okinawa's Shuri Castle and didn't want people falling into a region border while crossing the
</I>&gt;<i> courtyard.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I may have to take that out, because it seems I do have issues walking from a normal sim to the megaregion at times.
</I>&gt;<i> But the rest of my 56 regions seems to do fine for now. I can build very well and get the objects done, and take them
</I>&gt;<i> into inventory now and again until I get my monster system and can put it all out at once and more permanently placed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At the moment I have landscaping, and a small growing Ryukyu Kingdom late 17th century village.  This was all working in
</I>&gt;<i> 7.3.1, I upgraded and suddenly,  my doors went wonky.  In SL and 7.3.1 the same script would move the doors, while the
</I>&gt;<i> sound set off at the same moment.  The sound file is short and sounds like a sort of large wooden sliding barn door.
</I>&gt;<i> The inside has thin washi paper doors, and a sound from a sliding paper door I had.  Those doors also timed correctly in
</I>&gt;<i> SL and 7.3.1 of Opensim.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After the upgrade, and copying the info from the 7.3.1 and typing it in by hand, clicking the door, results in, the
</I>&gt;<i> sound starting imidiately, then my AV has time to stop showing a beam from the hand, and puts his arm at his side, wait
</I>&gt;<i> a bit more then the door using the lsl while to slide the door starts and slides to where it should go.  It seems the
</I>&gt;<i> reaction time varies.  And the door don't slide smooth like it used to. It was and is, supposed to use the WHILE to use
</I>&gt;<i> a counter to slide the door, nice and smooth, but it seems to move a bit, pause a couple of random times and spaces
</I>&gt;<i> while sliding, and eventually move into place.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is the entire problem.  I dicovered that since the sound starts nearly at clicking that is must not be the click
</I>&gt;<i> event that is slow. Because the sound does start on clicking.  Only the door no longer starts slidinging for what is
</I>&gt;<i> nearly 2 seconds after hearing the sound. At least it seems that long.  Like I said, I might have missed something
</I>&gt;<i> someplace.  I am legally blind with only one eye with a retina detachment in the one good eye.  I definatly could have.
</I>&gt;<i> But where to look for something like that? All my other scripts seem to be ok. Korean black conon fires, paper lantern
</I>&gt;<i> with menu lights and extinguish, and ower user controls, are all working.  But the lights don't have a sound associated
</I>&gt;<i> with them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry this mesage was so long, but I guess I wanted to clean up any confusion.
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks so much for your time and interest.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I suspect this is probably unrelated.  InuYusha, you may want to check your ScriptDelayFactor in the [XEngine] config
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> section and MinThreads, MaxThreads, etc. settings.  There may be a particular problem if you have updated by copying
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> over 0.7.3.1 config files - hence we recommend manually updating from fresh 0.7.4 files even though that can be a pain.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Beyond that, I don't have any immediate idea why event firing would suddenly be delayed if the content of the regions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and the hardware is exactly the same.  I will probably try and add a script event debug switch so we can see when the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> event is actually being fired.  However, that would require updating to bleeding edge to use and would likely only be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the first diagnostic step. You can see some XEngine information per region with the command &quot;xengine status&quot;, though
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm not sure how much that would tell us.  Still, it would be worth seeing.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm also going to make the same point that InuYasha is probably sick of - 56 regions on a standalone (I'm a bit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> confused by &quot;standalone grid&quot;) is a very unusual configuration - most people don't run more than a couple on a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> simulator (and many people run 1, preferring to start separate OpenSim.exe instances instead!. So the basic things
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would be to try is seeing if reducing the number of regions (hence reducing other script load, etc.) makes a difference.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> There was a long thread on the listserv recently about other reports of similar behavior in 0.7.4, which I believe is

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I continue to use 0.7.4 on both grids with no symptoms like this, as far as I can tell.  I even did some fairly extended

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     Making sure it isn't only me, noticing, after upgrading from Opensim 7.3.1 to Opensim 7.4 my touch to run scripts
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     slowing down. Specifically sliding doors that used to react when clicked to start sliding.  Now, my Avatar appears
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     to raise a hand to click the door, the particle beam starts, then stops, and with enough time to move my arm back
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     down, a total of two seconds and then the door finally moves.  It was almost instant in version 7.3.1.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     Could I have made a bad setting to slow it down to start the click event to start sliding so late, or is this
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     something other people see in their touch to start scripts. My sliding door sound used to start and seemed to be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     perfectly timed so the door would slide at the same time as the door would move.  Now I hear the sound many seconds
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     before the door moves and finishes way before the door stops moving because it started so late.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     Anything I can do?  Or should I start a mantis?  I used the same script in SL, and in 7.3.1 that acted the same, but
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     not anymore.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     Thanks for any time on this, you friend and big fan, InuYasha.
