<PRE>I feel compelled to clarify that while some grids have a Terms of Service
that forbids transfer of content off grid by anyone but the creator, that
is certainly not the case for all grids.  I do not think I am the only one,
in fact, I'd guess most small, personal use grids do not have a TOS, or,
even if they do, most HG connected grids I have visited have a freebie area
where they explicitly have items for visitors that are clearly intended to
be taken off grid.

So making the statement &quot;Transfer off the grid is not allowed&quot; is simply
not true.  Transfer off of SOME grids is not allowed.  Some (my guess is
many) grids DO allow it.  I think what is unusual about FleepGrid as a use
case is not that I allow transfer off grid, but that everything on my grid
is CC licensed.  My guess is most typical small grids allow some but not
all items to be transfered off grid.  But either way, it cannot be said
that transfering items off of grids is universally forbidden.  Commercial
and closed grids forbid it.  Many personal, open, or HG connected grids do
not.

I think it's important to keep mentioning the different use cases of small,
personal, independent grids and not just have everyone keep assuming and
defaulting to the use cases of the large, commercial, or closed grids.

Sincerely,

- Chris/Fleep

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Whether copying an item I have licensed but not created from the personal

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; moving from one personal storage location to another is very much at an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; open question which I doubt has no clear answer in any country.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Transfer from one account to another on the same grid is governed by
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;no copy&quot; permission. Transfer off the grid is not allowed. It
</I>&gt;<i> really is that simple but I'm really getting the impression that you
</I>&gt;<i> don't want to accept that. I understand you'd like reality to be
</I>&gt;<i> different and you'd like users to actually own their inventory
</I>&gt;<i> outright but that s simply not the case. Some TOS restrict items to
</I>&gt;<i> one grid only and don't allow download of items you have not
</I>&gt;<i> yourself created. If you download something you acquired from
</I>&gt;<i> someone else in one of those grids, it is theft. No matter what the
</I>&gt;<i> purpose of the download is.
