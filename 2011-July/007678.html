<PRE>Hi Garrett,

Firstly, Welcome to the wild and wacky world of OpenSims!

I'm also an artist, a half-assed academic (sorry!) and have a LOT of
experience with OpenSims, SecondLife, &amp;etc.

My SL rezday is back in Dec of 2004, and I confess I havent logged in to SL
in some years, due to my extensive involvement with OpenSims.

First thing to know, is that the topologicla space is a bit different here.
With SL, you have a company producing a product, and they more or less try
to 'contain and control' (with more or less succes), all of the technical,
economic, and social aspects of their virtual world. With OpenSims, there
are three primary communities; Developers, Testers, and Early Adopters. Each
of these has one or more distinct communities surrounding it, and there is
both considerable overlap between them and some odd instances of isolation.

Perhaps the most high profile community (and it is made up of a good many
subcommunities) is on OSgrid (see <A HREF="http://osgrid.org">http://osgrid.org</A>). It is fast, fun,
furious, unstable, high risk, almost completely anonymous; verily, a
conundrum made up of upturned wormcans. It's a fascinating place, and much
like SL, it can steal your brain.

In the interest of full disclosure, I was a volunteer admin there for around
four years, and it finally got to be too much for me and I left (though I do
still maintain a simple user's presence there). It continues to be vigorous
in my absence ;)

I'd say start there; meet people and extend your social reach into the
space. You'll find a fairly vigorous 'Welcome Area' community there, not
unlike SL's. They will be able to provide you with some good jumping-off
points.

Good luck, and feel free to give a shout out to me if you have additional
questions.

Cheers!
James
aka Hiro Protagonist

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Interested in extending my practice into OpenSim - the whole Linden thing
</I>&gt;<i> just annoys me, too costly and am a big supporter of anything opensource as
</I>&gt;<i> I can get my hands dirty so to speak.  Very hopeful about the future of
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim, and the approach of a post alpha version.  But I'm also keen to
</I>&gt;<i> bring my students into OpenSim.  I've set up a four region space, search
</I>&gt;<i> for:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> CCI Sandbox Sim
</I>&gt;<i> CCI Gallery Sim
</I>&gt;<i> CCI New Media Sim
</I>&gt;<i> CCI Moving Image Sim
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The regions are ready but we are still working on getting the server to
</I>&gt;<i> auto restart when it crashes so bear with us.  They already have open access
</I>&gt;<i> sandboxs and a gallery (similar to spaces in Second Life like Art Nation).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is an ulterior motive for all of this...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What I am a little disappointed about is the lack of overall culture in
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim which is present in Second Life, from my point of view an arts
</I>&gt;<i> community, running exhibitions, performances, symposium, workshops etc.
</I>&gt;<i>  Groups don't seem to be as successful as they are in Second Life and I've
</I>&gt;<i> not come across any mailing lists for this - perhaps I'm totally wrong and
</I>&gt;<i> somebody can point some out to me?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any artists on this list who are looking for a culture on OpenSim?  Anyone
</I>&gt;<i> who wants to start getting initiates together?
