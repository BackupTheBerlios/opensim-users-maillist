<PRE>I have been doing some more testing of meshes into OpenSim (r/16234 
from a day or two ago, so quite recent on the server side).

I have been using various viewers for upload, and for viewing the 
meshes in my tests.

With some large Collada meshes, I noticed some errors saying that the 
asset was not benign stored due to the limit on max_allowed_packet.. 
which it seems by default for the server side is 1MB in MySQL. 
Funnily though the meshes that said they failed to store did seem to 
persist in world and in inventory, and could be rezzed out of 
inventory even afyer the OpenSim.exe error was indicated.  A bit odd 
I thought.  I upped the max_allowed_packet to 16MB and the meshes 
were stored fine.  The answer is to add max_allowed_packet=16M into 
the [mysqld] section of your MySQL config .ini file.

[mysqld]
max_allowed_packet

See this for information, where it explicitly indicates that the 
server size is set low at 1MB and you may need to increase it if you 
work with large BLOBS, which I assume Collada content is stored in...

The other thing I have noticed is that there is a change in the 
rendering in world of my complex meshes between LL 2.7.2 and 2.7.4 
viewers.  For ones UPLOADED in 2.7.2 (or Kirstens S21 RC1) on OpenSim 
r/16234 they render fine in both 2.7.2 and 2.7.4 viewers with LOD 
handled well as you zoom out.  BUT, for ones uploaded in LL 2.7.4 
(exactly the same model, and exactly the same OpenASim.exe server), 
the LOD is handled poorly, and soe quite large parts of the meshes 
disappear even when only zooming out 30-60 metres.  It looks 
bad.  See the three progressively more zoomed out examples here for 
the LL 2.7.4 uploaded mesh, whereeas the vehicle looks the same with 
all parts intact at all three zoom distances with a LL 2.7.2 viewer 
uploaded mesh

Anyone else have any experience to report on mesh testing on OpenSim 0.7.2 dev?
