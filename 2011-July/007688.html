Hi Garret,

A friend of mine ( Galen TechnoShaman ) is doing a lot of ART related
installations on his 
OSGRID Region called Cyberbohemia.
<A HREF="http://www.cyberbohemia.net/index.php?/pages/indexgallery.html">http://www.cyberbohemia.net/index.php?/pages/indexgallery.html</A>
For the OSG4B he is holding a special Birthday installation beween the 22.07
- 24.07 - called 
&quot;Living picture&quot;
<A HREF="http://www.cyberbohemia.net/index.php?/archives/94-The-living-picture.html">http://www.cyberbohemia.net/index.php?/archives/94-The-living-picture.html</A>

He will be happy if you drop by anytime. We were also talking to Artists in
SL and also to the
person that was running the NPIRL (not possible in Real Life) Blog but those
Avatars told us 
that ART is more common in e.g. SL because of the &quot;attention the artist
gets&quot; .. Or on
those &quot;commercial&quot; opensimgrids where/whatever those are .. 

We than anyhow loosely formed the ANPOOG Group (Also Not Possible on Opensim
Grids) but as we are 
both working on our regions and with lack of interested Avatars, this
project is in 'snooze' state ..

I also know of 2 other interesting avatars on OSGRID. In no specific order i
would name
Ruben Haan with his 'Kliederaar' region and that Cornflakes Woodcock Avatar
with his 
brilliant, clownish-crazy 'Cornflakes' - Mad World Region and Sandbox.
Memyself and I,
do some kind of more visual things with textures and particles. So, If you
ever are 
on the OSGRID, drop me or Galen a IM to get in touch with us .. As there is
lot of 
space on the osgrid why not form a Continent of Art or a Art Cluster ?

We would for sure spend some land or a helping hand for &quot;poor&quot;
migration-willingly (SL) artists&quot; ... 

best regards
Wordfromthe Wise

Betreff: [Opensim-users] Introduction

Hi All

Never really took the time to introduce myself and this list has been very
helpful in setting up our OpenSim regions, I know the educators list
(<A HREF="https://lists.secondlife.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/educators">https://lists.secondlife.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/educators</A>)
are keen on introductions - it's a good idea to see what people are doing.

So for my part overdue, here goes...

I'm an artist and an academic (in that order) and have migrated over  
from Second Life where I've been very active in the arts community.   
Most recently doing a residency&quot;
<A HREF="http://www.asquare.org/works/yoshikaze-up-in-the-air-second-life-residency">http://www.asquare.org/works/yoshikaze-up-in-the-air-second-life-residency</A>
  (see links below for more on what I do).

Interested in extending my practice into OpenSim - the whole Linden thing
just annoys me, too costly and am a big supporter of anything opensource as
I can get my hands dirty so to speak.  Very hopeful about the future of
OpenSim, and the approach of a post alpha version.  But I'm also keen to
bring my students into OpenSim.  I've set up a four region space, search
for:

CCI Sandbox Sim
CCI Gallery Sim
CCI New Media Sim
CCI Moving Image Sim

The regions are ready but we are still working on getting the server to auto
restart when it crashes so bear with us.  They already have open access
sandboxs and a gallery (similar to spaces in Second Life like Art Nation).

There is an ulterior motive for all of this...

What I am a little disappointed about is the lack of overall culture in
OpenSim which is present in Second Life, from my point of view an arts
community, running exhibitions, performances, symposium, workshops etc.
Groups don't seem to be as successful as they are in Second Life and I've
not come across any mailing lists for this - perhaps I'm totally wrong and
somebody can point some out to me?

Any artists on this list who are looking for a culture on OpenSim?   
Anyone who wants to start getting initiates together?

Garrett
