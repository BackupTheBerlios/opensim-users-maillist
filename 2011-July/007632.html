<PRE>Hi,

Well this has been difficult to get going for me as well so don't feel too
bad.

I do have it working for imprudence 1.3.0 RC. (I didn't get  it to work for
a later version) and diva build opensim 0.1.1.1 Post_fixes  

1.      On each user's machine running imprudence the only thing I did is
install whisper 0 .2.7 version found here
<A HREF="http://whisper.vcomm.ch/download/0.2.7/whisper_setup_0.2.7.exe">http://whisper.vcomm.ch/download/0.2.7/whisper_setup_0.2.7.exe</A> I did not
modify any files, just installed this package in the imprudence folder.

2.      On the machine running opensim I put the 3 binnaries we both got
from the other fellow into the opensim/bin folder and then added the new
section to my opensim.ini file. I did not make any changes to any other
files. Here is a copy of what I added to the opensim.ini (remember that the
name of the region is case sensitive and no special characters.) If you
visit <A HREF="http://3dcolab.com:9015/wifi/">http://3dcolab.com:9015/wifi/</A> you could get an account and see if your
imprudence set up is working on a our world which I have it working on.

3.      I am not sure it is working quite correctly and I also point out
that you need to pay close attention to how your pc input and output is
configured. Also it does not work well for me with out a head set. Let me
know how it is going.

SOrry, I forgot to properly thank you for that.

But now it seems I did something wrong in my murmur.ini and maybe even my
section that goes into the opensim.ini.   I am a little conflicted.  The
very first web site I wqas pointed to said they didn't have to change the
defult murmur.ini file and it ran.  But really is there something to change
here?

And I am not even sure about the[murmur] section.  Maybe a better
explaination might help.

Adam,
It appears you are responding about the Murmur voice topic but your subject 
hides that information
 
Gary Beck

 
 
My apologies, Gary-I did realise pretty much immediately after I posted that
response and re-posted immediately with a corrected subject line and an
apology but the second one didn't seem  to make it through. For the record,
for a second time, my apologies.

WEll I looked after having trouble and finding I was using the wrong 
version, I can't find the 1.2.1 version and might also ned those correct 
DLLs. So I guess until we find a way to get them we are all a bit stuck. 
We need the right installs for the murmur sever as well as the dlls to 
be inthe correct bin folder for version 7.1.1. of opensim.  Anyone got help?

I've added the Mumble-1.2.1.exe to the following location:
 
<A HREF="http://www.fdn.uq.edu.au/opensim/Mumble/">http://www.fdn.uq.edu.au/opensim/Mumble/</A>
 
All you need to install is the Murmur server- don't worry about the mumble
client as you'll be using the whisper client (which is a modified
SLVoice.exe)
For good measure, I've put the appropriate whisper client installer there as
well, so everything you need to get Mumble going on 0.7.1.1 for Windows is
now there.
