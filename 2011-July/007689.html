<PRE>Hi Garrett,

I think I recognize your name from SL.  Did you have an installation on 
the Columbia College sim at some point?  I am an ex-faculty/staffer from 
there (both SL and RL).  If I'm mistaken, my apologies.  Either way, 
welcome to OpenSim :)

As for the culture/community, it's definitely not as 'in your face' as 
SL.  However, it's (a) still quite young and (b) a mixed bag of 
participants with a far greater range of technical proficiency, creative 
potential and sense of individuality than SL ever had.  It's also more 
spread out due to it's decentralized nature which generally leads to 
people getting (happily) lost in their own little worlds, or at the very 
least focusing their time and energy on projects they were never able to 
complete before rather than community building.  I have to admit, I fall 
into the latter category.  I'm currently working on a long-term (years?) 
transmedia project that is consuming virtually all of my time and energy 
allotted for OpenSim activities.  As a result,  'I don't get out much'...

I think in time the community will come together in the larger sense - 
when it's ready.  I'm actually happy to see that it's growing at it's 
own pace rather than being hastily jammed into the 'SL Clone' pigeon 
hole.  It may aggravate the impatient, but in the long run I think it 
will be a far more thoughtful and emotionally mature community than many 
of us are used to elsewhere.  However, continuing to foster the 
formation of groups and communities, especially for specific agendas 
like education and the arts, is beneficial to the overall future of OpenSim.

I'm interested in seeing what you've set up for both your students and 
your personal work and again, welcome to the frontier.

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> CCI Gallery Sim
</I>&gt;<i> CCI New Media Sim
</I>&gt;<i> CCI Moving Image Sim
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The regions are ready but we are still working on getting the server

</I>&gt;<i> open access sandboxs and a gallery (similar to spaces in Second Life 
</I>&gt;<i> like Art Nation).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is an ulterior motive for all of this...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What I am a little disappointed about is the lack of overall culture 
</I>&gt;<i> in OpenSim which is present in Second Life, from my point of view an 
</I>&gt;<i> arts community, running exhibitions, performances, symposium, 
</I>&gt;<i> workshops etc.  Groups don't seem to be as successful as they are in 
</I>&gt;<i> Second Life and I've not come across any mailing lists for this - 
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps I'm totally wrong and somebody can point some out to me?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any artists on this list who are looking for a culture on OpenSim?  
</I>&gt;<i> Anyone who wants to start getting initiates together?
