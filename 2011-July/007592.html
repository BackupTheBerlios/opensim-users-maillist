</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As I'm sure everybody on these lists is aware, OpenSimulator currently has some restrictions on who can contribute
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> code to the project (<A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Contributions_Policy">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Contributions_Policy</A>).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In order to grant a copyright license there needs to be a receiving entity. To this end, we are in the process of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> setting up an organisation known as the Overte Foundation. The Overte Foundation will receive the copyright licenses
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and become the official distributor of OpenSimulator rather than individual core developers. This will put it in a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> good position to deal with code origin or other issues, if any should ever arise.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Once the CLA is complete, the current contribution restrictions to OpenSimulator will be removed. It will be down to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> each developer (including core developers) to affirm via the CLA that they have the necessary rights over the code
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that they are contributing.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> One advantage of going down the foundation route is that it will also be able to promote and support OpenSimulator in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> other ways, quite possibly incorporating members of the community other than just developers. The foundation could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> also extend to cover other open-source virtual-environment/virtual-world projects and components. In the short term,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> though, we will be concentrating on establishing the CLA.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I will be acting as the first Overte Foundation president, with Diva as treasurer, Melanie as secretary and Nebadon
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and Ben as initial board members. The foundation itself will not directly control OpenSimulator development - this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will remain with the OpenSimulator team and community as it does now.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Discussion about this is very welcome, whether supporting or critical. I'm logging off now so will likely answer any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> points tomorrow. Of course, other core developers are very welcome to chip in.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Best,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Justin and team, I think this is a great move and a good start. There are a number of people who have been unable to
</I>&gt;<i> contribute to the project and hopefully this will address this abiliity.
</I>
Thanks for the encouragement from you and other folks.  Organizing this kind of thing isn't easy but hopefully it will 
pay off.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would like to add that an excellent additional goal for the foundation would be to produce and maintain a roadmap for
</I>&gt;<i> the elements under its care. Perhaps even a process for how a project is included, how it moves between stages, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For OpenSim itself I think the project has suffered a bit with the &quot;perpetual alpha&quot; status and discussion towards and
</I>&gt;<i> the publishing of a roadmap that moves it out of that state and into some more mature state would be welcome personally
</I>&gt;<i> by me. Of course the work is still done by volunteers but if this move increases contribution level and the foundation
</I>&gt;<i> leadership shares vision in the form of a roadmap you may find these new contributors willing to pitch in to make that
</I>&gt;<i> vision a reality.
</I>
Historically, I haven't been keen on a roadmap because there's nobody who can enforce that its goals will be met. 
Everybody's interests are quite different and there's no single company employing developers.  I think it's tricky to 
set targets in that kind of environment, unless they're completely 'aspirational'.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Those kinds of things of course take time. But I'd hope they could be considered. In the meantime congratulations on
</I>&gt;<i> what I see personally as an excellent first step!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Mike
