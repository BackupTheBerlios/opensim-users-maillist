<PRE>Hi James and Loralai

Thanks for your reply.  I meant to say the regions I mentioned are all  
on OSgrid.  I've been using OpenSim (front and back) for about 5  
months now so tech wise feel pretty comfortable with it.  Any people  
I've stumbled on in world are usually having very techy conversations  
(which is understandable since it's still Apha and we are all setting  
up our servers) but I just worry what happens when it's stable and  
everyone has a space - it will come.  What do we all do then?  If  
there is nothing to do in world then people will drift away, tech  
challenges will only last so long so this is really all about  
sustainability/longevity of the 'place' of OpenSim.  If anything keeps  
Second Life going it's the culture, attending things, meeting people  
whatever your thing is there is a culture for it.

I understand people are investing an enormous amount of time and  
energy into OpenSim to get it working and the work so far is  
phenomenal (genuinely well done) but other things need to get rolling  
to sustain it all.  Loralai, what your company seem to be doing is  
great.  It would be good to see that provision of culture, art,  
community happening across existing grids as well.  Having it on your  
own grid is fine but the whole issue of moving from one grid to  
another is still far from easy so yet another grid at the moment will  
just mean competition and risks seclusion.  When crossing grids works,  
having a set of regions (because hopefully the 'border crossing' will  
be transparent) that specialise in culture, art, community will do  
well but I suspect that at the moment its a case of it needs to be  
taken to where the users are.

James, are you a practicing artist in OpenSim?  Would love to see  
anything you have done.

Garrett

&gt;<i> Hi Garrett,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Firstly, Welcome to the wild and wacky world of OpenSims!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm also an artist, a half-assed academic (sorry!) and have a LOT of
</I>&gt;<i> experience with OpenSims, SecondLife, &amp;etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My SL rezday is back in Dec of 2004, and I confess I havent logged  
</I>&gt;<i> in to SL
</I>&gt;<i> in some years, due to my extensive involvement with OpenSims.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First thing to know, is that the topologicla space is a bit  
</I>&gt;<i> different here.
</I>&gt;<i> With SL, you have a company producing a product, and they more or  
</I>&gt;<i> less try
</I>&gt;<i> to 'contain and control' (with more or less succes), all of the  
</I>&gt;<i> technical,
</I>&gt;<i> economic, and social aspects of their virtual world. With OpenSims,  
</I>&gt;<i> there
</I>&gt;<i> are three primary communities; Developers, Testers, and Early  
</I>&gt;<i> Adopters. Each
</I>&gt;<i> of these has one or more distinct communities surrounding it, and  
</I>&gt;<i> there is
</I>&gt;<i> both considerable overlap between them and some odd instances of  
</I>&gt;<i> isolation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps the most high profile community (and it is made up of a good  
</I>&gt;<i> many
</I>&gt;<i> subcommunities) is on OSgrid (see <A HREF="http://osgrid.org">http://osgrid.org</A>). It is fast, fun,
</I>&gt;<i> furious, unstable, high risk, almost completely anonymous; verily, a
</I>&gt;<i> conundrum made up of upturned wormcans. It's a fascinating place,  
</I>&gt;<i> and much
</I>&gt;<i> like SL, it can steal your brain.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the interest of full disclosure, I was a volunteer admin there  
</I>&gt;<i> for around
</I>&gt;<i> four years, and it finally got to be too much for me and I left  
</I>&gt;<i> (though I do
</I>&gt;<i> still maintain a simple user's presence there). It continues to be  
</I>&gt;<i> vigorous
</I>&gt;<i> in my absence ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd say start there; meet people and extend your social reach into the
</I>&gt;<i> space. You'll find a fairly vigorous 'Welcome Area' community there,  
</I>&gt;<i> not
</I>&gt;<i> unlike SL's. They will be able to provide you with some good jumping- 
</I>&gt;<i> off
</I>&gt;<i> points.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Good luck, and feel free to give a shout out to me if you have  
</I>&gt;<i> additional
</I>&gt;<i> questions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers!

&gt;<i> Hey Garret,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I understand the disappointment in lack of culture, well in truth the
</I>&gt;<i> lack of a world at all. Opensim is a bunch of Coalesced servers with
</I>&gt;<i> very few actually active grids like Second Life. My company along  
</I>&gt;<i> with a
</I>&gt;<i> non profit educational organization is trying to create a grid that  
</I>&gt;<i> wont
</I>&gt;<i> exactly mirror secondlife but will provide culture, art, community. we
</I>&gt;<i> want to turn the opensim framework into a usable, stable environment
</I>&gt;<i> that can then be built up as a grand world much like second life has
</I>&gt;<i> been over the past few years.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you would like to join us in that let me know :) you can always  
</I>&gt;<i> shoot
</I>&gt;<i> me an email or check out <A HREF="http://pawzgroup.com">http://pawzgroup.com</A> or <A HREF="http://atmeeting.com">http://atmeeting.com</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Loralai Aya
