Hi David.  As it happens, I've started to look at osNPC*() functions in the last couple of weeks (e.g. commits 22f25fa, 
ed12e38) with a view to eventually restoring the original functionality and buttressing it with some automated 
regression tests.  I would also love to see the code in a state where NPCs would work without a client object attached.

At the moment in git master, say, create and delete work, though appearance and autopilot are broken.  For an 
experienced OpenSim developer fixing appearance shouldn't be too hard - I think it's a case of digging around to find 
out why the copied avatar baked textures aren't being used properly on the NPC.

Fixing autopilot is more difficult.  In principle, it should use much the same code paths as sit and &quot;go here&quot; on 
version 1 viewers, though &quot;go here&quot; itself doesn't appear to be working consistently.  It's probably a case of fixing go 
and then reusing the code for npc autopilot.  This would be somewhat involved, more so than fixing appearance.  Fixing 
autopilot of NPCs should also fix it for client-side bots.

Any resource to help fix these would be very welcome.  I have to confess, they are low down on my priority list right now.
