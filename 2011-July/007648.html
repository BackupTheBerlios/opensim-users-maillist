<PRE>As for what I did wrong, this is for others who feel stuck and can't 
seem to get anywhere with murmur and whisper.  It don't seem to help 
with imprudence 1.4, but it does get old Hippo working fine.  I was so 
happy to find I had a dot and when I spoke into my mic, yay I had talk 
lines and my AV mouth was moving.

What a relief, I was so happy.  One thing was in the [murmurvoice] 
section of my opensim.ini I put to much in the murmur_host    =  entry.  
I typed in the <A HREF="http://myserver.datanameserver.com/">http://myserver.datanameserver.com/</A>  As it turned out 
only putting in  myserver.datanameserver.com

I opened my ports in my router, but let windows 7 ask me if I wanted to 
allow murmur to get in and out of my firewall and left it at that. I 
needed to open the ports that go with ice and any other newly added dll 
with opensim's voice system.

Then it never came up in my Imprudence, but did as soon as I loaded the 
old Hippo.  So now wondering if theree is any kind of fix coming and how 
to make it a little easier on me running 49 regions to allow people to 
easily turn voice on and off in any of my regions.

Have fun all anbd thanks. If it wasn't for all you, I owuld be voiceles 
and man6other missing things.

Sincerely, you all rock!
InuYasha.
