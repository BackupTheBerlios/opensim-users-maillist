<PRE>I was able to adjust the viewer debug setting RenderVolumeLODFactor 
and adjust it from the default 1.0 to 4.0 and the vehicle renders 
reasonably now as the view distance gets progressively greater.

Some guidance on LOD settings and rendering can be seen at 
<A HREF="http://blog.nalates.net/2011/05/24/revised-sl-mesh-arriving/">http://blog.nalates.net/2011/05/24/revised-sl-mesh-arriving/</A>

  But relatively large sub meshes were dropping out at far too short 
a distance, and meshes uploaded in an earlier 2.7.2 viewer looked 
fine.. so something has altered.

I appreciate this thread might be better reported under LL/Second 
Life viewer forums and JIRA.  But if anyone else has thoughts or 
observations here on the OpenSim list, please add your notes.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>The other thing I have noticed is that there is a change in the 
</I>&gt;<i>rendering in world of my complex meshes between LL 2.7.2 and 2.7.4 
</I>&gt;<i>viewers.  For ones UPLOADED in 2.7.2 (or Kirstens S21 RC1) on 
</I>&gt;<i>OpenSim r/16234 they render fine in both 2.7.2 and 2.7.4 viewers 
</I>&gt;<i>with LOD handled well as you zoom out.  BUT, for ones uploaded in LL 
</I>&gt;<i>2.7.4 (exactly the same model, and exactly the same OpenASim.exe 
</I>&gt;<i>server), the LOD is handled poorly, and soe quite large parts of the 
</I>&gt;<i>meshes disappear even when only zooming out 30-60 metres.  It looks 
</I>&gt;<i>bad.  See the three progressively more zoomed out examples here for 
</I>&gt;<i>the LL 2.7.4 uploaded mesh, whereeas the vehicle looks the same with 
</I>&gt;<i>all parts intact at all three zoom distances with a LL 2.7.2 viewer 
</I>&gt;<i>uploaded mesh
