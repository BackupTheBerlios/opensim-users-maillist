<PRE>A quick update on progress with Mesh viewers and use in OpenSim..

Since the upgrade yesterday from LL 2.7.4 to 2.7.5 and the LL Beta 
Viewer upgrade to 2.8.1, the mesh upload options no longer appear in 
the inventory area or the build -&gt; upload menu. for those specific 
viewers, probably to get ready for the roll out of mesh more widely 
on the main grid and to prevent issues if everyone had access to teh 
feature straight away.  A group is available called &quot;Mesh Volunteers&quot; 
to join in SL to allow access to the main grid Mesh Sandbox regions now.

See <A HREF="http://blog.nalates.net/2011/07/21/second-life-mesh-volunteers-group/">http://blog.nalates.net/2011/07/21/second-life-mesh-volunteers-group/</A>
       <A HREF="https://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Mesh/LiveVolunteers">https://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Mesh/LiveVolunteers</A>

It seems that only the &quot;Project Viewer - Mes&quot; is now mesh/model 
upload enabled at present.  I tested with Second Life 2.8.1 (236285) 
Jul 20 2011 11:02:47

There is a new stage of calculating the costs of upload, which 
involved the model being sent to the server I noted. I was pleased to 
see that stage worked in OpenSim - rightly giving a zero cost.  Then 
the Upload button becomes available after that stage.

The good news is that the meshes I am testing, which are quite 
complex, still upload and rez fine in OpenSim 0.7.2 dev r/16324 in 
OSGrid (on one of our own hosted region) and on the Openvue grid.

If you use the new 2.7.5 or current 2.8.1 beta viewer though, meshes 
will now not show at all now (they did in 2.7.4 and the previous 
Beta), or show some prim elements.

Hope these notes are helpful to others, Ai
