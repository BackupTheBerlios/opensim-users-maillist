<PRE>
Dear colleagues,

(My apologies yet again for cross posting.)

This is a reminder that proposals (1-2 pages) for the forthcoming book on Virtual Worlds in Open and Distance Education, to be published by Athabasca University Press as part of Terry Anderson's Issues in Distance Education Series, are due on July 22, 2011.

Two types of chapters will be published in the book, namely chapters addressing specific themes and issues related to the use of virtual worlds in online and distance education (5,000-8,000 words) and chapters reporting on case studies of the use of virtual worlds in online and distance education (2,000-4,000 words). The book will be published online as an Open Access publication as well as in print.

For more information, including suggested topic areas, submission procedure and timelines, please see the Call for Chapter Proposals at <A HREF="http://www.virtualclassrooms.info/vwwg/vwwgbook.html">http://www.virtualclassrooms.info/vwwg/vwwgbook.html</A>
