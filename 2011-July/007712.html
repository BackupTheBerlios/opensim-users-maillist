&gt;<i> This looks promising, tried to register but the activation keys seem to be having issues and I can't log in.
</I>
Sorted this now, stupidity on my part.


&gt;<i> Your comment, &quot;...the whole Linden thing just annoys me...&quot; gave me a
</I>&gt;<i> chuckle.  That is, I continue to admire the work of colleagues that remained
</I>&gt;<i> in SL as well as acknowledge how some things [namely voice and just for the
</I>&gt;<i> moment] works better in SL than in the OS.  At the same time, the high cost
</I>&gt;<i> of SL coupled with the frequent and abrupt changes in SL management
</I>&gt;<i> motivated me to make the move to the OS (and I couldn't be happier now that
</I>&gt;<i> the move is complete!).
</I>
Hi Kay, The thing that annoys me most is the stupid model of running second life, it reminds me of the early web, domain names and hosting and initially extortionate prices.  Since linden labs host all islands prices never go down, there is no healthy competition, even though memory capacity is constantly going up.  I'm unsure as to why they don't allow others to host, it would increase the falling user base, ease things that they don't like doing like patrolling the spaces for incorrect use and with a change of their business model they would reap far more money in other ways. Their business model is antiquated when compared with the likes of Google.

Anyway for all this and more Opensim is potentially far more interesting.


&gt;<i> For my view of the lack of community in the OS, I think there is plenty
</I>&gt;<i> going on but a central calendar would be a boost when it comes to finding
</I>&gt;<i> out about events, exhibits, content, etc.  Also, for the calendar to be of
</I>&gt;<i> maximum use, my view is that it needs to be attached to the OpenSim.org
</I>&gt;<i> site (rather than attached to any of the individual grids in the OS).
</I>
Yes a calendar of events would be a huge help and I agree completely that it should be at opensim.org to be impartial to all grids or it should be run by a group who are not connected to any single initiative.
