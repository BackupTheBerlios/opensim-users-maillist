<PRE>Unfortunately, this is a very hard (maybe impossible) problem in a distributed system.  You would have to chase down all 
asset references that remote regions hold.  This is difficult when the regions are hosted on different machines, let 
alone when they are hosted by different people.

It's more feasible on a standalone, since all the data is in one database.  One would need to write a tool that chases 
down all the references that assets and inventory items hold to each other.  This is essentially what OAR/IAR saving 
does, so one could reuse the code in OpenSim if one is using a CLR language.  This could run as a separate executable - 
it's probably not suitable to be in the runtime itself.

However, it has restricted application, which is probably why it hasn't been done yet.

There are other ways to reduce the asset database size.  The chief one is to detect identical assets and eliminate them. 
  This is what Dave Coyle's asset data service SRAS does by calculating hashes for the assets 
(<A HREF="https://github.com/coyled/sras">https://github.com/coyled/sras</A>).  The asset service bundled with OpenSim should do this too at some point.

Loading the same OARs and IARs should not bloat the database since the asset is not duplicated if the UUID is the same. 
  If loading an *AR twice can be shown to be expanding the asset db twice, then this is a fileable bug.
