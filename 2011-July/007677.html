<PRE>Hi All

Never really took the time to introduce myself and this list has been  
very helpful in setting up our OpenSim regions, I know the educators  
list (<A HREF="https://lists.secondlife.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/educators">https://lists.secondlife.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/educators</A>)  
are keen on introductions - it's a good idea to see what people are  
doing.

So for my part overdue, here goes...

I'm an artist and an academic (in that order) and have migrated over  
from Second Life where I've been very active in the arts community.   
Most recently doing a residency&quot; <A HREF="http://www.asquare.org/works/yoshikaze-up-in-the-air-second-life-residency">http://www.asquare.org/works/yoshikaze-up-in-the-air-second-life-residency</A> 
  (see links below for more on what I do).

Interested in extending my practice into OpenSim - the whole Linden  
thing just annoys me, too costly and am a big supporter of anything  
opensource as I can get my hands dirty so to speak.  Very hopeful  
about the future of OpenSim, and the approach of a post alpha  
version.  But I'm also keen to bring my students into OpenSim.  I've  
set up a four region space, search for:

CCI Sandbox Sim
CCI Gallery Sim
CCI New Media Sim
CCI Moving Image Sim

The regions are ready but we are still working on getting the server  
to auto restart when it crashes so bear with us.  They already have  
open access sandboxs and a gallery (similar to spaces in Second Life  
like Art Nation).

There is an ulterior motive for all of this...

What I am a little disappointed about is the lack of overall culture  
in OpenSim which is present in Second Life, from my point of view an  
arts community, running exhibitions, performances, symposium,  
workshops etc.  Groups don't seem to be as successful as they are in  
Second Life and I've not come across any mailing lists for this -  
perhaps I'm totally wrong and somebody can point some out to me?

Any artists on this list who are looking for a culture on OpenSim?   
Anyone who wants to start getting initiates together?

Garrett
