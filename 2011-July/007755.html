<PRE>Firstly, apologies for cross-posting. Some of you will have seen variants of this message elsewhere.



I am trying to facilitate a brief and informal meeting of educators using OpenSim as well as educators interested in exploring its potential. The format is currently evolving via discussion in the Hypergrid Adventurers Club Google Group but the meetup is intended to be primarily inworld and is likely to take place on New World Grid (where I will host) and OSGrid (John Rogate to host).



As things stand, the first part of the meeting will probably focus mainly on poster presentations regarding work planned or underway in individual regions and grids against the unifying background of the Hypergrid. Subsequently there will probably be some brief presentations (Justin Clark-Casey has kindly agreed to participate) and perhaps a panel-led Q&amp;A. The motivation is to identify ways in which educators on disparate grids might be helped to realise the educational potential of the OpenSim environment.



I probably haven't expressed that very well but hopefully you get the drift. ;)



We have a date set, viz 9th September, and at this stage I would welcome expressions of interest from those likely to attend so we can gauge whether there is sufficient demand. Ideas welcome too.



Best wishes
