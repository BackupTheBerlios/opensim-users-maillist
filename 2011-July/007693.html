<PRE>I think getting more people is critical.

This is why I find the Hypergrid idea so interesting.  If people from different installations of OpenSim can just cross 
to other installations then every new OpenSim server adds more population to the whole system (network effect).  Things 
become more like the web.

At the moment, there are big challenges due to architectural/security limitations (e.g. having to route everything 
through the servers, the 4096 region bug, etc.).

Another idea which I think might help is a website listing events taking place on different grids or even virtual 
environments.  Then there's one single place for people to find out where others might actually be gathering.  Then the 
challenge becomes easily accessing those spaces.

</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for your reply. I meant to say the regions I mentioned are all on OSgrid. I've been using OpenSim (front and
</I>&gt;<i> back) for about 5 months now so tech wise feel pretty comfortable with it. Any people I've stumbled on in world are
</I>&gt;<i> usually having very techy conversations (which is understandable since it's still Apha and we are all setting up our
</I>&gt;<i> servers) but I just worry what happens when it's stable and everyone has a space - it will come. What do we all do then?
</I>&gt;<i> If there is nothing to do in world then people will drift away, tech challenges will only last so long so this is really
</I>&gt;<i> all about sustainability/longevity of the 'place' of OpenSim. If anything keeps Second Life going it's the culture,
</I>&gt;<i> attending things, meeting people whatever your thing is there is a culture for it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I understand people are investing an enormous amount of time and energy into OpenSim to get it working and the work so
</I>&gt;<i> far is phenomenal (genuinely well done) but other things need to get rolling to sustain it all. Loralai, what your
</I>&gt;<i> company seem to be doing is great. It would be good to see that provision of culture, art, community happening across
</I>&gt;<i> existing grids as well. Having it on your own grid is fine but the whole issue of moving from one grid to another is
</I>&gt;<i> still far from easy so yet another grid at the moment will just mean competition and risks seclusion. When crossing
</I>&gt;<i> grids works, having a set of regions (because hopefully the 'border crossing' will be transparent) that specialise in
</I>&gt;<i> culture, art, community will do well but I suspect that at the moment its a case of it needs to be taken to where the
</I>&gt;<i> users are.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> James, are you a practicing artist in OpenSim? Would love to see anything you have done.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi Garrett,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Firstly, Welcome to the wild and wacky world of OpenSims!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm also an artist, a half-assed academic (sorry!) and have a LOT of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> experience with OpenSims, SecondLife, &amp;etc.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My SL rezday is back in Dec of 2004, and I confess I havent logged in to SL
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in some years, due to my extensive involvement with OpenSims.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> First thing to know, is that the topologicla space is a bit different here.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> With SL, you have a company producing a product, and they more or less try
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to 'contain and control' (with more or less succes), all of the technical,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> economic, and social aspects of their virtual world. With OpenSims, there
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are three primary communities; Developers, Testers, and Early Adopters. Each
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of these has one or more distinct communities surrounding it, and there is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> both considerable overlap between them and some odd instances of isolation.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Perhaps the most high profile community (and it is made up of a good many
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> subcommunities) is on OSgrid (<A HREF="seehttp://osgrid.org">seehttp://osgrid.org</A>). It is fast, fun,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> furious, unstable, high risk, almost completely anonymous; verily, a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> conundrum made up of upturned wormcans. It's a fascinating place, and much
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> like SL, it can steal your brain.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In the interest of full disclosure, I was a volunteer admin there for around
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> four years, and it finally got to be too much for me and I left (though I do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> still maintain a simple user's presence there). It continues to be vigorous
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in my absence ;)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'd say start there; meet people and extend your social reach into the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> space. You'll find a fairly vigorous 'Welcome Area' community there, not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unlike SL's. They will be able to provide you with some good jumping-off
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> points.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Good luck, and feel free to give a shout out to me if you have additional
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> questions.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Cheers!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> James
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> aka Hiro Protagonist

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hey Garret,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I understand the disappointment in lack of culture, well in truth the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> lack of a world at all. Opensim is a bunch of Coalesced servers with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> very few actually active grids like Second Life. My company along with a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> non profit educational organization is trying to create a grid that wont
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exactly mirror secondlife but will provide culture, art, community. we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> want to turn the opensim framework into a usable, stable environment
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that can then be built up as a grand world much like second life has
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> been over the past few years.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If you would like to join us in that let me know :) you can always shoot
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> me an email or check <A HREF="outhttp://pawzgroup.comorhttp://atmeeting.com">outhttp://pawzgroup.comorhttp://atmeeting.com</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
