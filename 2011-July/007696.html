<PRE>Personally I am a retired software engineer having fun with the
technology. I gave up Second Life several years ago when they started
getting restrictive and having periodic panics.

I think you will find the various OpenSim worlds to be a very mixed bag
- there is certainly no central or unifying &quot;culture&quot; of any sort.


Probably the best introduction to some of the larger grids is
<A HREF="http://www.hyperica.com/">http://www.hyperica.com/</A> and <A HREF="http://thehypergates.com/">http://thehypergates.com/</A>

I am sure there are a dozen other good ones, but these cover most of the
popular grids.

In addition there are literally thousands of &quot;private&quot; grids for any
number of special purposes - I ran a standalone &quot;Mars Sim&quot; grid for a
Sci Fi convention for example. You got to suit up an dexplore Mars - I
forgot and left the editing capability on and several kids got on and
transformed Mars in a couple of hours! They had a great time (as did the
spectators) and I just restored everything from backups when we were done.

The Hypergrid is definitely getting to be a way to explore new &quot;worlds&quot;
with various paradigms, although it has had some teething problems with
incompatible format changes recently.

If you want to jump right in then I suggest looking at Diva's D2 distro
from: <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Main_Page">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Main_Page</A>  It gives you a very
simple pre-set up starter grid of your very own, download one of the
Hypergates and you are on your way!

When I set up the Mars sim, one of the first visitors was a &quot;little
green man&quot; (literally!) from VUE who dropped over to say hi. :-)

Good Luck

Karen
