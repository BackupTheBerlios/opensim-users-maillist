Actually, that's not what I (the original poster) wanted.  The car doesn't have to function at all.  It's just going to be parked in a certain position on a (virtual) road.  We're looking for any generic kind of car you'd see these days, and also for models of a Jeep, a van, a bus and a truck (lorry), or anything that would be recognised as those.  The modelling doesn't have to be perfect: it can use angles rather than smooth curves, and can be cubical instead of tapered, it just has to be something you'd catch a glimpse of and recognise, the more convincing the better.

I could arrange a small amount of money if you could supply all these, but if you can supply any of them and permission to use them I can promise a credit in any research we do that uses the model.  Your name can appear in an academic paper for helping do SCIENCE !

Thanks for any help.

Simon.
