&quot;The proper etiquette in this situation would have been to clearly
identify a bot that&quot;

Totally agree, and hopefully the bot's owners will respond to my email
with a change in that direction.


&quot;rather than disabling hypergrid , remove the gate.  No more spybot.&quot;

I had NO idea the gate was in any way involved with this at all, it never
occurred to me because of two reasons- I assumed since May this was a
PERSON, absolutely nothing indicated to me  till just the other day. The
other because HG does not require a HG gate at all, I had a HG gate out in
part for ME to use, but also to have my regions listed in the hypergates
index where there was a description about the region.


 &quot; The 'hurry, everyone barricade the doors and shutter the windows'
approach is archaic and counterproductive. &quot;

I'm not sure where that's coming from, this was not a panic/hurry and shut
the door thing, it has been going on since May- seven months. I really
don't know what else a region owner can do that I hadn't already done-
multiple IM's and local chats on multiple occasions brought no responses,
HG TP to the apparent origination point- infinitegrid, finding the profile
there, sending an IM and NC directly (as they don't seem to cross the HG)
also brought no responses.

Sending an IM and NC to the admin there twice in-world about the four
gates and that account, brought no response of any kind.  I was able to
physically move the four gates up into the sky out of view which stopped
the errant traffic, and I IM'd the gate owner (assume the grid admin or
staff) about that action and why I moved them, no response to that either.

I posted on the OSgrid forum in November about this in the  thread:

 &quot;Re: Why are people disabling HG?&quot;

and that also brought no response.

Someone else on the forum posted about this user as well, it was explained
the HG visitor was probably taking freebies, but nothing about this
Sweet.JaneX@;

&quot;who is infinitegrid.org and why are they d/l my assets&quot;

Then last week I finally decided to do some more legwork on this and that
started with  googling the name, finding a bunch of mantis reports which
included crash errors and more- all having that account involved in the
logs, then posting here about it, and emailing the infinitegrid's ADMIN
contact from their web site about the gates and this user.
That brought a rather tart response in the tone of &quot;how DARE I even have
the audacity to ask about a copybot as a possibility&quot;


From: marceled9@

&quot;Maybe the AllowedClients and DeniedClients can help you keeping bots from
your grid?
And offcouse you are the one who sets the rules on your grid.&quot;

I have no idea how to use those, and this bot was deliberately set up as a
user account with a profile that was at least partially filled out, it
said &quot;free land for real builders&quot; in the profile, the rest blank, but
then that's pretty common- seems hardly anyone ever fills them out, or
very minimally if they do.


&quot;It is hard to determine the rules before you tp to a grid though, and the
hg is an open thing. Can't blame others for having other interests and
looking for things wich are not there.&quot;

Exactly, and that would be the responsibility of the person who set the
gates out on the city of doors' landing plaza- to include some kind of
descriptions. The destination region owners cant do that- the gates were
on someone else's grid and totally under their control, and as I
mentioned- they never responded to anything till the other day when I sent
an actual email through their infinitegrid web site contact. Sure can't
blame the visitors for  walking thru unmarked gates to see what's there, I
was polite and welcoming to those I happened to have contact with, but
clearly they found themselves on the wrong region.

&quot;I would just place a sign next to the hypergate wich states the rules so
that the people looking for clothing and adult things know they are on the
wrong place,&quot;

That would have been perfect, if the infinitegrid's gate owner had done
something like that. I only had a HG on one region, mostly for me to use,
the four gates on the other grid directed people to three of my regions
and those didn't have gates on them.

For some reason those HG visitors always seemed to land at 128,128 despite
having a set landing point and information set out at the LP area.
Some visitors land at the 128,128 center and others land at the set LP, I
assume it has to do with whether someone used a LM,  or used the map
instead.
