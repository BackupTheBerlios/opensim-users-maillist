I don't think this is an NPCcrowd issue.

I have seen it with just one or two NPC in a test region.  I think it 
has something to do with the slope of the land.  It happens even on 
the gently slope of the default round hump island. Once an NPC starts 
sliding, its legs bend up at awkward angles and it begins hopping up 
and down. I even tried to stand my real avatar in front to stop it 
running underwater... and the NPC jumped right up and over me.  IThe 
hopping contnues until they hit a terrain trough (which is usually underwater).

I think Justin might be right that its an NPC issue.

in general OpenSim avatars are very much more &quot;slidy&quot; on the ground 
asnd on slopes (like they are on ice) compared to the same behaviour in SL.
