<PRE>Probably the best statues would be mesh, so whoever makes them for 
Second Life could equally well, possibly,
sell you one for openSim, although concern for theft may dampen their 
interest.

But, there are a number of sites that have mesh objects in various 
formats that can be transformed to collada .dae format if that's what 
you can import and show in your sim.

One is <A HREF="http://www.turbosquid.com">http://www.turbosquid.com</A>
You can search it for &quot;sculpture&quot;, to get an idea of what's out there.

Be prepared for price shock, however, as the prices are in dollars, not 
lindens, so
nice sculptures will cost you $20-$100 US.    I saw a number of what 
struck me as probably neoclassical Greek.
(Of course, I was raised as an engineer, so what do I know.)  There were 
a few that looked Babylonian too.

I don't really see how someone could custom build one for you for less 
unless they give their time away.    You may need to pay someone to get 
the formats adjusted and do the importing for you of course, but you 
have some handle on the total cost to expect.

Let me know what else you find!
