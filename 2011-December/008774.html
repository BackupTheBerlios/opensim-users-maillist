<PRE>Hi Klaus
I wish you had posted this a week ago LOL.

We just loaded that up into ScienceSim in a non mega region format. Mic
Bowman from Intel loaded the OARs. Not sure what he did but it loaded up
well  but...
I found almost all of the items were phantom which I solved by walking
around and taking a copy manually which seemed to just reset them to
normal. I didn't have to put the copy out or anything, just went through
the process of right clicking and taking a copy seemed to stop me from
being able to walk through them. A script in the database would have been
an elegant solution but was not available to me as I don't run the grid and
I can't script.

There are lots of really huge prims that cross not only parcel boundaries
but sim boundaries. Some of these were problematic to make not phantom
using my very non technical method of just copying even when done from
either side of the sim boundary to test if they were linked to one sim or
the other. These I just made shorter and placed a new one the other side of
the sim boundary.

A few items just vaporized after a couple of days. For example, the podium
in the amphitheater and the screen on the stage just vanished. They are
nowhere near a sim boundary but I had not taken a copy of them.

The permissions are all set to Nebadon as owner and creator. Some items
won't let me edit them and of course if I mess something up, I don't have
the textures to fix it.

Most of the more complex scripts don't work like the automatic flag and log
changers. I thought these would work at least on the sim they were located
on but they don't work at all.

 Simpler scripts like the rotation scripts for the swimming fish or the
lighthouse light rotation that are embedded int he object they relate to
are working fine though.

I don't know if any of the items that look like video screens work yet.

I'd welcome any advice on using this amazing and really useful build. I am
grateful to the creators as our informal-science based virtual world for
girls got off to a great start with this.

thanks
Lindy

&gt;<i> Hallo
