<PRE>To whom it may concern.
I am a part of a research team from Sheffield Hallam University and as part of our research, we want to design a cyber campus using OpenSim MUVE. For this, we need to come up with a report to provide to the IT team of the university in order to provide us the required hardware and software tools to continue.
As people in this mailing list are involved with OpenSim and some of them have good technical knowledge, i would like to have some more information regarding the disk space usage of the opensim application.
Assuming that we will deploy the application server on a virtual machine within the university network infrastructure, we need to be able to specify a required disk space to be allocated to us. From your experiences as developers of OpenSim, what is a reasonable disk space to request, keeping in mind the fact that this project will run for 3 years, have interaction with 20-25 users approx, will not give the ability to users to build other objects apart from the buildings that will be provided by us.
I know that there is no correct answer here but if possible, please share some of your developing experiences. How likely is for MySQL to start growing dangerously after people will start to interact with each other etc.?
Thanks for your time.
