&quot;You banned a bot avatar wich apparently is doing nothing ?&quot;

I had no idea it WAS a bot till yesterday, and even then I only suspected
it was a bot due to it's landing on my region not 3 hours after turning HG
back on from being disabled more than 3 weeks, and then TP'ing out as soon
as I moved.

&quot;Yeah imagine that the bot has strange intensions. Could but true.&quot;

Like I said, I assumed since last May that this was a PERSON and their
actions were very odd. It has a profile on OSgrid as &quot;Sweet JaneX&quot; and the
profile is mostly empty except for this: &quot;free land for real builders.&quot;
So again, it appeared to be a registered user on OSgrid, yet it originated
from a HG origin as &quot;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-users">Sweet.JaneX at infinitegrid.org</A>&quot; and then the domain
name changed to an ip address recently, which in my mind suggests someone
trying to avoid a ban on the domain name by changing to a different host
using a different IP.

&quot;In fact a hypergrid enabled grid has an open door, that means they can
hypergrid to your grid withouth having an account on your grid.&quot;

I don't care if someone has an account on the grid or not, my regions are
public access, the only thing that concerned me about THIS user was the
very strange behaviour since May on my regions and specifically going out
of it's way to avoid any and all contact with me.
A normal user would land near you on your region, certainly notice you are
standing there, and when you say &quot;hello, welcome&quot; you'd expect they would
say something like &quot;hi, thank you,&quot; or something.

&quot;But no one i forcing you to enabling the hg. You could disable it so that
no bad bots can enter your grid withouth having an account on your sim.&quot;

I think you meant &quot;grid&quot;, my sims dont issue accounts, the grid does.
HG increases traffic, usually in a good way, but having -&gt;four&lt;- gates
with no description of any kind of them, on a foreign grid's landing sim
all sending random traffic- (a number wearing scripted genitals and sex
huds) to a PG rated EDU region looking for clothing and adult things, is a
total waste.

This was the only bot I've seen, and it turned out to not be an avatar
with bad or suspect intentions, or a bad bot either.
