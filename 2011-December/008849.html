<PRE>I noticed at least a couple or three mantis reports included the name of
someone I am trying to learn more about and what they are in my regions;

Sweet.JaneX

AKA:

<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-users">Sweet.JaneX at 204.236.242.209</A>
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-users">Sweet.JaneX at infinitegrid.org</A>

 I wanted to find out what this individual from infinite grid (she/he has an
 @infinitegrid in their user name) is doing on my regions and why this
 individual (if its not  a bot) sees me and teleports away suddenly,
avoids every attempted contact via IM or local chat and NC to inquire
what they want on my regions. This avatar
 comes to my regions and just STANDS there as though they are running a
 copybot or something, very suspicious behavior that has been going on
since last summer.

I had HG turned OFF for the last few weeks, I turned it back on last night
around 3 AM and at  6:56 AM the logs show this avatar landed on my region!


&gt;<i>From this morning;
</I>
 [06:56 AM]  IM: 128.128 NM: Sweet.JaneX @204.236.242.209 entered New
 Mexico.

 Apparently bans do not work over the HG at all for an individual, &quot;sweet
janeX&quot; is in my estate ban list but theres no way to enter the HG version
(appears to have an acct on OSgrid too) The ip ban script given to me was
set up for this ip, but it did not record any action against this avatar
this morning.

In googling this name as

 &quot;sweet.janex&quot; +opensim

 I found several mantis reports that included this name in the crash logs
and others, I am suspecting some kind of bot now, suddenly showing up
within hours of turning the HG in the ini back on smacks an awful lot
like some scripted bot is monitoring something, either my specific
regions or OSgrid itself, either way I'm finding the behaviour of this
disturbing and of concern.
