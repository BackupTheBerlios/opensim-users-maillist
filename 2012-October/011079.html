<PRE>I did briefly consider running a cross-grid event for OpenSim educators. On the other hand there hasn't historically been a shortage of virtual world conferences for educators with VWBPE being a notable fixture with a reasonable level of multi-platform support (Minecraft and WoW as well as SL, OpenSim and Jibe). ReactionGrid also ran their own multi-platform IndieMetaverse edu conference over the last few years; I've no idea whether that will continue given their focus on Jibe. SLACTIONS is a hybrid event, inworld in SL and RL <A HREF="http://www.slactions.org/">http://www.slactions.org/</A> . Finally, there have been RL conferences like MetaMeets, and the one run by the Immersive Education Initiative (which now has a European chapter <A HREF="http://europe.immersiveeducation.org/">http://europe.immersiveeducation.org/</A>). 

On the other hand, I still think that there's a space for an OpenSim-specific edu conference (or possibly session(s) within a larger umbrella  format) that is accessible, lightweight, informal and affordable/free.

Best wishes

Peter

Subject: [Opensim-users] Metameets 2012

Hi folks.  Just wanted to let people know about the Metameets 2012 [1] conference.  This is a fun conference that I
physically attended in both 2010 and 2011 and I'll be going in body again this year.  It's virtual-world/environment
neutral and the theme this year concentrates on creation in both the physical (3D printing, etc.) and digital worlds
(virtual worlds, digital creation, novel input methods) and how these can be connected.

I'll be giving a small workshop on setting up OpenSimulator (oriented to ppl who have never heard of it before) where I
may attempt to hook a region up to osgrid temporarily, network permitting.  I'll also be on a roundtable discussion
about open-source virtual worlds.

If you're interested in learning more, please also see my blog post [2].

On another note, I think it would be good to have an OpenSimulator conference at some point in OpenSimulator itself,
maybe next year.  Of course the problems are avatar limits (maybe Intel DSG could help with that) and possible crashing
(hence would have to be an 'alpha' free conference).  However, I don't think these would stop it from being a really
valuable thing to do.
