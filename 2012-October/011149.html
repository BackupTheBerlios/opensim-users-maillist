<PRE>There is a much simpler OpenSim solution, unless there is some OTHER REASON
to teach the student about interacting with &quot;BUY&quot; objects.

Put the uniforms in the grid library.
Everyone in the grid should be able to drag the uniform folder from the
library to inventory and wear.

I believe there have been recent advances that allow IAR files to be added
directly to the grid library.

I would generate an avatar that has all of the inventory items a new
student would need, generate the IAR file for that avatar, and add it
to the grid library..

It may be confusing to explain that they can't wear things directly out of
the library, and have to copy it to inventory first, but I find that
teaching them to look in the library for things they may need is a LOT
easier than sending them to find and interact with unfamiliar in-world
objects.
