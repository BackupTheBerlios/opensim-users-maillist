<PRE>Hi folks,

I'm hoping someone can maybe generally explain how/why/when a user appears
as a cloud - to themselves or to others, though sometimes only one or the
other, sometimes both.

We're experiencing several issues with the &quot;cloud avatar&quot; problem with the
0.7.4 version of Opensim, including some behavior I hadn't seen in a while
where my avatar appears just fine but somehow loses itself during teleport,
as described in this OSGrid forum post:
<A HREF="http://forums.osgrid.org/viewtopic.php?f=14&amp;t=3147&amp;p=13803#p13803">http://forums.osgrid.org/viewtopic.php?f=14&amp;t=3147&amp;p=13803#p13803</A>

&gt;<i>From that forum thread:  &quot;Can't change appearance until clothing and shape
</I>are loaded&quot;.  Since TPing to another region yesterday, my AV has failed to
rez. When I login, I am a &quot;puffball&quot; with the &quot;...clothing is still
downloading&quot; message.  When I check &quot;Worn Items&quot;, NOTHING appears.  The
&quot;Appearance&quot; option is greyed out.  When I try to &quot;Wear&quot; any item of
clothing, any skin or shape, the error message in the subject above
appears.&quot;

In one of the most recent cloud avatar situations, the solution provided in
the thread to right click on a folder in inventory containing a new skin
and eyes, and choose &quot;Replace Outfit&quot; worked, while all the usual ways of
changing appearance wouldn't (ie to manually right click &gt; wear items, or
drag the folder onto myself).

However, we have other users who also appear as clouds but who can
seemingly edit their appearance or change clothes, but they never appear as
anything but clouds and nothing seems to help.

We use Diva's Wifi for grid registration with pre-created avatars, all of
which we have tested with multiple viewers on different PCs, and all seem
to work fine for us both in the office and at home (to account for network
lag or other issues of that sort).  We've also created 6 avatars for this
specific project, again all of which seem to work fine for us, but for some
of our users they still always appear as clouds and others see them as
clouds seemingly no matter what we do.

Any advice, troubleshooting tips, or even a basic explanation of how the
appearance stuff is communicated from the server to the viewer would be
helpful and much appreciated.

Thanks in advance!
