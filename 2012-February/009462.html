<PRE>We've seen that guy before - one useful thing you can do is disable physical primitives for public build regions by tweaking your opensim.ini file:

In the [Startup] section:

physical_prim = false

You can still walk around as normal and rez objects, but you won't end up buried in physical spheres.

Hope this helps,

Chris

I'm with Fleep here. While &quot;griefing&quot; is a nuisance, it's typically very easily remedied by either restarting the simulator, or - at worst - reverting to a previous backup. If anything, I'd encourage people to do regular backups and not neccessarily to rely on server-side restrictions that may or may not work, but will certainly make life harder for the wrong people. The griefers will find a way around them; for them it's a sport, and the harder the obstacle, the more determined they are to overcome it. I think OpenSim even has some kind of auto-backup feature lately that saves regions as OARs. (I'm using the old and dull MySQL dump that works just as well.)

&gt;<i> I'm probably asking for trouble posting to the whole wide listserv, but..
</I>&gt;<i>  I'm philosophically opposed to turning off public build unless it's 
</I>&gt;<i> truly necessary.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To me, the most important and magical aspect of the SL and Opensim 
</I>&gt;<i> platforms is the ability to collaboratively create user generated 
</I>&gt;<i> content and _to invite others to do the same_.  The possibility for a 
</I>&gt;<i> visitor to leave something creative for others to see or use 
</I>&gt;<i> (stigmergy
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigmergy">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigmergy</A>) is what sets these platforms 
</I>&gt;<i> apart from others.  I like discovering what users leave behind and 99% 
</I>&gt;<i> of the time it is not griefing activity at all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And before you say you're shocked and how that never works, we have a 
</I>&gt;<i> multi-sim mainland community in Second Life that has had public build 
</I>&gt;<i> turned on for going on 6 years.  It just requires a little extra 
</I>&gt;<i> effort to keep things tidy, and the benefits have far outweighed the 
</I>&gt;<i> risk/work required to keep the tiny minority of jerks at bay.  
</I>&gt;<i> Visitors can always open packages and play with the things they 
</I>&gt;<i> discover in our space, and they can share things with the community or 
</I>&gt;<i> even add to it - we just reserve editorial rights of course.  hehe.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In any case, the fault was really mine for not checking my sims 
</I>&gt;<i> periodically, and that was the reminder I wanted to share (and a little
</I>&gt;<i> grouching about the griefer).   But considering FleepGrid has been up for
</I>&gt;<i> over a year and a half and in that time people have left gifts, funny 
</I>&gt;<i> joke items, shared freebies, and opened lots of boxes but this is the 
</I>&gt;<i> first griefing activity I've seen..  I think that's a good argument 
</I>&gt;<i> for leaving public build on - you might be surprised at the nice 
</I>&gt;<i> things you find.  ;)  (So long as you clean up periodically!)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Hi all,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  If any of you were following the long email thread on opensim-users 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about intermittent crashing and out of memory exceptions, you may 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> recall I just figured out how to spread regions across multiple

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> em-OutofMemoryException-td7281298.html
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> .)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  So today, the HGAC folks came to visit FleepGrid and things went 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> relatively well, and after it was over I thought I'd follow Rick's 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> suggestion and load each sim one at a time to see how much memory 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they used and general performance for each region.  Considering 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> FleepGrid is running on an old P4 with 4GB RAM, I've been relatively 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pleased with its performance with around 11 regions, some of them 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with lots of content and scripts.  The only major concern has been 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the CPU consistently pegging around 75-80% usage after all the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> scripts are loaded (it always hits 100% during start up).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Imagine my surprise when I loaded each sim one at a time and was 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> seeing virtually no CPU load after the scripts finished loading, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> region after region, even when I started adding them back 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cumulatively, CPU load was hovering around 2%!  What the heck was 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> going on, I wondered, the only regions I had left to load were my 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> three hypergate regions which are basically small islands with a few 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> signs and very few scripts or objects.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Lo and behold, I added HGate 1000 and suddenly the CPU load shot 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> back up to 78% after scripts finished loading.  I couldn't imagine 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what the heck was going on with that nearly empty region but upon 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> investigation, I discovered 600 spheres set to physical under the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> waterline, each taking up precious CPU resources.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  The long and short of it is, I hadn't checked those regions in ages 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> because they're just simple hypergate jump points and I didn't think 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> anything in particular was going on there, but those darn physical 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> balls have been chewing up my CPU (and making the $#%^@$ loud fan run 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> all day and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> night) for goodness knows how long, PLUS whatever performance hit the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> whole grid suffered as a result of my inattentiveness.  Hopefully 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this will mean a lot less laggy experience on FleepGrid and a lot 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> less stress on my poor old PC (which I'm completely surprised was 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> even able to handle 600 physical objects at once!).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  So just a friendly reminder to myself and you to check your sims 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> periodically for griefer crap.  And curses to user &quot;Jack Marioline&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wherever you are.  :P
