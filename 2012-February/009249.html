<PRE>There is some rough performance information at [1].

10 avatars per region is probably about right - the biggest bottleneck at the moment is physics performance, I would 
say.  One thing to be aware of is that OpenSim 0.7.2 has an ODE crashing bug which can occur on simulators with more 
than one region.  This was addressed very recently, so you may want to wait until OpenSimulator 0.7.3 comes out. 
Hopefully this will happen late in Feb.

There is a performance test executable that comes with OpenSim called pCampBot [2].  This will log an arbitrary number 
of libomv clients on to a simulator and can perform actions such as bouncing, running and teleporting between regions. 
However, libomv generates a large amount of spew on the console (though this is probably opensim's fault).  Also, I find 
it difficult to get 20 clients to log in and stay logged in at once when running the teleport test.  This is very likely 
due to the intensive nature of this test (20 avatars constantly teleporting between simulators) but it's something that 
probably needs to be addressed.  Hopefully this wouldn't be so much of a problem in normal conditions.

pCampbot is only working in current master code.  In OpenSim 0.7.2 and quite a few releases before it is probably broken 
and even if not behaves differently.

</I>&gt;<i> My name is Peter Blair and I've emailed in the past about some of the
</I>&gt;<i> limits of standalone regions. In the past tests we've identified about
</I>&gt;<i> 18-20 avs as the limit of a standalone server running 4 regions in
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim 0.7.2.rc2 on a Intel Core i7 @ 2.8 GHz, 12 GB RAM, and a 526
</I>&gt;<i> GB hard drive. These avs were all on the same region.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We've since changed our server to grid mode Opensim 0.7.2.release.
</I>&gt;<i> Robust.exe runs on one box with three regions (Intel i7 2600K 16 gig
</I>&gt;<i> RAM) and another box is running an additional two regions (Intel Core
</I>&gt;<i> i7 @ 2.8 GHz, 12 GB RAM). I'm hoping to get 45 avatars into this grid
</I>&gt;<i> mode across the five regions. Accordingly, each of the five regions
</I>&gt;<i> would be housing about 10 avatars.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm trying to do some preliminary load testing with users but wanted
</I>&gt;<i> to ask if anyone has had experience getting this many avs into their
</I>&gt;<i> sims, grid or stand alone and what their specs were. Also if I don't
</I>&gt;<i> have the needed users to test the sim what other strategies have
</I>&gt;<i> other's used to do load testing? I'm assuming one bottle neck that
</I>&gt;<i> we've encountered is with the avs requesting textures and such from
</I>&gt;<i> the server. Is that the case?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As always, thanks for your help.
