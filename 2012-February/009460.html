<PRE>I'm probably asking for trouble posting to the whole wide listserv, but..
 I'm philosophically opposed to turning off public build unless it's truly
necessary.

To me, the most important and magical aspect of the SL and Opensim
platforms is the ability to collaboratively create user generated content
and _to invite others to do the same_.  The possibility for a visitor to
leave something creative for others to see or use (stigmergy
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigmergy">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigmergy</A>) is what sets these platforms apart
from others.  I like discovering what users leave behind and 99% of the
time it is not griefing activity at all.

And before you say you're shocked and how that never works, we have a
multi-sim mainland community in Second Life that has had public build
turned on for going on 6 years.  It just requires a little extra effort to
keep things tidy, and the benefits have far outweighed the risk/work
required to keep the tiny minority of jerks at bay.  Visitors can always
open packages and play with the things they discover in our space, and they
can share things with the community or even add to it - we just reserve
editorial rights of course.  hehe.

In any case, the fault was really mine for not checking my sims
periodically, and that was the reminder I wanted to share (and a little
grouching about the griefer).   But considering FleepGrid has been up for
over a year and a half and in that time people have left gifts, funny joke
items, shared freebies, and opened lots of boxes but this is the first
griefing activity I've seen..  I think that's a good argument for leaving
public build on - you might be surprised at the nice things you find.  ;)
 (So long as you clean up periodically!)

</I>&gt;<i>  Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  If any of you were following the long email thread on opensim-users
</I>&gt;<i> about intermittent crashing and out of memory exceptions, you may recall I
</I>&gt;<i> just figured out how to spread regions across multiple opensim instances.

</I>&gt;<i> .)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  So today, the HGAC folks came to visit FleepGrid and things went
</I>&gt;<i> relatively well, and after it was over I thought I'd follow Rick's
</I>&gt;<i> suggestion and load each sim one at a time to see how much memory they used
</I>&gt;<i> and general performance for each region.  Considering FleepGrid is running
</I>&gt;<i> on an old P4 with 4GB RAM, I've been relatively pleased with its
</I>&gt;<i> performance with around 11 regions, some of them with lots of content and
</I>&gt;<i> scripts.  The only major concern has been the CPU consistently pegging
</I>&gt;<i> around 75-80% usage after all the scripts are loaded (it always hits 100%
</I>&gt;<i> during start up).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Imagine my surprise when I loaded each sim one at a time and was seeing
</I>&gt;<i> virtually no CPU load after the scripts finished loading, region after
</I>&gt;<i> region, even when I started adding them back cumulatively, CPU load was
</I>&gt;<i> hovering around 2%!  What the heck was going on, I wondered, the only
</I>&gt;<i> regions I had left to load were my three hypergate regions which are
</I>&gt;<i> basically small islands with a few signs and very few scripts or objects.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Lo and behold, I added HGate 1000 and suddenly the CPU load shot back up
</I>&gt;<i> to 78% after scripts finished loading.  I couldn't imagine what the heck
</I>&gt;<i> was going on with that nearly empty region but upon investigation, I
</I>&gt;<i> discovered 600 spheres set to physical under the waterline, each taking up
</I>&gt;<i> precious CPU resources.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  The long and short of it is, I hadn't checked those regions in ages
</I>&gt;<i> because they're just simple hypergate jump points and I didn't think
</I>&gt;<i> anything in particular was going on there, but those darn physical balls
</I>&gt;<i> have been chewing up my CPU (and making the $#%^@$ loud fan run all day and
</I>&gt;<i> night) for goodness knows how long, PLUS whatever performance hit the whole
</I>&gt;<i> grid suffered as a result of my inattentiveness.  Hopefully this will mean
</I>&gt;<i> a lot less laggy experience on FleepGrid and a lot less stress on my poor
</I>&gt;<i> old PC (which I'm completely surprised was even able to handle 600 physical
</I>&gt;<i> objects at once!).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  So just a friendly reminder to myself and you to check your sims
</I>&gt;<i> periodically for griefer crap.  And curses to user &quot;Jack Marioline&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> wherever you are.  :P
