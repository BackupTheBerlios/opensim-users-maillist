<PRE>As an added attraction ...perhaps OSX does make a difference.

I've been running this on one of my servers where I work. Much better than the aging hardware I currently have at home.
Came home, popped up Imprudence and connected. I see all the default four &quot;hills&quot; the Diva installation put there.

So...I'll remote login to that server, re-enable mega-regions, restart OpenSim and see what happens.

Steve

&gt;<i>The Diva distro is configured to use mega regions. There are some

</I>
(Sorry, I got this in a digest and couldn't see how to reply directly. I changed from digest so I get separate posts now.)

The region numbering was certainly part of the problem.

I renumbered the regions precisely as noted below but still no joy. I remembered reading about problems with existing terrain so I removed my MySql database, recreated it, ran the Diva Configure, and the same result. Local login I see everything. Remote login and see  nothing but the starting point.


[region1]
Location = 6000,6000

[region2]
Location = 6001,6000

[region3]
Location = 6002,6000

[region4]
Location = 6000,6001

[region5]
Location = 6001,6001

[region6]
Location = 6002,6001

[region7]
Location = 6000,6002

[region8]
Location = 6001,6002

[region9]
Location = 6002,6002

[region10]
Location = 6000,6003

[region11]
Location = 6001,6003

[region12]
Location = 6002,6003

*sigh*

So, I'm going to try once more from scratch.
-Zapped the opensim database.
-Zapped my Diva directory while saving off a couple files for reference.
-Recreated 'opensim' in MySql.
-Re-installed original Diva dist.
-Modified RegionConfig.ini for ExternalHost to point to public machine name but that was all. Didn't touch MyWorld.ini.

Same results. Local is fine, remote is not.  The remote I'm using is a Mac running Imprudence, that shouldn't matter.

Added  &quot;CombineContiguousRegions =  false&quot;  to MyWorld.ini.

Restarted OpenSim...and STILL the local is fine but remote is not.

I noted that the Diva dist doesn't number regions &quot;properly&quot; according to OpenSim page &quot;<A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Setting_Up_Mega-Regions">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Setting_Up_Mega-Regions</A>&quot;, ie: sw -&gt; ne.  I renumbered them, added unique UUIDs, removed my CombineContiguousRegions=false statement from myworld.ini and restarted.

Still no go...final attempt for today.
Zapped MySql.
added CombineContiguousRegions=false.
Ran Configure and for the heck of it I put in the static IP in lieu of the public machine name.
Started...same results.

I see the &quot;mounds&quot; of the four regions on the map and can even teleport to them but I'm apparently standing on water...from a remote connection.

ports are open, megaregions disabled, unique UUIDs, regions located in proper numerical sequence although that shouldn't matter with megaregions turned off...

I'm baffled...wish I was a drinking man.

;)
