<PRE>Han,

  There are many approaches but I don't understand enough about what you 
want to accomplish.

Is your airplane simply &quot;scenery&quot;, that would have no passengers, and 
you just want it to fly around like a robot bird?

Is it a type of &quot;tour bus&quot; that you want to be able to take passengers 
around a 3-D route you have already decided and specified?

And, regardless,  how would you WANT to design a route besides 
specifying coordinates,   or at least going to desired points and 
specifying &quot;... then HERE, ...&quot; ?

One of the nicer &quot;tour bus&quot; products in Second Life lets me just move 
along the desired route and lay down temporary markers that are &quot;then 
HERE....&quot; points for the route,  but then ALSO records the coordinates 
for those in a text file (notecard)  so they can be edited later, not 
only for the order in which they are visited,  but for the TIMING.   How 
long should I pause here,  how fast should I go over this leg, etc.   
And, the script lets me toss in commands to &quot;say&quot; when I get to each 
point, so animations can be triggered when the car gets to that point.

Mostly I'm frustrated that the note cards have to be edited in-world, I 
wish they were stored in some MySQL database that I could edit without 
having to recompile the scripts and restart them every time I learn a 
little more about how the tour is going and who wants to stay longer at 
certain points.

Is THAT the sort of thing you want?
