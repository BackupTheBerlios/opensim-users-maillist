<PRE>I'm with Fleep here. While &quot;griefing&quot; is a nuisance, it's typically very  
easily remedied by either restarting the simulator, or - at worst -  
reverting to a previous backup. If anything, I'd encourage people to do  
regular backups and not neccessarily to rely on server-side restrictions  
that may or may not work, but will certainly make life harder for the  
wrong people. The griefers will find a way around them; for them it's a  
sport, and the harder the obstacle, the more determined they are to  
overcome it. I think OpenSim even has some kind of auto-backup feature  
lately that saves regions as OARs. (I'm using the old and dull MySQL dump  
that works just as well.)

&gt;<i> I'm probably asking for trouble posting to the whole wide listserv, but..
</I>&gt;<i>  I'm philosophically opposed to turning off public build unless it's  
</I>&gt;<i> truly
</I>&gt;<i> necessary.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To me, the most important and magical aspect of the SL and Opensim
</I>&gt;<i> platforms is the ability to collaboratively create user generated content
</I>&gt;<i> and _to invite others to do the same_.  The possibility for a visitor to
</I>&gt;<i> leave something creative for others to see or use (stigmergy
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigmergy">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigmergy</A>) is what sets these platforms  
</I>&gt;<i> apart
</I>&gt;<i> from others.  I like discovering what users leave behind and 99% of the
</I>&gt;<i> time it is not griefing activity at all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And before you say you're shocked and how that never works, we have a
</I>&gt;<i> multi-sim mainland community in Second Life that has had public build
</I>&gt;<i> turned on for going on 6 years.  It just requires a little extra effort  
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> keep things tidy, and the benefits have far outweighed the risk/work
</I>&gt;<i> required to keep the tiny minority of jerks at bay.  Visitors can always
</I>&gt;<i> open packages and play with the things they discover in our space, and  
</I>&gt;<i> they
</I>&gt;<i> can share things with the community or even add to it - we just reserve
</I>&gt;<i> editorial rights of course.  hehe.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In any case, the fault was really mine for not checking my sims
</I>&gt;<i> periodically, and that was the reminder I wanted to share (and a little
</I>&gt;<i> grouching about the griefer).   But considering FleepGrid has been up for
</I>&gt;<i> over a year and a half and in that time people have left gifts, funny  
</I>&gt;<i> joke
</I>&gt;<i> items, shared freebies, and opened lots of boxes but this is the first
</I>&gt;<i> griefing activity I've seen..  I think that's a good argument for leaving
</I>&gt;<i> public build on - you might be surprised at the nice things you find.  ;)
</I>&gt;<i>  (So long as you clean up periodically!)
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Hi all,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  If any of you were following the long email thread on opensim-users
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about intermittent crashing and out of memory exceptions, you may  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> recall I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> just figured out how to spread regions across multiple opensim  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> instances.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  (If you missed the thread, see
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://opensim-users.2152040.n2.nabble.com/Intermittent-crashing-System-OutofMemoryException-td7281298.html">http://opensim-users.2152040.n2.nabble.com/Intermittent-crashing-System-OutofMemoryException-td7281298.html</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> .)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  So today, the HGAC folks came to visit FleepGrid and things went
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> relatively well, and after it was over I thought I'd follow Rick's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> suggestion and load each sim one at a time to see how much memory they  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> used
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and general performance for each region.  Considering FleepGrid is  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> running
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on an old P4 with 4GB RAM, I've been relatively pleased with its
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> performance with around 11 regions, some of them with lots of content  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> scripts.  The only major concern has been the CPU consistently pegging
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> around 75-80% usage after all the scripts are loaded (it always hits  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 100%
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> during start up).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Imagine my surprise when I loaded each sim one at a time and was seeing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> virtually no CPU load after the scripts finished loading, region after
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> region, even when I started adding them back cumulatively, CPU load was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hovering around 2%!  What the heck was going on, I wondered, the only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> regions I had left to load were my three hypergate regions which are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> basically small islands with a few signs and very few scripts or  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> objects.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Lo and behold, I added HGate 1000 and suddenly the CPU load shot back  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> up
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to 78% after scripts finished loading.  I couldn't imagine what the heck
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> was going on with that nearly empty region but upon investigation, I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> discovered 600 spheres set to physical under the waterline, each taking  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> up
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> precious CPU resources.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  The long and short of it is, I hadn't checked those regions in ages
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> because they're just simple hypergate jump points and I didn't think
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> anything in particular was going on there, but those darn physical balls
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have been chewing up my CPU (and making the $#%^@$ loud fan run all day  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> night) for goodness knows how long, PLUS whatever performance hit the  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> whole
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> grid suffered as a result of my inattentiveness.  Hopefully this will  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mean
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a lot less laggy experience on FleepGrid and a lot less stress on my  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> poor
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> old PC (which I'm completely surprised was even able to handle 600  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> physical
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> objects at once!).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  So just a friendly reminder to myself and you to check your sims
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> periodically for griefer crap.  And curses to user &quot;Jack Marioline&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wherever you are.  :P
