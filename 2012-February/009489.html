<PRE>I don't know the fix to your problem.  &quot;Segmentation error&quot; has to be a 
key phrase there.

But a common reason for systems that work fine to &quot;suddenly break&quot; is 
that some process that has been quietly filling up some space in the 
background finally ran out of space. A popular thing to run out of is 
auto-backup space, or a backup log.

&quot;Out of space&quot; errors can be messy and often present as some entirely 
different problem.

We had a problem on one system running out of space that still showed 
20% empty that had us scratching our heads for a while.   Turns out that 
our use was fragmenting the empty space into ever smaller pieces, and 
while we still had space, it was all fragmented into such small pieces 
that no piece was large enough to fit the new extent size some program 
needed.    Solution to that:  defragment the disk. (Not a bad idea in 
general.)

Not a bad idea to defragment tables too, in general, if they have a lot 
of changes.  I've read that MySQL doesn't need to do that.  I remain 
skeptical. :)

One system we had was working fine and suddenly hung. I checked and 
there were 32,767 people in the database.    Some variable had been set 
to 8 bit and it had run out of room in the FIELD to add one more.

Clean, groom, throw out the trash, defragment ... all good housekeeping 
ideas in general.
