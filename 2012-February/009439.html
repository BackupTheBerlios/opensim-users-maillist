Depends on what you're looking to do.  An EBS-backed EC2 instance gets you the ability to shut your EC2 instance down when you're not using it, pay only the EBS per-GB fees for your disk image while it's shut down, and fire it back up when you desire.  EBS volumes are also easy to snapshot for backups.  If you're looking to set up a sim that only runs part time this could be a good fit.

If you're looking to run your own grid then EBS and, with some work, S3 give you the ability to grow your storage needs for assets, etc., as you need them.  If you're running the ROBUST grid services you can run multiple instances of, say, the inventory service and stick them behind ELB.  You could also use Amazon's RDS (hosted MySQL instances) if it satisfied a need, but i/o performance isn't always great so depending on your needs you might be better served by running on a dedicated server somewhere.
