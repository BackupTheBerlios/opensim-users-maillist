<PRE>Folks,

I'm usually behind the curve on such things since my own research uses
OpenSim but relies solely on its V-World aspects and capacity to support
client-side V-Agents.  But, things have come up and I now have to ask
(again) for advice.

One of our classes at GMU &quot;needs&quot; to be able to import fully built - but not
necessarily textured - buildings.  We thought perhaps we could use the
Google libraries.  But, when we married OS0.7.3 to SL1.23 - SL3.xx and the
latest stable Imprudence, we were unable to rezz let alone upload our
&quot;sample set&quot; of meshies.  Of course, we may be inept ... but we did try.

Can anyone tell me of a reliable way to import buildings?  We're even open
to a front-end capture technology + intermediate translation tool.  This
doesn't necessarily have to be a &quot;one-step&quot; solution although that would be
super.

Very gratefully,

Chris
