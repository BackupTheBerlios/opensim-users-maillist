<PRE>What i found out so far: The message is written into the log when a
request exceeds a given threshold. Then a request is considered slow.
Close Encounter is a really nice region to do long time studies,
because the workload is almost the same over years now: Not much
building, Not much scripts but each friday evening a big party with up
to 25 avatars simultaneously on that sim. Here is a graph showing the
increase of slow GET CAPS:

As you can see we have a huge increase of slow requests since dcember.
Okie what is the reason for this increase as i mentioned the workload
is the same over 2 years. Upgrade to mono 2.10.6:

<A HREF="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7200/6855984237_62ab033d61_b_d.jpg">http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7200/6855984237_62ab033d61_b_d.jpg</A>

Possible... I installed the update on the 26. November 2011. Coud be,
but it's still no evidence.

During the party i did some samples and found out that some of the
caps producing slow GET requests were:

GetTexture
FetchInventoryDescendents2
FetchInventory2

Hmm FetchInventory2.... it immediately came to my mind that i did
change the OpenSim.ini to:

[ClientStack.LindenCaps]
    ;; For the long list of capabilities, see OpenSimDefaults.ini
    ;; Here are the few ones you may want to change. Possible values
    ;; are:
    ;;   &quot;&quot; -- empty, capability disabled
    ;;   &quot;localhost&quot; -- capability enabled and served by the simulator
    ;;   &quot;&lt;url&gt;&quot; -- capability enabled and served by some other server
    ;;
    ; These are enabled by default to localhost. Change if you see fit.
    Cap_GetTexture = &quot;localhost&quot;
    Cap_GetMesh = &quot;localhost&quot;
    ; This is disabled by default. Change if you see fit. Note that
    ; serving this cap from the simulators may lead to poor performace.
    Cap_FetchInventoryDescendents2 = &quot;localhost&quot;	
    Cap_FetchInventory2 = &quot;localhost&quot;

as suggested in one news post in osgrid.org. Reading the comment &quot;Note
that serving this cap .... poor performance&quot;. Well i made the upgrade
to the newest version only one week ago, but seen the increase of slow
GET requests since december 2011 then this change is most likely not
the root cause of this increase.

Other observations i made:

Mostly people using the Singularity viewer were affected by slow GET
... CAPS requests. The people using Imprudence had none to just a few
slow requests. But still those were just a few samples i took and
certainly not a serious research.

in order to correlate the data from the logs i'd need the following
information in the logs:

Authentication (or any other) procedure should log the Avatar Name
(ok), Avatar UUID (ok), Viewer Name (nok), IP (nok)
the IP address is used to correlate the slow GET Request with the Avatar.
Then during the registration of the capability with the http server
the Name and the UUID of the capability should be written into the log
(LogLevel INFO)

This would allow me to find out if there's a pattern like:

Slow CAPS (Name) &lt;-&gt; user,
Slow CAPS (Name) &lt;-&gt; viewer,

it is not important when the information is written to the log but it
is important THAT it will be written into the Log. Preferred Log Level
INFO, because i do not run this sim in DEBUG mode.

&gt;<i> There are a very large number of possible causes (busy simulator, poor
</I>&gt;<i> network links, many http requests) not helped by the fact that the debug
</I>&gt;<i> message doesn't say which cap is responsible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately, this means that I can't suggest any particular course of

</I>&gt;<i> In future, this information should be linked and spat out for diagnostic

</I>&gt;<i> the CAPS url with the information output by the &quot;region console&quot; command,
</I>&gt;<i> though this will generate a flood of info if there's any more than a single
