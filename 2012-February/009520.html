<PRE>Oh boy, I can use this.  The grid I have been working on, I am building 
everything, including Avatars I will offer using Real life scale.  I 
know in SL that confuses some people so I will explain.  I appear short 
to some in SL, because I use the scale shown in the building tool 
editor.  .5 meters is really .5 meters.

I am 5' 8&quot; in Real Life.  so my appearance editor is set for my AV 
height at 1.87 meters tall.  Short to giants in secondlife.  I choose 
this scale because it makes sense to me.  I can build a real life 
building to scale and have it look correct and like it does in real life 
without having to buy and pay tier on twice as much land as I would need 
to build it.

Anyway there is one drawback besides some people who don't understand 
how to use mouse look to see when inside a nice home that isn't built 
with cathedral ceilings.   Most homes are not.  One drawback is walking 
animations tend to be made for giant avatars.  I haven't taken 
measurements yet, but will.  This is using pure eye sight.  They seem 
correctly moving and taking steps at the default 1.3m step distance.  
When you make and AV with a real height in mind, a scaled down Avatar 
ends up taking a shorter stride and appears to slide forward.

The walk step becomes to short and slides to 1.3 ahead.  When an Avatar 
at my height should only be 0.75 the step.  With everyone in my grid 
being normal size, I can make adjustment using these setting to shorten 
the step difference.  I don't care if it appears slower.  It would look 
ridiculous seeing shorter humans looking like a tiny dog running next to 
a horse.


Thanks for the tip, and thanks for letting me rant.

</I>&gt;<i> Avatar speed is adjustable in the ODEPhysicsSettings section of your 
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim.ini configuration file. The relevant settings are:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ; speed of movement with Always Run off
</I>&gt;<i> av_movement_divisor_walk = 1.3
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ; speed of movement with Always Run on
</I>&gt;<i> av_movement_divisor_run = 0.8
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm afraid I don't know exactly how the values for these options work. 
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps someone else can clarify them, or you can experiment with them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can also increase the speed of individual avatars using the 
</I>&gt;<i> scripting function osSetSpeed. The wiki page describing this function 
</I>&gt;<i> can be found here: <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/OsSetSpeed">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/OsSetSpeed</A>
