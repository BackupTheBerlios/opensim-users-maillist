<PRE>Hi InuYasha,
I don't think it is a 'show stopper'. The avatar based VR applications
space is very wide, for e.g. some potentially powerful applications
(eg multiuser data visualizations, GIS applications, even games that
do not require physics are yet to emerge). From which ever angle you
look at it, philosophical, technical, design..sometimes physics might
not be the prime requirement. Having said that, a great physics engine
should be part of the platform ....for other obvious reasons to meet
requirements for the remaining class of applications, and I think many
people are already making progress in opensim domains too, am yet to
educate myself about it. It certainly would be nice for opensim to
lead an existence of its own and I think there is enough enthusiasm
out there for it to happen. On the 'feelings of dread' end about the
'future of opensim and so on', well that's how the mind functions ...
looks like there are going to be changes as always and the mind fears
change.  As I continue to use opensim, however, am finding that by and
large I feel happier, less trapped, less annoyed even if there are
things I miss once in a while which fortunately is not a prime
requirement for me in my current projects. On the technical end, there
are areas where opensim are superior to Second Life. For e.g. for
Linden Lab an NPC is still a pathfinding box.
Of course there is hypergrid and so on, as well (but most of my
clients require walled gardens so that is not too much useful for the
clients at the moment unless their efforts grow locally and might
recognize the need for this functionality)
I will wait for their implementation of Second Life's Havok ... in any
case, I hope the best for Linden Lab ... they are now governed by the
fear of survival. They will be playing defense for a long time to
come, I think, expect more barriers.
