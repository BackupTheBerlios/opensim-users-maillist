<PRE>(the following is not server-related, but as the question appeared in the discussion, I think some will appreciate the solution)

Just found by chance the fix for the 6 error messages of Imprudence on Mac: a couple of file names used for day cycles are url-encoded. Programs expect A-12PM.xml and doesn't find the existing A%2D12PM.xml file.

These files are located in 
	Imprudence 1.3.2.app/Contents/Resources/app_settings/windlight/skies
renaming (or, safer, copying) them with a dash instead of %2D makes the trick.

This can be done with Terminal or by displaying packet content. I'll answer more precise question by mail, if needed.

I searched that for a long time in the whole web and didn't find such a simple solution!

</I>&gt;<i> There are a lot of viewers out there. I am not overly interested in going to SL except to see what marvelous things people are creating so I don't plan on using the SL viewer very often.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On the mac  i use mainly Singularity even if the build is not in the most current state
</I>&gt;<i> Sometimes i use Impru as well on the mac even with the 6 error messages during startup. 
</I>&gt;<i> The most current 1.4 beta i don't use because music does not play
</I>&gt;<i> Phoenix and Firestorm... I don't like both. whenever i use them things get messy.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On Linux, the situation pretty much the same. Mainily Singularity, current version but does not play music
</I>&gt;<i> Impru 1.3.x or 1.4.x because they play music therefore i use them mostly on parties with DJ's or live concerts.
</I>&gt;<i> Phoenix and Firestorm... The same on Linux as on mac and i can't get used to the new Firestorm user interface. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have no idea what intentions are behind all those efforts of the different viewers. Improving usability? All those new/different menus and panels ( especially the preferences dialog ) it confuses more than it helps. Better rendering capabilities e.g. the kirsten viewer. Nice idea! but also there i hardly can get used to the ui.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Better Stability. Imprudence is very nice and Singularity is very nice on Linux as well. Those crashe mentioned in an other post I've mainly seen on mac.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore I mostly work under Linux right now, because i get the more current versions than on mac.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are certainly a lot of other viewers out there as well. But I need to be productive and get things done, therefore stability is most important.
</I>&gt;<i> Things have to materialize quickly and correctly, sharp and not blurry textures no cloud avatars. That's the second important feature.
</I>&gt;<i> The viewer should be nice to the sims as well. There are some issues especially with the newer viewers using http textures and the OpenSim. Thats the third important feature. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The newest and latest Features like Meshes are not so important for me they are quite new and I have no problems to wait until those features get more mature, because I am not building so much.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here's the viewer stats from the last 24 hours on all the Sims I maintain: <A HREF="https://plus.google.com/photos/109108978167407050970/albums/5721203138429046561?authkey=CNiV9-3LyMu7cQ">https://plus.google.com/photos/109108978167407050970/albums/5721203138429046561?authkey=CNiV9-3LyMu7cQ</A>
