<PRE>In the past this was beyond me.  I decided to try looking up the info 
once again, since the last time I tried this was two years ago.  The 
problem then was after all I did I found that the only instructions was 
to fit all the terrain I wanted as a 256x256 area which made it way to 
small and scaled in correctly.

I didn't want a fly over map, I was hoping for a 1:1 scale I could take 
walks on with my Avatar.  What I really want is a full scale 8 region 
across by 7 Region North-South set of terrain files that would cover the 
Island of Okinawa with Shuri in the direct center.  This is so I can at 
least try to build Shuri Castle to scale on the proper landscape.

I found the last time the data available was off scale because the data 
from Asia is with less resolution.  Two years later and all I seem to be 
finding is the same old one and two year sites.  I was thinking, can 
someone point me in the direction of the newest information, or if they 
know how to get this terrain I want, give me a clue.

Thanks so much for your time, both for reading this, and helping.
Long time fan of Opensim and its volunteers,
InuYasha.
