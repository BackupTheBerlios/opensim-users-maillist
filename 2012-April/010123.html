<PRE>While building and testing kokua viewer from the viewer-development code base I have stumbled&#160;
across a couple issues seemingly related to rendering body parts at log on. Please note that these
show up in a release with debug information (RelWithDebInfo) configuration so the llaserts&#160;
have not been stripped.

Taking most recent first, and in reference to a brief chat with JCC at last weeks kokua developers meeting,
there is a rendering&#160;anomaly which is best displayed by the following images:

Note: It is a male avatar without clothes:

These where found while determining the changeset that&#160;supposedly introduced the changed
behavior and it is not present when logged to Secondlife.

The quick solution was to backout the changeset and recompile. But, I think that is a band aid
that hides a opensim server problem.

Earlier I had experienced llassert actions in llface.cpp that where also related to exceeding a&#160;size maximum.
Again another band aid solution. &#160;Comment out the assert and recompile and all seemingly was OK.

So, thinking that maybe this is an edge case where the texture for body parts is 0-512 or 513 pixels instead
of 512 I decided to attempt to open the body part images located at&#160;C:\diva-r16915\bin\assets\Avatar\Newruth

using the JPEG2000 plugin with the GIMP. Gimp cannot decode the images even though the test jpeg2000
images delivered with the plugin opened fine.

I do not have photoshop.

Could someone with knowledge of the images in the server check their validity?

Concerning the most recent&#160;anomaly, I sent via email the information to the dev that authored the patch but, have not heard back.

Since was an&#160;attempt at more rigor in the viewer pipeline and since it doesn't affect Secondlife servers I don't see them moving
to resolve it. &#160;&#160;

Thoughts....
