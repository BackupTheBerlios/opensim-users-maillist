<PRE>Hi Gwyn,

I spent hours just a few weeks ago looking for exactly the same thing to no
avail.  Like you, I came across the mentions of OGRE and eventually even
found a copy of it, but with very little documentation and not enough time
to spend futzing with it, I didn't manage to get it working.

I'd also be extremely interested if anyone else has a solution, but I'm
guessing there might not be one.  If there is, my extensive google-fu
didn't turn anything else up.  :(

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After years of reading how to copy content between SL and OpenSim, as well
</I>&gt;<i> as doing all kinds of content backup in all possible formats, and reading
</I>&gt;<i> volumes of information on how to import sculpties and/or meshes developed
</I>&gt;<i> on application X (name whatever application you wish), I couldn't find
</I>&gt;<i> anything about exporting prim content from OpenSim (or Second Life, for
</I>&gt;<i> that matter) to a popular 3D format that could be used by any 3D modelling
</I>&gt;<i> tool.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is a reason for this. One of our projects (two OpenSim regions) was
</I>&gt;<i> seen as good background for a TV production. Now the producers need those
</I>&gt;<i> buildings in a standard 3D format to upload to their CGI software to do
</I>&gt;<i> special effects. Since all those objects (except for one or two sculpties)
</I>&gt;<i> only exist as OpenSim prims, how can I export them to, say, .OBJ, Collada,
</I>&gt;<i> .DXF, or any similar 3D format?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OAR/IAR are really just meaningful in the SL/OpenSim world. They're
</I>&gt;<i> completely meaningless for any other 3D software, because they're so
</I>&gt;<i> closely tied to the way SL/OpenSim store prim/mesh data.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I found a reference back in 2010, where some people had some limited
</I>&gt;<i> success using GLInterceptor with the OGLE plugin (the website for OGLE has
</I>&gt;<i> been down since mid-2010, but there are still ways to get copies of it).
</I>&gt;<i> The idea is the following: when the SL Viewer generates the mesh data for a
</I>&gt;<i> scene, it sends OpenGL commands, which get intercepted by GLInterceptor,
</I>&gt;<i> and are written on a file. OGLE apparently &quot;recombines&quot; those commands so
</I>&gt;<i> that they are mapped to object meshes, which can be saved to any popular
</I>&gt;<i> format. This allegedly works for simple objects, but I really have no idea
</I>&gt;<i> &#8212; because of the possibility of content theft, all information regarding
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;success&quot; with GLInterceptor/OGLE is really not much available.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Obviously the best solution would be an OAR/IAR-to-OBJ conversion tool,
</I>&gt;<i> but if such a tool exists, Google cannot find it :) I suppose it's
</I>&gt;<i> something worth developing one day, but it would take far, far too much
</I>&gt;<i> time. As said, the way objects are described in OAR/IAR make little sense
</I>&gt;<i> outside the SL/OpenSim context. Turning them into real mesh data, in
</I>&gt;<i> whatever popular format, is a highly complex operation &#8212; in effect, it
</I>&gt;<i> amounts to developing a 3D renderer from scratch that works on SL/OpenSim
</I>&gt;<i> data! As you all well know, almost every SL viewer out there uses the LL
</I>&gt;<i> rendering engine. Radegast is one exception. Does it save objects to .OBJ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So... I know that most of you are only worried about the reverse problem
</I>&gt;<i> (how to get your fantastic 3D models uploaded via mesh import into
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim), but I wonder if anyone actually had the need to do the reverse
</I>&gt;<i> operation &#8212; build in OpenSim, export to .OBJ &#8212; and, if so, what tools were
</I>&gt;<i> used to accomplish that feat?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It would be a pity to be forced to recreate everything from scratch :-(
</I>&gt;<i> Not to mention the time it takes...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks in advance for any input!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i>
