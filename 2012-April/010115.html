 &gt; I just noticed this article, and wanted to know what is really means to
 &gt; those of us who want to see opensim keep going and hope for newer
 &gt; updated and continued progress on new clients that support opensim.
 &gt;
 &gt; Cry Havok: New Linden Rules May Forbid 3rd Party Viewer
 &gt; Development for Use on Non-Lab Servers (i.e. OpenSim)
 &gt;
 &gt; 
<A HREF="http://nwn.blogs.com/nwn/2012/04/cry-havok-new-linden-guidelines-third-party-developers.html#comments">http://nwn.blogs.com/nwn/2012/04/cry-havok-new-linden-guidelines-third-party-developers.html#comments</A>
 &gt;
 &gt;
 &gt; Is this a show stopper??

No, it is not.

To be put in quite simple terms: this is an offer from Linden Lab to the 
community of Third Party Developers. If you as TPV developer do not want 
to implement the features necessary for the new path finding routines 
you do not need that kind of license and the vast majority of the 
residents is not going to use that kind of stuff even at all.

Again: it is a free offer from Linden Lab to the TPV developers, nothing 
more, nothing less.

Of course there is normally no such thing as a free lunch and my simple 
guess why they need to disallow the possibility of using that binary 
library on OS grids is that they need to pay a good amount of money as 
license fee ot Intel Inc., which owns Havok nowadays, and that that fee 
does not include the usage of that library in Opensim based grids, 
&quot;just&quot; only Linden Lab based grids, and frankly: what should Linden Lab 
care about that and even pay that for the competition?

Also if someone somewhere out of here wants to re-implement the 
necessary routines without Havok, well who is going to stop her/him?

And even if some viewer developers are going to use that license, what&#180;s 
the problem? Let&#180;s just say for example the kind bunch of people of the 
Firestorm project are going to sign that license. Even then it is not a 
showstopper, beceuse no one is going to stop them if they are going to 
produce and release two viewers from the same code base, one still named 
Firestorm which only connects to the Linden Grids then and another, 
let&#180;s call it Fireworm, for the rest of Opensim based grids without the 
Havok routines builtin.

The only problem in that license is not the license at all, but the 
somewhat clumsy coverage it got from Hypergrid Business, which is per so 
not a good news source at all in my opinion, because it&#180;s much more of a 
tabloid than a serious and well written newspaper.

Cheers,
Bart
