<PRE>I have to say that I agree with Sean and his reasoning.

Excellent summary, Sean.

I've seen lots of various makes in a very 'hands-on' profession which
required the laptops to be used by many people on lots of different
environments.

The Thinkpads did best.

So much so that when it came to buying our first new laptops, I bought my
wife and I an X200 each.

That's not to say other machines aren't good, just that the Thinkpads do
very well in multi-user environments.

Note: I avoid laptops generally as I find the 'use' argument usually more
of an 'excuse' argument. ie. Most people who have them don't really need
them and would be better served (money wise) with desktops.

Regards,
Patrick

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For workloads involving OpenSim and/or Second Life derived viewers,
</I>&gt;<i> you will definitely want a discrete graphics card in the laptop. This
</I>&gt;<i> increases cost, weight and size of the unit, as well as reduces
</I>&gt;<i> battery life, but it's well worth the downsides. Using integrated
</I>&gt;<i> graphics with a simulator is just unwise; the experience will be...
</I>&gt;<i> unpleasant. Maybe Ivy Bridge CPUs will change that, but don't count on
</I>&gt;<i> it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I personally have a very low opinion of the build quality of all
</I>&gt;<i> currently-available retail laptops except for two brands which really
</I>&gt;<i> stand out: the Panasonic Toughbook, and the Lenovo ThinkPad (notice:
</I>&gt;<i> *NOT* IdeaPad!).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Notice I said *build quality*. This says nothing about:
</I>&gt;<i> -Value/price
</I>&gt;<i> -Weight
</I>&gt;<i> -Battery life
</I>&gt;<i> -Performance
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What IS build quality? Build quality is a trait of a laptop which is
</I>&gt;<i> measured by judging how well the laptop withstands the pressures of
</I>&gt;<i> typical use and typical accidental damage / misuse. To me, build
</I>&gt;<i> quality goes far beyond the physical characteristics of the unit.
</I>&gt;<i> Build quality encompasses things such as:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -The reliability of the parts. Will your HDD last 2 years, or 8? This
</I>&gt;<i> is a build quality question.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -The robustness of the firmware and drivers for all of the parts. Will
</I>&gt;<i> your wifi card have a bug that randomly hangs the entire system when
</I>&gt;<i> it scans for new networks? Will your BIOS have a bug that refuses to
</I>&gt;<i> boot from USB flash drives? These little annoyances can add up to a
</I>&gt;<i> completely unusable product, if build quality is not a constant point
</I>&gt;<i> of attention by the manufacturer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -The ability of the hardware to survive in more extreme environments.
</I>&gt;<i> Is your laptop only going to survive if you keep the internals
</I>&gt;<i> completely clean of all dust and dirt, and keep it on a flat,
</I>&gt;<i> heat-conducting table at all times? Or will you be able to hold it at
</I>&gt;<i> odd angles against your knee (both a poor conductor and a small
</I>&gt;<i> surface area) for extended periods while running intensive
</I>&gt;<i> applications? Will the unit overheat if the temperature in your house
</I>&gt;<i> or lab is over 80 Fahrenheit? If you accidentally drop the unit, will
</I>&gt;<i> it shatter into a million pieces, or will it sustain a dignified scuff
</I>&gt;<i> mark on the case? All of these are build quality questions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -The degree to which your hardware was tested during development,
</I>&gt;<i> believe it or not, is a build quality question. The more well-tested a
</I>&gt;<i> device, the longer its time to market; but at the same time, the end
</I>&gt;<i> result will be far superior in reliability and will be able to support
</I>&gt;<i> more general use cases than products that are rushed to market only
</I>&gt;<i> expecting the top few most common use cases.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Personally, I think there is a tragic disease in the laptop and
</I>&gt;<i> embedded device market today, that build quality is being thrown out
</I>&gt;<i> the door, in favor of other factors, such as:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -Reducing cost
</I>&gt;<i> -Reducing time to market
</I>&gt;<i> -Reducing weight
</I>&gt;<i> -Reducing the labor-intensive parts of product development
</I>&gt;<i> -Increasing the &quot;raw stats&quot; (MHz, number of cores, amount of RAM, etc)
</I>&gt;<i> in the unit without increasing price
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This disease is as damaging to the overall satisfaction with a device
</I>&gt;<i> as it would be to eat a diet of pure sugar with no nutrients. Build
</I>&gt;<i> quality is the nutrients, fiber and protein of computing: it makes the
</I>&gt;<i> device *usable* in the same way that protein allows you to *survive*.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I won't disagree directly with Nebadon, but let's just say that I
</I>&gt;<i> definitely, positively would not recommend Toshiba as a laptop
</I>&gt;<i> manufacturer, especially with the target of a &quot;lab&quot; environment where
</I>&gt;<i> people who may not have your organization's best interests at heart
</I>&gt;<i> (or whom may not care about accidental or purposeful damage they might
</I>&gt;<i> attempt to inflict upon the units) will have regular access to the
</I>&gt;<i> PCs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is for these reasons that I encourage you to think carefully about
</I>&gt;<i> build quality, and not just cost and specifications, in your selection
</I>&gt;<i> of laptop; and I urge you to look at Lenovo ThinkPads and Panasonic
</I>&gt;<i> Toughbooks should you be interested in a unit with very rugged build
</I>&gt;<i> quality which I can proudly recommend from years and years of personal
</I>&gt;<i> experience.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Aside from that, chances are good that, getting down to specs, any
</I>&gt;<i> unit with &gt;= 4GB of RAM, &gt;= 200GB HDD, &gt;= 2 cores, a discrete (and
</I>&gt;<i> current-generation!) GPU, is going to be more than enough to enjoyably
</I>&gt;<i> run a workload such as OpenSim alongside a Second Life derived viewer.
</I>&gt;<i> For such a unit, you might look at the ThinkPad T-series laptops.
</I>&gt;<i> They're even fairly price competitive these days, if you omit frills
</I>&gt;<i> like fingerprint reader, bluetooth, and an SSD.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best of luck to you.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hey there,

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; period,  about 50% of the machines developed various issues from basic
