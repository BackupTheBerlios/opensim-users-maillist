<PRE>Hi all,

Since the FleepGrid hard drive crash a few weeks ago, I've been trying to
backup content in a variety of ways to make sure I never lose anything
again, but I keep running into issues making both OAR files and IAR files
with content that exists on the sim or in my inventory.  When the hard
drive failed and had to be replaced, I restored the opensim database from a
mysql dump file, and restored all of the regions with OAR backups.

It seemed to me that everything restored ok, but apparently that isn't the
case since I can't seem to make good new copies of some of the restored
items.

For example, I just tried to make an IAR backup of my &quot;product boxes&quot; -
these are items I've created and packaged up as freebies.  The boxes are
sitting on a region that I restored from an OAR file.  I go to the region,
take a copy of the boxes sitting out on the sim, and neatly organize them
by category in my inventory, then run the command to make an IAR file and I
see a ton of these error messages on the region console:

08:56:16 - [ASYNC REQUEST]: Request GET
<A HREF="http://74.83.148.18:8003/assets/5857ed38">http://74.83.148.18:8003/assets/5857ed38</A>

-c0f1-4e4c-ad2c-85ec41110fc2 failed with status ConnectFailure and message
Unabl
e to connect to the remote server

On the ROBUST console, at the same time, these errors pop up:

08:56:16 - [BASE HTTP SERVER]: slow GET request for
/assets/7474c82c-f428-4b76-b
2dd-10859beeb9d3 from 74.83.148.18:4431 took 3891 ms
08:56:16 - [BASE HTTP SERVER]: slow GET request for

08:56:16 - [BASE HTTP SERVER]: slow GET request for
/assets/6a137fba-7eec-4db8-8
038-e94250fbc8d3 from 74.83.148.18:3828 took 3906 ms

At the end of the IAR file save process, again on the region console, the
following appears:

08:56:17 - [ARCHIVER]: Added 1200 assets to archive
08:56:19 - [ARCHIVER]: Successfully added 1248 assets (1319 assets not
found but
 these may be expected invalid references)
08:56:19 - [INVENTORY ARCHIVER]: Saved archive for Fleep Tuque

Something similar happens when I try to make an OAR file backup of the sim
where these objects are rezzed, too, and I haven't yet tested with the IAR
file, but with the OAR file, the items will appear when the OAR is loaded,
but the object textures are missing from all the contents in the boxes.
 (i.e. a shirt object will be in the box, but the texture will be blank
white).

The funny thing is, as far as I can tell the original items restored from
the OAR backup are all ok.  I have cleared cache in Imprudence and can open
the boxes and pull out the same shirt and the texture seems fine, but I see
yet another error on the console that looks like this when I right click &gt;
open the item and try to copy the contents to my inventory:

09:24:17 - [PRIM INVENTORY]: Move of inventory item
00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000

a4d for Fleep Tuque

So two questions:

1) I don't think I have anything misconfigured (though it's certainly a
possibility!) so I'm not sure why the region console would be giving an
error that it can't connect to the remote server when trying to make the
IAR file, especially since all the processes run on the same server.

2)  I don't understand what's wrong with the restored items rezzed out on
the sim.  The box is there, the contents are there, the textures all appear
ok even after clearing cache, but I'm getting errors when trying to copy
them to my inventory, or saving out OAR or IAR files.  Any ideas what could
cause that or better yet how to fix it so I don't have to recreate
everything from scratch?

I can't bear the thought of starting over completely, but if I can't figure
out which items are .. broken for want of a better word, and which ones are
ok, then I'm not sure what to do.  I don't want to keep building and
developing on regions that I can't backup, or working with inventory items
that might be corrupt somehow.  I'm really not sure what to do.
