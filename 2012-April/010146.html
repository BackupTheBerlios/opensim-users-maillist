<PRE>I've had 3 different experience with three different viewers. The one
key experience is that full perm objects placed in a box or
&quot;primitive&quot; show up as no copy, no modify, and no transfer when
avatars other than the owner examine the contents. However, three
different viewers give three different related experiences. Listed
below is the symptoms for each viewer. --Rick


Scenario:
Version: OpenSim 0.7.3.1 Post_Fixes de667ea (interface version 7)

Create box
Place a t-shirt or another box in it with full permissions copy,
modify, transfer
Set box for &quot;buy&quot; for 0 dollars


3 viewers have different behaviors:
Imprudence 1.4.0 Beta 1 :
Another avatar right-click selects the &quot;box&quot; &quot;Buy&quot; and &quot;Open&quot; appear as options
Select &quot;buy&quot;
- Nothing happens
Select &quot;open&quot;
- All contents are listed, but with no copy, no modify, no transfer
Select copy to inventory
- Message: You have selected &quot;co copy&quot; inventory items. These items
will be moved to your inventory.
Select &quot;OK&quot;
- inventory pops up with all the items in correct folder
Right click on item in inventory select &quot;properties&quot;
- original full perms are shown for the objects
If instead you immediately &quot;edit&quot; an look in box, no contents are
there, If you wait 30 seconds contents reappear in the box.


Firestorm 4.0.1:
No &quot;open&quot; option appears, only &quot;Buy&quot;
Selecting &quot;Buy&quot; will fail
Edit, and examine contents
-no copy, no modify, and no transfer are displayed
Take Copy
-Everything appears correct, and with the correct permissions
Drag to Rez
-Everything appear good to you
-Other viewers when viewing contents show no copy, no modify, no transfer

Second LIfe 3.3.0 viewer
No &quot;open&quot; option appears, only &quot;Buy&quot;
-&quot;Buy&quot; succeeds object is in inventory with correct contents
Drag rez box
- Permissions for contents are full copy, modify, transfer
- &quot;Open&quot; is an option
Select &quot;open&quot;
Copy to inventory
- Everything works out fine

In all cases you can take a &quot;copy&quot; of the box


The permissions on the &quot;shirt&quot; remain no copy, no modify, no transfer
You take owner ship of the box, and then get the shirt out, and the
permissions are full perms  as well as the items
