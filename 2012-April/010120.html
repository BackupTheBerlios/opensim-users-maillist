<PRE>I think things depend on how the feature is integrated into the viewer and how the Havok sublicense clause

&#8220;Sublicensee must require the Third Party Viewer to connect only to servers owned or operated by the Company [Linden Lab].&#8221;

is interpreted.

If LL allow a TPV to develop both an LL-only Havok version and an OpenSim/other non-Havok version then I don't think 
it's too bad.  This requires that the new code be modular and not absolutely core to the viewer experience in some way. 
  At the moment I believe it only touches optional pathfinding but this could change over time.

If either of these conditions is false then I think TPV developers are forced to make a choice - use Havok and develop 
for LL only or abandon LL and develop only for OpenSimulator and similar platforms.

And to be honest, I'm not sure how the Havok sublicense could be enforced.  Once a Havok binary is out in the wild it 
doesn't matter who you whack - the code isn't going to disappear.  Anybody could glue a viewer together with the Havok 
binary and use it how they like, or publish a patchset which moves any LL-only restrictions from an existing open-source 
viewer.

Then again, Havok do have a free (Intel sponsored) physics download (albeit win32 only) which can even be used in 
commercial games with a value of 10 USD or less.  I hear that this doesn't contain pathfinding functionality (?) but 
this doesn't seem a million miles away from allowing a similar package to be used in open-source software
