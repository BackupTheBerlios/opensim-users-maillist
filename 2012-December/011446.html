<PRE>Hi Justin,

This started to happen just recently as soon as I started to use commit 
905d7c4 (r/21385); although I am not sure exactly when this may have 
started as I made a bit of a jump (895d28f r/20917 to 905d7c4 r/21385)

This appears to happen when there is more than one person logged in.

Did some tests in a few different variations of connectivity 
configurations (As far as which computer(s) the viewers are running on):

Have 2 Computers set up, 1 with OS and all related services running, the 
other does not have anything OS related running. Running a typical home 
network, 1 network, nothing fancy =)

Results:
1 viewer running on the non OS computer: No apparent issues
1 viewer running on the OS computer: No apparent issues

2 (or more) viewers running on the non OS computer: Shows the 
AgentUpdate packet warnings from time to time
2 (or more) viewers running on the OS computer: Shows the AgentUpdate 
packet warnings although it is noticeably a bit spammier in this 
configuration

1 viewer running on OS computer and 1 viewer running on non OS computer: 
Shows the AgentUpdate packet warnings although it is noticeably a bit 
spammier in this configuration. The viewer on the OS computer tends to 
experience network lag quite a bit when walking (i.e. The avatar drifts 
off into space for a few seconds after every few steps) while the viewer 
on the non OS computer will be able to walk around just fine but the 
warnings will still pop up in both cases.


If I set RecyclePackets = false in [PacketPool] then the issues seem to 
go away. I repeated the above tests and threw in a couple more viewer 
instances for good measure to check as well.



For the HTTP Inventory question; I set:

[ClientStack.LindenCaps]
     Cap_FetchInventoryDescendents2 = &quot;&quot;
     Cap_FetchInventory2 = &quot;&quot;

And inventory seems to load now (very quickly I might add) for viewers 
with HTTP Inventory disabled in Debug Settings.


I did run into an exception along the way in my testing right after I 
made the changes in [ClientStack.LindenCaps]. The below stack trace came 
up (One exception per script in the item) when I detached one of my 
attachments. I am not certain if it is related to any of the above but I 
do recall that you wanted some more information on script state related 
issues so I thought this might be a good thing to add =)

Thank you!

</I>&gt;<i> since they tell the server about agent movements, head rotation, etc, 
</I>&gt;<i> even when you're standing completely still.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So this must only be happening on rare occasions.  In the current code

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This seems very unlikely, so I think a stronger candidate is some 
</I>&gt;<i> packet pooling issue.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So in connection with this
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) How recently did this start happening?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Does it happen when you are alone on a region with nobody in the 
</I>&gt;<i> same or in any neighbouring regions?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) What happens if you set
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [PacketPool]
</I>&gt;<i> RecyclePackets = false
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also a quick question about HTTP inventory and more recent viewers 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (i.e. Firestorm, SL v3.3.x, and possibly v1.23 based
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> viewers that support it (have not tested these though)); It seems 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that when I have HTTP Inventory disabled my inventory
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> refuses to load up until HTTP Inventory is enabled. I prefer to keep 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it off because UDP inventory loads a lot quicker
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for me and having it disabled also seems to result in more stable 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> teleports on LL grid. Is there anyway to fix this in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the config files?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the server side, UDP inventory is always available.  You could 
</I>&gt;<i> disable HTTP inventory on the server side with the instructions at [1] 
</I>&gt;<i> just to be sure.  But I think a viewer bug is more likely where 
</I>&gt;<i> fallback is not happening properly when HTTP inventory is disabled.  I 
</I>&gt;<i> don't know if there are any viewer config values which would help in 
</I>&gt;<i> this situation.
