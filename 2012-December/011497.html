<PRE>Chris,

 

I have been trying different things. 

-          I tried your idea of logging in using the same computer as my grid is running on. First it did not work. 

-          So I tried changing my viewer. I have always had good luck running the HippoViewer. Changed over to Imprudence. Still did not work.

-          Tried resetting my grid back to just grid and restarting. Tried hypergrid again (knowing it would not work). I did, however, see a different response than &#8220;unable to verify identity&#8221;. This time is was &#8220;possible communication failure&#8221;. This is good I thought.

-          Reset my grid back to HyperGrid and tried it again and still did not work. Rechecked my HyperGate and reset all of its inner scripts. Tried another gate. Still not working, but same communications failure response. This is still a good favorable response.

-          Now I was getting curious. I tried more and more of the busy gates until &#8230; viola!!!! I found one that would work. I made it back into the HyperGrid!

-          My next project was to take myself from the robust computer and back onto my high speed system I&#8217;ve always used. This is simply another 192.168.x.xxx machine behind my firewall. That also worked.

-          FYI: the busy gate I could get into is: Burgenland

 

So now I have HyperGrid. Not what I wanted but I got it.

 

Now I am back to my original issues:

 

(1)    I want to know if anyone has successfully split regions across multiple computer systems? I know that multiple instances can be done (and Chris I may have to make contact with you on that). I need extremely specific details of how it was done.

(2)    Same as #1, above, except I need explicit directions of how to split Robust services across a network. If it can be done, I need the fine details of how.

(3)    We have a superb project with OpenSim and I like it very much. The cons: nearly everything that is past the basic setups are done in a Linux/Unbuntu system configuration. Some of us use Windows systems too. We need to begin writing our documents with this in mind.

 

I recommend to the group, if you write something down for future use, please specify what system you are running it under.

 

Randy

I forgot to add, if you're serious about running your own publicly accessible Opensim grid from home, I'm a big fan of registering an actual domain name and getting a static IP address from your ISP - that resolved nearly all the networking issues I ran into when I was first trying to set up FleepGrid. I never could get the dyndns and NAT loopback stuff working properly on my network.

 

Sincerely,

 

- Chris/Fleep
