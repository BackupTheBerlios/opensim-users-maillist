<PRE>Believe me, I sincerely appreciate the assistance I am receiving in solving
my dilemma. However, it appears as though some of you have misunderstood the
problems.

 

Chris I believe you are aware of what my intent is.

 

For others,

 

(1)    My presence on the internet and the loopback and access to the SQL
information are configured correctly.

(2)    I have had successful logins from an external access point.

(3)    I am able to login simultaneously with 5 avatars using multiple
viewer instances.

(4)    I am currently running one instance of Opensim on the same computer
system as the robust instance.

(5)    My intent was to setup OpenSim on a second separate computer and also
move Robust services (or a portion) to a third system.

(6)    All of this is occurring on a home computer behind a firewall. I have
successfully setup DYNDNS to provide internet presence. This can be verified
by going to &quot;gcse.dyndns.org&quot; should you feel the need.

 

These are where my questions began.

 

If I have misunderstood your posts, I apologize. Again, I appreciate the
attempts to help in this issue. Please read all of the information in the
thread before attempting to help. Some of this is basic information that has
already been setup (as clearly indicated in the thread).

 

Thank you and please continue to provide guidance after reading what is
here.
