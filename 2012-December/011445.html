AgentUpdates are extremely common messages.  If you do &quot;debug packet 255&quot; on the console you will see a constant stream 
of them come in since they tell the server about agent movements, head rotation, etc, even when you're standing 
completely still.

So this must only be happening on rare occasions.  In the current code this should only happen if an agent update 
message has somehow been sent to the client port from another source but with wrong session and agent IDs.

This seems very unlikely, so I think a stronger candidate is some packet pooling issue.

So in connection with this

1) How recently did this start happening?

2) Does it happen when you are alone on a region with nobody in the same or in any neighbouring regions?

3) What happens if you set

[PacketPool]
RecyclePackets = false

?

</I>
On the server side, UDP inventory is always available.  You could disable HTTP inventory on the server side with the 
instructions at [1] just to be sure.  But I think a viewer bug is more likely where fallback is not happening properly 
when HTTP inventory is disabled.  I don't know if there are any viewer config values which would help in this situation.
