<PRE>Wow, OMG, I have my own personal grid, with ten friends testing it,  as 
users.   I have bnen working on, and building every thing on it mostly 
myself.  It is starting to feel it will take the rest of my life to 
gleam anything I will be proud to let others come enjoy.  I have used 
3dsmax since back in version 2, with so much more to go, I don't know if 
I can take that much time away from building, scripting, sound creating, 
and so on to learn to do all this.  I guess I will have to use the old 
way of making walking roaming animals on Opensim.  Trying to animate 
sculpted extremities and get it to look right somehow.  It seems it 
might take months away from getting any further on my dreams of a nice 
Early 17th Century Ryukyu Kingdom grid.

Thanks very much for the information, it explained a lot.

</I>&gt;<i> When it comes to rigged meshes, you can go two ways. Both paths start 
</I>&gt;<i> at Gaia Clary's Machinimatrix website. The simplest thing to do is to 
</I>&gt;<i> purchase and use their Avastar product (US$22) which does a lot of 
</I>&gt;<i> things for you, and supports things like LL's internal animation 
</I>&gt;<i> format. I've never used this product, so I really don't know anything 
</I>&gt;<i> about it in depth.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The other way has a steeper learning curve, because you have to do 
</I>&gt;<i> everything yourself, and starts with a Blender project file called 
</I>&gt;<i> avatar-workbench. This file contains the default LL skeletal rig, a 
</I>&gt;<i> weighted avatar mesh, and a MakeHuman mesh weighted to the LL rig. 
</I>&gt;<i> This is definitely the more challenging path, as you need to learn how 
</I>&gt;<i> to setup and configure many things yourself. I find this more 
</I>&gt;<i> satisfying myself, as I'm forced to learn exactly what's going on and 
</I>&gt;<i> generally why things occasionally go awry, but most people just wanna 
</I>&gt;<i> get stuff done. Avastar also has the only Blender exporter for LL's 
</I>&gt;<i> internal animation format that I've ever heard of. It's shame there's 
</I>&gt;<i> no open sourced one around yet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You find both the Avastar product and the free avatar-workbench 
</I>&gt;<i> project file at the following URL: <A HREF="http://blog.machinimatrix.org/">http://blog.machinimatrix.org/</A>
