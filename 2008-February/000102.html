<PRE>Hi all,

I am currently running 0.5 in local grid mode, with MySQL as a database. 
I wonder if there's a web interface to add users to the database? That 
would allow for easy registration. I think I saw something like that 
once, but am not sure. Anyone know such a tool? Experiences?

After I upgraded to 0.5, I was able to reload the prims I saved from the 
0.4.x install. The prims correctly positioned themselves at an altitude 
of 21 meters. But for some reason, all avatars are knee deep into the 
terrain, or walking with crooked legs, as they seem to think they have 
to walk at 20 meters altitude. Is that something I have to configure 
somewhere?

Finally, I currently run one island on one region. Not *that* big. There 
are some instructions at the opensim website on how to work with 
regions, but there's not really a coherent manual (or even a shortlist 
of instructions) that I am aware of that explain how to work with more 
than one region. Is anyone aware of something like that?

I am happy with the way Opensim is developing, btw. Kudos to all involved!

Cheers,
Sered
