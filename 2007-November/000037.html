<PRE>How about this  ... ( keep in mind that I'm not a coder )

What if you were to create a script within SL-Linden grid that would analize
the component parts of an object , prim by prim. Scanning it if you will.
Every object is based on prims, and those prims have fixed parameters. In
the simplest example , an axle with two wheels is composed of a circular
prim, size X,Y,Z attached to another prim of size x,y,z, length, and another
circular prim of the size x,y,z. So now you ahve teh raw data to recreate
the object. You could scan an existing object, record the parameters of teh
prims that make it up, and then output that in a text or xml format to a
notecard that you could copy/paste/send to yourself and have delivered to
your email.

On the other end , in OpenSL  you could have a companion script that reads
this in and recreates the series of prims exactly as they were created in
the Linden grid. Granted textures and such might have to be done
differently, but I'm not sure what the limits in LSL are.

It's an idea, yes?

start eating breakfast, take up jogging.&quot;
