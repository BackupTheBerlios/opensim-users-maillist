<PRE>Hi Dahlia,

I don't believe I am low on system memory... It has 11 gigs in it and 
only using ~37% of it overall even after running my viewer and OpenSim 
for a while and not much else running aside from that except the 
occasional browser window and maybe Winamp; although I do experience the 
lockups with nothing else running except OpenSim and a single viewer. 
OpenSim's memory use has always been ~500 - 600 MB give or take a few of 
course.

My video card should be more than capable; but I don't usually have the 
settings ramped up to the highest for everyday use.

Average CPU use is about ~30% - 40% most of the time; much of it being 
my viewer. I have tried setting CPU affinity to processor 3 for the 
viewer so that OpenSim has the other 3 cores to do stuff with but to not 
much avail.

The system was last rebooted about 3 hours ago as of this writing where 
I have continued using OpenSim and experienced the lock ups since then.

Windows was recently reinstalled fresh on the system to rule out 
possibility of malware, corruption, or something else screwy going on there.

I gathered together a few bits of system info that might be helpful 
(While OpenSim and a viewer has been running for a while):

OpenSim memory use as reported by show stats command:

MEMORY STATISTICS
Allocated to OpenSim objects: 306 MB
OpenSim last object memory churn    : 0.559 MB/s
OpenSim average object memory churn : 1.051 MB/s
Process memory              : 599 MB

Memory use as reported by Windows Task Manager:
Total: 11263
Cached: 4553
Available: 7029
Free: 2728

and my system setup:
OpenSim: 10 Region Standalone on 0.7.6 Dev
Physics: Open Dynamics Engine
OS: Windows 7 (x64)
CPU: AMD Phenom II X4 840 3.2 GHz
Video: GeForce GTX 560 Ti (1 GB)
Memory: 11 GB DDR3
Database: MySQL 5.1.63 (x64)

At one point in OpenSim's development not too long ago (I don't remember 
exactly when, probably sometime before mid to late 0.7.5's development) 
this was never an issue; I never saw any lockups. Nothing has changed on 
my system hardware wise and very minimal change has been done on my 
regions since then except for the fact that I try to keep my server up 
to date with the latest development code when possible. I do understand 
the risks of this and I'm perfectly happy to be a tester for it :) I 
suppose my question now though is... Why would it be happening in the 
more recent code?

I'm by no means an expert when it comes to memory use which is why I'm 
asking a ton of questions and trying to provide as much info as I can 
think of :) My apologies if I'm asking too many.

Many thanks for the help and suggestions so far!
