<PRE>Dahlia, I just caught the diagnostics a moment ago and the HDD light 
does come on and stay almost solid on for a good minute or so and then 
starts to fall off to random momentary flashes every once in a while 
(roundabouts the time I am able to regain control of my system again).

</I>&gt;<i> and only when the automated diagnostics starts to output its 
</I>&gt;<i> information to the console. This started back sometime midway through 
</I>&gt;<i> development of 0.7.5 (if I remember correctly) and then it went away 
</I>&gt;<i> for for a little while after some commits after it, then reappeared 
</I>&gt;<i> again. So I'm not exactly sure when it first started. I would think 
</I>&gt;<i> that git bisect would take a good while to do to track it down since I 
</I>&gt;<i> would have to wait an hour per test for diagnostics to show up... the 
</I>&gt;<i> show stats command doesn't seem to invoke this behavior.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Hello all,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I was wondering if it is possible to configure how often the 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> automated simulator diagnostics is ran, and if so, where at?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> It seems like every hour when the diagnostics is ran it results in 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> hanging my entire system up for about 30 - 45 seconds
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> which results in a variety of interesting things such as the viewer 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> hanging up entirely for that duration, music stops
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> playing if listening to music via external media player, other 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> programs hang up, etc. It also tends to translate to lag
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> for other people connected to my setup for about that long as well.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I know the ideal situation would be to run OpenSim on a system 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> dedicated to that; but right now I have no choice but to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> run it on the system that I do all my other daily things on. So I 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> would like to configure diagnostics to run every
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> say...  8 hours or so? It would make the system hangs a bit more 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> bearable :)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If it's not configurable externally I'm willing to stick my head 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> into the source code and change it manually there if
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> need be; if I could be pointed to the file and location in the code 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to change it... It's just driving me insane lol.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks!
