<PRE>Hi Justin,
I commented out the lines in BaseOpenSimServer.cs, compiled, and then 
proceeded to work on some things in world for a few hours. I noticed 
that while the diagnostic messages no longer appear; the hang ups still 
occur... but oddly not quite as bad as when the lines aren't commented 
out. Instead of hanging my system up for a solid minute almost; it hangs 
it up in short bursts a few times every few seconds appx. every hour or 
so. It is a little worse when the maps are generating; the system hangs 
for a bit longer each &quot;burst&quot;.

As far as an issue with writing to the console, I am uncertain, how can 
I find this out?
I don't have any logging settings aside from default except for setting 
logging for OpenSim.Region.ScriptEngine.XEngine to DEBUG in 
OpenSim.exe.config

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I was wondering if it is possible to configure how often the

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> programs hang up, etc. It also tends to translate to lag
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> for other people connected to my setup for about that long as well.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I know the ideal situation would be to run OpenSim on a system 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> dedicated to that; but right now I have no choice but to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> run it on the system that I do all my other daily things on. So I 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> would like to configure diagnostics to run every
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> say...  8 hours or so? It would make the system hangs a bit more 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> bearable :)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If it's not configurable externally I'm willing to stick my head 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> into the source code and change it manually there if
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> need be; if I could be pointed to the file and location in the code 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to change it... It's just driving me insane lol.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks!
