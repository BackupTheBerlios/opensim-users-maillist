<PRE>@Justin: I have checked for CPU use on OpenSim and its generally around 
~5% - 10% or so when it happens. I am using the standard Windows Task 
Manager though. I will see about tracking down some logging software to 
maybe give me some more in depth reading on it.

@Dahlia: The system can lock the system up without having any 3D 
applications running. It can be just OpenSim, my browser, or something 
else and it does it. But it's always when OpenSim is running.

@R.Gunther: Am using Windows 7 x64, but I'm fairly certain I'm using the 
correct SATA driver as I got it directly from the manufacturer's website 
specific to my motherboard.

@M.E. Verhagen: I understand that OpenSim won't necessarily have access 
to my full amount of ram especially considering that I'm using 
OpenSim.32BitLaunch.exe which if I remember correctly can only access 2 
GB max... but starts to run into out of memory errors sooner than that; 
but I am using it right now because OpenSim.exe tends to crash when 
compiling scripts under x64. I've not seen any out of memory errors in 
the console in a long time though. What would you suggest for minimizing 
disk caching, aside from possibly moving my swap file to another drive? 
I'm also using an older version of MySQL currently mostly because I 
absolutely hate the updated GUI tools system for MySQL 5.5 and above and 
even though I'm capable of it, I'd rather not use the MySQL console if I 
don't have to.

@StormSinger: I've cleared my temp files and ran CCleaner about a week 
ago; but no change before or after in lockups. As for antivirus I'm 
running Avast, with no scheduled scans that I can see. I tend to run it 
on demand when I need to. I also tried running OpenSim with AV 
completely disabled to no avail though. The lockups on the hour are 
relative to OpenSim's timed diagnostic output / map generation rather 
than on the system clock's hour. If by the &quot;other&quot; OpenSim exe you mean 
OpenSim.32BitLaunch.exe then yes, I always run that one instead of 
OpenSim.exe. From what I understand OpenSim.exe will run native 64 bit 
on x64 Windows and OpenSim.32BitLaunch.exe runs 32 bit but at the 
expense of limited memory access. I may be mistaken so anyone please 
feel free to correct me on this :) As far as drivers I got them directly 
from all my hardware's respective manufacturer websites for their make 
and model. Did Windows Updates, .NET updates, etc. The whole nine yards :)

M.E., I did take a sort of an approach on your suggestion of minimizing 
disk caching and was hit with the idea to move my OpenSim install to 
another hard drive separate from where Windows and MySQL resides. Sorta 
dramatic I suppose, but so far as I can tell, the system freezing seem 
to be gone now that I've done that. I've only managed to catch it in 
diagnostics (i.e. actively using OpenSim and my viewer) twice since then 
with no apparent system freeze; but going on past experience where each 
freeze I've noticed coincided with either diagnostic output and/or map 
generation, I believe I can say it is quite a bit better if not 
completely gone now.

It is still strange though that this is only a fairly recent (within the 
past few months) development for me in that the freezes never used to 
happen with no change in my system setup, MySQL setup, or the location 
of OpenSim.

Long story short; I believe that I've resolved or at least avoided the 
system freezes by relocating my OpenSim install to a different physical 
disk away from Windows and MySQL's location.

Thank you everyone for your replies and extremely helpful advice. I 
greatly appreciate it :)
