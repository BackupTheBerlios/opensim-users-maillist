<PRE>Melanie, (and others of course)

I would very much like to see (and be willing to pay a license fee for) a viewer that had little more capacity than to render (out to a kilometer), support navigation (including hypergridded TP), and have robust login security (I don't know, maybe 128-bit).  Does such a &quot;viewer&quot;/renderer exist?

V/r,

Chris

PS If the viewer I just described could run in a &quot;browser&quot; that too would be even more terrific!

  Thanks Melanie, this motivate me for trying it out. For my user training strategy, I try to stick to only one viewer ... so I will check it out and consider whether I need to shift from Firestorm.

    Singularity combines the tried and proven, efficient user interface
    of the v1 viewer series with the advanced rendering features of the
    v3 series of viewers.

    The v3 interface was simplified (some say &quot;dumbed down&quot;) to
    accommodate a new class of users who are not necessarily creators.
    Also, it was enhanced (some say cluttered) with a lot of web site
    links to various parts of the LL site. TPV policy mandates that the
    SecondLife web integration features may not be removed from any TPV
    that wishes to connect to SecondLife. Of course, this only affects
    the v3 UI. Some consider the links and buttons that lead to places
    like showcase or marketplace little more than marketing spam while
    others value them as convenient shortcuts to places they visit often.

    Viewers need to be as diverse as the people who use them, no one
    size fits all. Singularity's interface is aimed at people who just
    want to get the job done. Lacking all the fancy doo-dads, bells and
    whistles, it offers a functional, streamlined power user UI.

    If you like Firestorm, Singularity may not be for you. It's
    different. I have, for instance, spoken to people who can't handle
    chat with the &quot;Name: Text&quot; format, but instead need the highlighted
    name on a line by itself. v3 style, to be able to keep track.

    Singularity doesn't waste an inch of screen space, it's UI is very
    compact to allow you the maximum world window while still keeping
    chats and build tools in view.

    I prefer that.

    Melanie
