<PRE>Hello there,
I was hoping to get some ideas here. I ve been experimenting for a while
with picking up NPCs and driving them in ambulances or police vehicles
etc.. and driving them to some targets. When things work, it is a really
enjoyable activity (well within the situation context that am not
describing here to keep things simple). However, I have noticed that when I
leave the vehicle after I ask the NPCs to get off, I lose keyboard control
of my avatar rotation even thought I made sure that llReleaseControls are
fired up when I get up. The only way for me to get my avatar unstuck
(actually forward and back work,but rot left and right do not) is to use a
function I never knew existed in Firestorm (in the advanced menu, there is
a submenu 'release keys'. The other way to retain my avatar control is for
me to get off the vehicle before the NPCs. So the order here seems
important.
Question I have is this,
why is it that llReleaseControl seems to be successful only for forward and
back?
And if there is a force release function, is there some way to do this in
script ( I don't think there is).
R
p.s. I have not heard about the new vehicle physics for a while, anything
on that front?
