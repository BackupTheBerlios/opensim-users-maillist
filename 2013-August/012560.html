<PRE>Thanks Dahlia and RG... I think you are seeing the same issue I had 
as the problem of the HUD object stuck in the middle of the screen 
did follow a HG trip where the first TP back to the home grid failed 
and then a second worked.

I did not know we had a &quot;clear up&quot; mechanism for &quot;attachment&quot; type 
objects stuck at 0,0,0 now to help fix this, and will try that in 
future if it reoccurs.  But I am not sure it can be working as when I 
looked round I found some other objects in the same areas.

Singularity does not render these objects

Firestorm 4.4.2 renders them but of you try to edit them to move or 
change their properties it immediately crashed

Kirsten's S19 latest version viewer updated  recently lets you edit 
them and change a few properties such as the ruler 
attachment/local/reference (indicating it was of type attachment 
rather than a normal in world object) and the 
temporary/locked/physical flags.  I changed them to ruler local 
objects but could not move them.  But I was able to change their type 
to temporary and that made them go away.

Thanks, Ai

</PRE>
