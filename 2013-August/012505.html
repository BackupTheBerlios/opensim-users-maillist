<PRE>For that matter, since we're talking about system maintenance, remember
that the windows operating system actually has to be manually defragmented
using Disk Defragmenter (Disk Optimizer in 8) or a third party software
like piriform's Defragmenter. While you're at it, I'd clean out your temp
files and fix any registry errors using piriform's CCleaner. Or whatever
tool you wanna use. Also, what anti virus are you using? Is it perhaps
running a mini-scan on the hour? And, since you mentioned reinstalling
windoze, do you have all the correct drivers for your box?

I'm assuming those memory values are the ones reported at the time if the
lockup, but isn't there some diagnostic software you can run that will
actually log (and perhaps graph) the memory usage of windows? Actually, how
are you getting the data? Is that a reliable source, I mean, is it actually
reading the background data usage of windows as windoze checks for updates
and does it's own, memory-intensive thing?

This is just a part of the general checklist I go through every time I
troubleshoot something on windows. I mean, if it's a ghost problem like
this.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Hi Dahlia,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I don't believe I am low on system memory... It has 11 gigs in it and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> only using ~37% of it overall even after running my viewer and OpenSim for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a while and not much else running aside from that except the occasional
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> browser window and maybe Winamp; although I do experience the lockups with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nothing else running except OpenSim and a single viewer. OpenSim's memory
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> use has always been ~500 - 600 MB give or take a few of course.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My video card should be more than capable; but I don't usually have the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> settings ramped up to the highest for everyday use.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Average CPU use is about ~30% - 40% most of the time; much of it being my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> viewer. I have tried setting CPU affinity to processor 3 for the viewer so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that OpenSim has the other 3 cores to do stuff with but to not much avail.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The system was last rebooted about 3 hours ago as of this writing where I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have continued using OpenSim and experienced the lock ups since then.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Windows was recently reinstalled fresh on the system to rule out
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> possibility of malware, corruption, or something else screwy going on there.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I gathered together a few bits of system info that might be helpful
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (While OpenSim and a viewer has been running for a while):
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OpenSim memory use as reported by show stats command:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> MEMORY STATISTICS
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Allocated to OpenSim objects: 306 MB
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OpenSim last object memory churn    : 0.559 MB/s
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OpenSim average object memory churn : 1.051 MB/s
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Process memory              : 599 MB
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Memory use as reported by Windows Task Manager:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Total: 11263
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Cached: 4553
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Available: 7029
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Free: 2728
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and my system setup:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OpenSim: 10 Region Standalone on 0.7.6 Dev
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Physics: Open Dynamics Engine
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OS: Windows 7 (x64)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> CPU: AMD Phenom II X4 840 3.2 GHz
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Video: GeForce GTX 560 Ti (1 GB)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Memory: 11 GB DDR3
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Database: MySQL 5.1.63 (x64)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> At one point in OpenSim's development not too long ago (I don't remember
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exactly when, probably sometime before mid to late 0.7.5's development)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this was never an issue; I never saw any lockups. Nothing has changed on my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> system hardware wise and very minimal change has been done on my regions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> since then except for the fact that I try to keep my server up to date with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the latest development code when possible. I do understand the risks of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this and I'm perfectly happy to be a tester for it :) I suppose my question
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> now though is... Why would it be happening in the more recent code?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm by no means an expert when it comes to memory use which is why I'm
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> asking a ton of questions and trying to provide as much info as I can think
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of :) My apologies if I'm asking too many.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Many thanks for the help and suggestions so far!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
