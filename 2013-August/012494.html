<PRE>Hi Justin, I have observed this on several different systems with 
different databases and varying amounts of scripted objects and regions 
(ranging from very few to fairly populated). I see very little CPU use 
for OpenSim when this is happening but yet the systems hang up entirely 
for a while as it's doing it (appx 30 seconds to 1 minute) and only when 
the automated diagnostics starts to output its information to the 
console. This started back sometime midway through development of 0.7.5 
(if I remember correctly) and then it went away for for a little while 
after some commits after it, then reappeared again. So I'm not exactly 
sure when it first started. I would think that git bisect would take a 
good while to do to track it down since I would have to wait an hour per 
test for diagnostics to show up... the show stats command doesn't seem 
to invoke this behavior.

Hi Dahlia, I hadn't thought to check my HDD light as it was happening 
(due to my desk layout it's a bit difficult to see the light from where 
I sit; so I had never just casually glanced over to look.) I will keep 
an eye out for the HDD light when it does it again though.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If it's not configurable externally I'm willing to stick my head into

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to change it... It's just driving me insane lol.
