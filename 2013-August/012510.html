<PRE>Hi folks,

I wanted to give a quick update on the OpenSimulator Community Conference
2013 since we're now less than a month away!

Many of you involved with the community have put in proposals to be
speakers, and hopefully you've received a confirmation email with the
scheduled date, time, and location for your presentation.  If you put in a
proposal and didn't yet receive a confirmation, don't panic!  There are a
handful of folks that we're still trying to sort on the schedule due to
various time constraints, so we still have a few confirmations pending.
 You should get something soon, I promise.  ;)

I'd also like to thank everyone who has signed up as a sponsor!  A friendly
reminder that the deadline for all sponsor artwork and builds is 8/15, so
if you haven't gotten started yet, now's the time to do it.  Submit your
logo artwork at
<A HREF="http://conference.opensimulator.org/2013/sponsors/sponsor-artwork-submission/">http://conference.opensimulator.org/2013/sponsors/sponsor-artwork-submission/</A>
and
be sure to review the Expo Booth Building Guidelines at:
<A HREF="http://conference.opensimulator.org/2013/sponsors/sponsor-expo-booth-guidelines/">http://conference.opensimulator.org/2013/sponsors/sponsor-expo-booth-guidelines/</A>

This is also the last chance for anyone who wants to be a founding sponsor
of the conference to sign up, so if you're on the fence, please do take a
look at our Call for Sponsors page.  The community sponsorships are as low
as $50, and all proceeds go towards the cost of the conference grid and web
services needed to run the event.  We're still short on our estimated
budget, so every bit helps and the sponsorships are tax deductible for US
residents and companies, too!
<A HREF="http://conference.opensimulator.org/2013/sponsors/call-for-sponsors/">http://conference.opensimulator.org/2013/sponsors/call-for-sponsors/</A>

We also desperately need more volunteers for the Greeter, Moderator, and
Streaming teams.  Our goal is to stream and archive every session of the
conference, but if we don't have enough people to help do that, we'll be
forced to pick and choose which sessions to stream.  As a bonus, volunteers
get an in-world ticket to the conference, so you can hang out and enjoy the
rest of the event after your volunteer shift is over!  Please do sign up to
help volunteer if you can, we really appreciate the help:
<A HREF="http://conference.opensimulator.org/2013/staff/volunteer-application/">http://conference.opensimulator.org/2013/staff/volunteer-application/</A>

Last but not least, the Social Events schedule is starting to get sign-ups,
but there's plenty of slots still open.  This is a great way for you to
showcase your grid or projects if you don't feel like doing a formal
presentation.  Just sign up to host a social event on your own grid and
after the day's breakout sessions are over, conference attendees can come
visit and check out your space!  Sign up to host a social event at:
<A HREF="http://conference.opensimulator.org/2013/socials/social-event-sign-up/">http://conference.opensimulator.org/2013/socials/social-event-sign-up/</A>


Our many, many thanks to all of you who are already helping with the
conference, whether you're load testing, bug fixing, building, speaking,
sponsoring, or helping in some other way, this is shaping up to be an
awesome event!

Thanks and more to come soon as we start finalizing the schedule..

Sincerely,

- Chris/Fleep
