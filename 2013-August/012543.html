<PRE>Singularity combines the tried and proven, efficient user interface
of the v1 viewer series with the advanced rendering features of the
v3 series of viewers.

The v3 interface was simplified (some say &quot;dumbed down&quot;) to
accommodate a new class of users who are not necessarily creators.
Also, it was enhanced (some say cluttered) with a lot of web site
links to various parts of the LL site. TPV policy mandates that the
SecondLife web integration features may not be removed from any TPV
that wishes to connect to SecondLife. Of course, this only affects
the v3 UI. Some consider the links and buttons that lead to places
like showcase or marketplace little more than marketing spam while
others value them as convenient shortcuts to places they visit often.

Viewers need to be as diverse as the people who use them, no one
size fits all. Singularity's interface is aimed at people who just
want to get the job done. Lacking all the fancy doo-dads, bells and
whistles, it offers a functional, streamlined power user UI.

If you like Firestorm, Singularity may not be for you. It's
different. I have, for instance, spoken to people who can't handle
chat with the &quot;Name: Text&quot; format, but instead need the highlighted
name on a line by itself. v3 style, to be able to keep track.

Singularity doesn't waste an inch of screen space, it's UI is very
compact to allow you the maximum world window while still keeping
chats and build tools in view.

I prefer that.
