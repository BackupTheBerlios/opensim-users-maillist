<PRE>One other note I wanted to add to this thread, my own personal preference
prior to working with the conference was Imprudence/Kokua.  Particularly
Imprudence because it is such a stable workhorse!  So when the planning
team started talking about other viewers, I told them they'd pry Imp out of
my cold dead avatar hands.  ;)

Fortunately, I discovered that Singularity is as stable for me crash-wise
as Imprudence was, even on my older laptop, and as much as I &lt;3 Imprudence
(and I still do!), I've also had to come to terms with the fact that
without Mesh and MOAP support, Imprudence is pretty limited in viewing all
of the great new mesh and media content people are creating.

So I just wanted to say on a personal note, I definitely understand how
strong our attachment can become to the tools we use, because I felt the
same way.  However, Imprudence just won't work for the conference since our
presenters will be using MOAP and many components in the conference builds
use mesh for greater detail and rendering efficiency.  So if there are any
other Imprudence hold-outs out there, I'd encourage you to give the OSCC
Viewer a try.

&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regarding a &quot;recommended&quot; viewer for the OpenSimulator Community
</I>&gt;<i> Conference, we are certainly not saying that other viewers aren't great to
</I>&gt;<i> use - many of them are!  And we will have a panel of viewer developers in
</I>&gt;<i> the Developers &amp; Opensource track as part of the conference program,
</I>&gt;<i> including Firestorm and Kokua, so we'd encourage you to attend that session
</I>&gt;<i> to learn more about the various options available.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, we have many newbies and people who don't have much experience
</I>&gt;<i> with OpenSimulator or third party viewers in general planning to attend the
</I>&gt;<i> event, so we needed to pick one viewer to document instructions and
</I>&gt;<i> settings in order to make the event as accessible as possible to people who
</I>&gt;<i> aren't &quot;power users&quot;.  We also wanted to make sure our (tirelessly
</I>&gt;<i> hardworking) volunteer team could focus on supporting one known viewer
</I>&gt;<i> rather than trying to learn all the ins and outs of many viewers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Singularity was chosen because it supports Mesh and MOAP, and because the
</I>&gt;<i> viewer interface is relatively uncluttered.  It may be a judgement call,
</I>&gt;<i> but the conference planning team reviewed all of the viewers that support
</I>&gt;<i> Mesh and MOAP, tested them for performance, and we made a choice based on
</I>&gt;<i> what we felt would offer the best, least confusing option to the least
</I>&gt;<i> experienced user.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm sure you can appreciate that it just simply wouldn't be feasible for
</I>&gt;<i> us to try to support every viewer out there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We know that many experienced OpenSimulator users have their own preferred
</I>&gt;<i> viewer - and that's fine!  We're providing basic instructions and
</I>&gt;<i> connection details for other viewers as well, so anyone who feels
</I>&gt;<i> comfortable using a different viewer can do so, but we expect those folks
</I>&gt;<i> to need a lot less hand holding in general.  So long as the viewer supports
</I>&gt;<i> Mesh and MOAP, it should work great for the conference, and we encourage
</I>&gt;<i> experienced users to use whatever viewer they are most comfortable with -
</I>&gt;<i> it's just that we can only offer support for the one viewer we've tested,
</I>&gt;<i> documented, and that our volunteer team has trained on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think it's a strength of the OpenSimulator ecosystem that we have so
</I>&gt;<i> many viewers to choose from, and though we've chosen one viewer to
</I>&gt;<i> recommend for the conference, that is not meant to imply in any way that
</I>&gt;<i> other viewers aren't also good.  It's simply the logistics of trying to
</I>&gt;<i> support hundreds of users with varying degrees of experience.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I hope that clarifies things a bit!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Chris/Fleep

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Hello there,

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Ive never used singularity. Please share your thoughts. Is the fps for

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> They're not better, or worse, just different.  Firestorm has some

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Sort of a shame a specific viewer was &quot;recommended&quot; for the conference
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if it was.  I don't see a good reason for it (other than singularity

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For the record Melanie is a commit-er on the Singularity project so she
