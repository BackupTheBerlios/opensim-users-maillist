<PRE>That's very odd because the output of &quot;show stats&quot; is extremely similar to diagnostics.  Diagnostics does log some extra 
information, but nothing which should cause this kind of issue.

To be honest, this should be configurable but I am really strapped for time right now.  It would be very handy if you 
could try disabling this manually by commenting out the lines (80-81)

             m_periodicDiagnosticsTimer.Elapsed += new ElapsedEventHandler(LogDiagnostics);
             m_periodicDiagnosticsTimer.Enabled = true;

in the BaseOpenSimServer() constructor in BaseOpenSimServer.cs and see if that makes a difference.

Could this possibly be some issue with writing anything to console?  Do you have logging settings which would otherwise 
write data?

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> It seems like every hour when the diagnostics is ran it results in hanging my entire system up for about 30 - 45 seconds
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> which results in a variety of interesting things such as the viewer hanging up entirely for that duration, music stops
