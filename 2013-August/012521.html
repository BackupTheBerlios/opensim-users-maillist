<PRE>The mesh exporter can theoretically increase land impact because it 
translates each face into a separate object. If you upload it as-is with 
out any prep work done to the resulting .obj file you can end up with a 
high land impact. For example, a cube has 6 faces on it. Mesh exporter 
would translate each face to a separate object. If uploaded with out any 
modification to it, you would now have an object with a land impact of 6 
because those objects weren't joined together in say... Blender (or your 
3D editor of choice); If you unlinked the object you would find that you 
can edit and move each side of the cube as if it were it's own prim. You 
would have to import the object to your editor, apply a material to each 
side of the cube (to preserve the fact that each side is a face. If you 
simply just joined all the sides with no materials then you would end up 
with a cube that has only 1 face) and then join all those sides together 
into one object. Then when you export that to .dae and upload it, you 
now have a cube that only takes 1 land impact, still has 6 faces, and is 
all one object (that is, you can't edit each side and move them around 
individually).

It's ultimately up to the person exporting mesh to do that work or not, 
but with a little patience, the resulting export can be worked to have 
the same land impact as the original.

There's plenty of reasons why someone would want to do this. For 
example, I had an old attachment I created a while back that was roughly 
30 prims. By converting it to mesh, I was able to edit and join lots of 
pieces together (using up to 8 materials per object) into a single 
object. The result? 3 prim count and an attachment that is worlds easier 
to size to your avatar. It was also able to be rigged with some pretty 
decent results.
