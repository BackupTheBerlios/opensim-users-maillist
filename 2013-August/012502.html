<PRE>System lockups accompanied with a lot of disk activity are often (but not
always) a sign of insufficient RAM memory. If your system is as you
described and is *functioning properly* then I'd recant my suggestion that
you are low on memory. However, on a multicore system with lots of extra
RAM there isn't really anything OpenSim would do to cause lockups. Does it
happen only when 3D graphics applications are running? Or, can it lock up
when OpenSim is the only program running?

</I>&gt;<i> I don't believe I am low on system memory... It has 11 gigs in it and only
</I>&gt;<i> using ~37% of it overall even after running my viewer and OpenSim for a
</I>&gt;<i> while and not much else running aside from that except the occasional
</I>&gt;<i> browser window and maybe Winamp; although I do experience the lockups with
</I>&gt;<i> nothing else running except OpenSim and a single viewer. OpenSim's memory
</I>&gt;<i> use has always been ~500 - 600 MB give or take a few of course.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My video card should be more than capable; but I don't usually have the
</I>&gt;<i> settings ramped up to the highest for everyday use.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Average CPU use is about ~30% - 40% most of the time; much of it being my
</I>&gt;<i> viewer. I have tried setting CPU affinity to processor 3 for the viewer so
</I>&gt;<i> that OpenSim has the other 3 cores to do stuff with but to not much avail.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The system was last rebooted about 3 hours ago as of this writing where I
</I>&gt;<i> have continued using OpenSim and experienced the lock ups since then.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Windows was recently reinstalled fresh on the system to rule out
</I>&gt;<i> possibility of malware, corruption, or something else screwy going on there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I gathered together a few bits of system info that might be helpful (While
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim and a viewer has been running for a while):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim memory use as reported by show stats command:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> MEMORY STATISTICS
</I>&gt;<i> Allocated to OpenSim objects: 306 MB
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim last object memory churn    : 0.559 MB/s
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim average object memory churn : 1.051 MB/s
</I>&gt;<i> Process memory              : 599 MB
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Memory use as reported by Windows Task Manager:
</I>&gt;<i> Total: 11263
</I>&gt;<i> Cached: 4553
</I>&gt;<i> Available: 7029
</I>&gt;<i> Free: 2728
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> and my system setup:
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSim: 10 Region Standalone on 0.7.6 Dev
</I>&gt;<i> Physics: Open Dynamics Engine
</I>&gt;<i> OS: Windows 7 (x64)
</I>&gt;<i> CPU: AMD Phenom II X4 840 3.2 GHz
</I>&gt;<i> Video: GeForce GTX 560 Ti (1 GB)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Memory: 11 GB DDR3
</I>&gt;<i> Database: MySQL 5.1.63 (x64)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At one point in OpenSim's development not too long ago (I don't remember
</I>&gt;<i> exactly when, probably sometime before mid to late 0.7.5's development)
</I>&gt;<i> this was never an issue; I never saw any lockups. Nothing has changed on my
</I>&gt;<i> system hardware wise and very minimal change has been done on my regions
</I>&gt;<i> since then except for the fact that I try to keep my server up to date with
</I>&gt;<i> the latest development code when possible. I do understand the risks of
</I>&gt;<i> this and I'm perfectly happy to be a tester for it :) I suppose my question
</I>&gt;<i> now though is... Why would it be happening in the more recent code?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm by no means an expert when it comes to memory use which is why I'm
</I>&gt;<i> asking a ton of questions and trying to provide as much info as I can think
</I>&gt;<i> of :) My apologies if I'm asking too many.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Many thanks for the help and suggestions so far!
