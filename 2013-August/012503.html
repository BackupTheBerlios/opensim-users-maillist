<PRE>Something like this i have seen on windows 8 with normal usage. not with 
opensim.
The p[roblem where finally a wrong used or missing sata / controller 
driver for the chipset.

</I>&gt;<i>     Hi Dahlia,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I don't believe I am low on system memory... It has 11 gigs in it
</I>&gt;<i>     and only using ~37% of it overall even after running my viewer and
</I>&gt;<i>     OpenSim for a while and not much else running aside from that
</I>&gt;<i>     except the occasional browser window and maybe Winamp; although I
</I>&gt;<i>     do experience the lockups with nothing else running except OpenSim
</I>&gt;<i>     and a single viewer. OpenSim's memory use has always been ~500 -
</I>&gt;<i>     600 MB give or take a few of course.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     My video card should be more than capable; but I don't usually
</I>&gt;<i>     have the settings ramped up to the highest for everyday use.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Average CPU use is about ~30% - 40% most of the time; much of it
</I>&gt;<i>     being my viewer. I have tried setting CPU affinity to processor 3
</I>&gt;<i>     for the viewer so that OpenSim has the other 3 cores to do stuff
</I>&gt;<i>     with but to not much avail.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     The system was last rebooted about 3 hours ago as of this writing
</I>&gt;<i>     where I have continued using OpenSim and experienced the lock ups
</I>&gt;<i>     since then.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Windows was recently reinstalled fresh on the system to rule out
</I>&gt;<i>     possibility of malware, corruption, or something else screwy going
</I>&gt;<i>     on there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I gathered together a few bits of system info that might be
</I>&gt;<i>     helpful (While OpenSim and a viewer has been running for a while):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     OpenSim memory use as reported by show stats command:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     MEMORY STATISTICS
</I>&gt;<i>     Allocated to OpenSim objects: 306 MB
</I>&gt;<i>     OpenSim last object memory churn    : 0.559 MB/s
</I>&gt;<i>     OpenSim average object memory churn : 1.051 MB/s
</I>&gt;<i>     Process memory              : 599 MB
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Memory use as reported by Windows Task Manager:
</I>&gt;<i>     Total: 11263
</I>&gt;<i>     Cached: 4553
</I>&gt;<i>     Available: 7029
</I>&gt;<i>     Free: 2728
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     and my system setup:
</I>&gt;<i>     OpenSim: 10 Region Standalone on 0.7.6 Dev
</I>&gt;<i>     Physics: Open Dynamics Engine
</I>&gt;<i>     OS: Windows 7 (x64)
</I>&gt;<i>     CPU: AMD Phenom II X4 840 3.2 GHz
</I>&gt;<i>     Video: GeForce GTX 560 Ti (1 GB)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Memory: 11 GB DDR3
</I>&gt;<i>     Database: MySQL 5.1.63 (x64)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     At one point in OpenSim's development not too long ago (I don't
</I>&gt;<i>     remember exactly when, probably sometime before mid to late
</I>&gt;<i>     0.7.5's development) this was never an issue; I never saw any
</I>&gt;<i>     lockups. Nothing has changed on my system hardware wise and very
</I>&gt;<i>     minimal change has been done on my regions since then except for
</I>&gt;<i>     the fact that I try to keep my server up to date with the latest
</I>&gt;<i>     development code when possible. I do understand the risks of this
</I>&gt;<i>     and I'm perfectly happy to be a tester for it :) I suppose my
</I>&gt;<i>     question now though is... Why would it be happening in the more
</I>&gt;<i>     recent code?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I'm by no means an expert when it comes to memory use which is why
</I>&gt;<i>     I'm asking a ton of questions and trying to provide as much info
</I>&gt;<i>     as I can think of :) My apologies if I'm asking too many.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Many thanks for the help and suggestions so far!

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     up a lot of swapping time when Windows decides to move things
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     around. A reboot can help when this happens.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     I'd guess that the timer driven diagnostic might trigger a page
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     swap to bring in a part of opensim that had been swapped out, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     that might trigger the operating system to move a lot of stuff
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     around which will lock up the system for a while. You probably
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     don't see it with the &quot;show stats&quot; command as those pages might
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     already be resident in memory when you invoke the command.
