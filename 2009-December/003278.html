<PRE>Hi everyone,

this is my first posting to this list and I would like to introduce myself
with a few words.

I am a content creator for Second Life Technology and I have been testing
OpenSimulator for a while now. I joined 'Second Life' 2006 and became a
virtual watches designer by taking free classes in SL. I met my GF in SL and
she moved from Houston/Texas to Germany, where we now live together.
We both are also SL Solution Provider.

Friends and I started a Product development Community in SL and one of our
first developments was a multiple Choice Quiz System for SL Technology.
I am convinced of OpenSimulator because of the possibility of .oar and .iar
files which are such an amazing advantage, compared to what, lets say
&quot;closed proprietary grids&quot; offer.

To come to an end and the question I would like to have answered:

*Is there a reliable way to protect the source of a script in a .oar file ?*

Frankfurt, Germany

p.s. I am currently looking for an additional team member, a perl developer,
who would be responsible to further develop the community shop features:

The &quot;Marble Isle Quiz System&quot; was nominated for the European Innovative
Games Award 2009 in the category 'Advancement Prize' Innovative Application
Methods &amp; Environments, which is an encouraging recognition for a
SL/OpenSimulator application.

Our Team so far:

What we have so far:
We alreday have an in-world vendorsystem with a currency/credit feature:
