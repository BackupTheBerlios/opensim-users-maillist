Robert, the OpenVCE assets OAR was built on 0.6.5.1 via a region on 
New World Grid.

Karen, I assume you mean that in a good way... and are not referring 
to things we have left as clutter underground?  We did tidy up a few 
lost items from the builds that had shot up to 768m as is common!

Here is a bit more information for those interested in the assets... 
<A HREF="http://openvce.net/vwassets">http://openvce.net/vwassets</A>

The main buildings are rezzed ready to copy on the region using a 
smallish number of elements for the main buildings where necessary 
(we found that better than trying to do auto-rezzing using builders 
buddy just now), and in the boxes are textures, orientation signs, 
landscaping elements.  A few other useful things like flags of the 
worlds, and two buildings from other open source developers that we 
have found useful on our education and collaboration sims are on a 
rack near the central plaza. Also included is a &quot;freeview&quot; screen 
using the usual open source Second Life script (version 1.2) but 
modifed by us and other open source developers to add YouTube url 
mapping, and fix a problem with media type setting in the original 
script in recent versions of the SL viewer.

We assume people will take into inventory the buildings they want to 
use for classrooms, meeting spaces, brain storming rooms, operations 
centres and what not, and then build their own layout as they find it 
most helpful.  The buildings are designed to be reskinned and 
coloured very easily.

Note other element will be coming from the OpenVCE.net community 
including new presentation screens that allow for web based upload of 
PDF presentation, zipped sets of images, etc. We expect those also to 
work in Opensim when released.

We thanks those in the Opensim community who have already contributed 
and assisted us, and encourage anyone interested to join in and 
contribute to the OpenVCE.net community via <A HREF="http://openvce.net">http://openvce.net</A> - 
although its initial focus is to support collaboration between 
emergency responders, it is set up to allow other communities to eb 
supported, and the whole Drupal based web and virtual web side to be 
replicated and hosted by new communities.
