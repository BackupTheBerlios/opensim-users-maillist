&gt;<i> Hi, I wish to get a feeling for your opinions about the OpenSim

</I>
&quot;Maybe&quot;. OpenSim isnt being built as a SL Server Simulator - it's being 
built as a more generalised platform for 3D application hosting - this 
means that while we are compatible with them, there isnt nessecarily a 
focus on having every feature SL does by default (although it should be 
pluggable with modules). Likewise - we will have features SL doesnt. 
(and we already do.)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What about voice? Is it foreseen for 1.0?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Again 'maybe'. There's a lot of people interested in it - so chances are 
  yes, but it depends if someone chooses to implement it or not.

&gt;<i> Is 1.0 meant to have full C# scripting capabilities (full like today's

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
You can use C# today -- just prefix your script with a
//C#
as the first four characters, then check out this page.

I'm sure we can add JavaScript easily enough as well via the JS.NET 
compiler.

&gt;<i> I understand any &quot;improvements&quot; upon the SL server will be postponed
</I>&gt;<i> to after the 1.0 release in order not to break compatibility with the
</I>&gt;<i> SL viewer. Correct?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Nope. We dont need to break compatibility with the viewer to add 
improvements -- there's a lot which I'd like to begin focusing on this 
year, especially around the area of things like Meshes.

&gt;<i> Is integration of documents formats (MS Office or Open Office) a la
</I>&gt;<i> Qwaq Forum on the roadmap?
</I>
This is probably a good idea - I'd like to use standard formats where 
possible, but in the event we cant we definetely should be documenting them.

Regards,

Adam
