<PRE>[I had trouble getting subscribed and my previous post(s) seem 
to have been bit-bucketed. sorry if this ends up a 
double-post!]


I had made some man-hole cover textures for my own build which 
were trivial to alter to make them generic to OGS. They are at:

<A HREF="http://members.optusnet.com.au/~laemi/ogs/">http://members.optusnet.com.au/~laemi/ogs/</A>

The manhole parts were created from scratch in inkscape and gimp 
with visual reference to googled images.

The SVG stencil is there too. To make my cast-iron look, I 
exported as PNG then used gimp to set the colour output range 
from 63-191 (grey) then applied a few RGB noise filters (in 
greyscale).

Also in the folder is a solar cell which was from a googled 
image but has been so heavily altered that less than 25% of the 
original remains and I would challenge anyone to find a match 
with the original ;-P

I release all files in this ogs directory as public domain. If 
anyone wants them, grab a copy, as I may take the files down in 
a few weeks if I need the space.

Cheers.
