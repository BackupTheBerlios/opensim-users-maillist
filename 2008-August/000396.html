<PRE>Hello, and sorry for the interruption.  I would like to run the
client/viewer on a server, so that it is a web application.  My skills
are definitely better than the average person, though I am far from an
expert.  Anyway, I have been looking for weeks for some sort of program,
etc., that would allow me to put the viewer on my server and then let me
access it through the web.  I, probably like a lot of people, can not
run applications at work, so that is the main reason I would like to do
this.  Do any of you have a recommendation as to software that would
allow me to run the viewer as a web application.  Many thanks in
advance,

Drew
