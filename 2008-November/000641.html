</I>This very impressive and nice use of OpenSim along the lines of what I
was thinking about. For teaching discrete event simulation, the entire 
messaging
passing approach seems to lend itself well to this (assuming FIFO
ordering on event queues for a region). For continuous simulation,
your vehicles appear to be updating position at a decent frequency.
Did you use llSetPos() and was there a delay or did you run flat-out
at whatever the server could muster?

For some reason, my simple test was not good, perhaps because I was
moving too short a distance during updates. I'll retry again later tonight.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That was back in late August; the opensim API has changed considerably 
</I>&gt;<i> since then and I haven't had time to update my module yet. I didn't 
</I>&gt;<i> use physics; it was all done with periodic updates to the objects' 
</I>&gt;<i> state, just like in traditional simulation. It works pretty well, only 
</I>&gt;<i> starting to break when there are more than 2 avatars in scene; the 
</I>&gt;<i> breakage is because we have the server behind a home DSL, so packets 
</I>&gt;<i> start getting lost.
</I>Yes, I could see how too many updates could be a problem depending on 
the server
and location of clients.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In general, for doing tradional simulations forget about using inworld 
</I>&gt;<i> scripting. Even if the scripting engine was already working well, 
</I>&gt;<i> which is not, that introduces a lot of unnecessary overhead. 
</I>I suppose I was wondering whether the overhead could be removed or 
minimized for
running standalone servers (or at least, servers with no more than 1 or 
2 avatars)...
&gt;<i> Moreover, it also imposes a programming model that is an obstacle to 
</I>&gt;<i> simulations (for example, not being able to hold references to objects 
</I>&gt;<i> and having to interact with them via llSay functions). 
</I>Yes, having the option for direct referencing would be useful.
&gt;<i> The opensim API, on the other hand, is a joy to work with (how many 
</I>&gt;<i> times have I said this? :-)
</I>
When you say the opensim API are you referring to LSL, the C# interface, 
or something else?
I've been using LSL, but haven't seen any docs on the C# API yet.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am curious as to whether it could become possible (in a standalone

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in a grid with only one person) to do continuous visual updates for moving
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> objects (physical or otherwise). I have tried a few experiments, such as a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> continuously moving block using LSL (setpos) and after a few seconds, the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> behavior becomes erratic (for example, the box shoots off somewhere or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> disappears entirely from the region).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I realize that having fast moving visual objects does not lend itself

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> state, but there are some instances where one wishes to simply launch a

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or grid and do more traditional simulation (as one might do in OpenGL) 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> whether
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or not the object states are shared, or on the frequency of sharing. It 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would be nice
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to have this &quot;standalone continuous object motion&quot; as a switch-based or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> deltatime-specified capability.
