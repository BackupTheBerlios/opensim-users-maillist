<PRE>I have written a region module that does traffic simulation. Here's a 
video produced by my students:
<A HREF="http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=kJNDcurLP1w">http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=kJNDcurLP1w</A>

That was back in late August; the opensim API has changed considerably 
since then and I haven't had time to update my module yet. I didn't use 
physics; it was all done with periodic updates to the objects' state, 
just like in traditional simulation. It works pretty well, only starting 
to break when there are more than 2 avatars in scene; the breakage is 
because we have the server behind a home DSL, so packets start getting lost.

In general, for doing tradional simulations forget about using inworld 
scripting. Even if the scripting engine was already working well, which 
is not, that introduces a lot of unnecessary overhead. Moreover, it also 
imposes a programming model that is an obstacle to simulations (for 
example, not being able to hold references to objects and having to 
interact with them via llSay functions). The opensim API, on the other 
hand, is a joy to work with (how many times have I said this? :-)
