<PRE>Well, it's running scripts for prims in the region also isn't it...  And physics for physical items in the scene the region is managing. (These are assumptions, feel free to clarify, like Paul I'm trying to learn.)

Subject: Re: [Opensim-users] grid operation

Right.
When your region is connected to a physical grid, your region is *just* a 3D space server, nothing else.
All assets belong to the asset server, all inventories belong to the inventory server, all users belong to the user server.

Got it. So, the data are stored on the asset server. If this is

so, it doesn't seem that my region server (the opensim instance

I might run as part of someone's grid) is doing much of

anything since any change in prim or agent attribute must be

conveyed back to the grid's asset server.

Diva Canto wrote:



By &quot;assets&quot; I mean the data itself, the blobs/text/etc.

The region prims/primitems storage holds only references to that data.



Look inside OpenSim.db. There is no &quot;data&quot; there, only meta data and

references to the data (by UUID) stored on the asset server.



Paul Fishwick wrote:



When you say the prims and primitems are not assets, I am confused.

My understanding was that all items are assets, identified by their unique

UUIDs. If I follow the point about the asset server, the asset servers

stores all asset UUID references by region, but that the specific asset

attributes (i.e., position of an object, or its texture) are stored by UUID

in the region's DB?

-p





Diva Canto wrote:





The asset server holds the assets for the entire collection of regions

on that physical grid. For example, when you create an object inworld,

the asset corresponding to that object is stored on the asset server.



The region caches some assets in memory. For example, in that creation

scenario, the asset would be on the cache of the region too.



The region also has a database storing &quot;prims&quot; and &quot;primitems&quot;. These

are not assets; they are the prims that are inworld at any given time.

The prims refer to assets (by UUID) that are stored on the asset

server. Which, as the previous sentence says, may be cached in memory

of the region.



Paul Fishwick wrote:





Right. But what, exactly, are these servers doing?  I guess I am trying

to get at more of the architectural details of what types of messages are

sent among servers (over the network and to the database(s)). For

example, there are the UGAIM servers in grid mode. Does the grid's &quot;A&quot;

server hold all of the assets on your region that  you plugged into the

grid? Or does your region database (on the same computer as your

opensim.instance) take care of that?

If you run 1 region in a grid, you only run OpenSim server, the others

servers (User, Grid, Asset, Inventory and Message) are running on the

Grid servers with the grid OpenSim server.







Paul Fishwick wrote:









If one hooks a region to a grid, what functions does the

region server (operating on your computer) perform? The

Grid servers are running asset and inventory management,

so does this mean that the grid A and I machines handle

the assets and inventory or is that the function of the region

server that connects to the grid?
