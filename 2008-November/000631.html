Yes, things are stored in memory with a regular flush to database that occurs every 15 seconds.  However, I suspect that 
objects with the physics attribute are not currently persisted (from a recent thread on opensim-dev).

&gt;<i>

</I>
I think that some minor stuff is done client side already (such as flexiprims).  However, I suspect one runs into 
difficulties when objects can affect each other, since you would have to start communicating all this information back 
to the server and somehow synchronizing it with changes from other clients.

However, I am not an expert in this area.
