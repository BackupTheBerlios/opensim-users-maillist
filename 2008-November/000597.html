<PRE>This is a on going issue I have had in all of my ventures into grids running
on opensim platforms.  The textures on avatars will not fully render, they
stay mushie always. I can get them to fully render if I rebake, or go into
appearances.  If i rebake they will fully render be crystal clear for 10 to
30 sec..then they well go mushie again perhaps rendering a little more fully
after time but never get a full render.  If I go into appearances I get full
render while in appearances but as soon as go out of appearance mode it gose
strait back to the mushis half-baked look.

This only applies to textures on avatars be they skin, clothing or the like.
 I have tried several incarnations of viewers I get the same in all of them.
 I have checked all the basics on my computer system.  Graphics card is not
top of the line but soild and runs many other graphic intensive games.  The
drivers are up to date. My connection is dsl, all be it slow end dsl it is
still stable enough to run SL and other on-line games with latancy with in a
playiable realm.

I do not have this avatar mushie texture issue on SL.  After asking lots of
people, and being told it's my graphics card, it's my connection, it's
this..it's that... I thought I would toss this issue out to others with more
opensim specific knowlege.  I could understand the graphics card problem if
I was seeing other programs manfesting graphic card issues I am not. Plus I
have run benchmarks and the card performs well with in a acceptiable norm to
run SL.  If it were my connection the textures would eventually render all
be it slowly.  In opensim grid I was on one region building in one spot for
2 plus hours...and never got full render for on my avatar textures.  Plus
the texture can render they do right after a rebake, or in appearance mode.
They just don't hold the render. I render textures on prims perfectly fine.

Any thoughts..on this,  ways to correct it. Is it my issue alone?

Advice would be greatly appciated.
