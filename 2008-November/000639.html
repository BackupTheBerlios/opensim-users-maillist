I am curious as to whether it could become possible (in a standalone 
server or
in a grid with only one person) to do continuous visual updates for moving
objects (physical or otherwise). I have tried a few experiments, such as a
continuously moving block using LSL (setpos) and after a few seconds, the
behavior becomes erratic (for example, the box shoots off somewhere or
disappears entirely from the region).

I realize that having fast moving visual objects does not lend itself 
well to sharing
state, but there are some instances where one wishes to simply launch a 
region
or grid and do more traditional simulation (as one might do in OpenGL) 
whether
or not the object states are shared, or on the frequency of sharing. It 
would be nice
to have this &quot;standalone continuous object motion&quot; as a switch-based or
deltatime-specified capability.

Thoughts?
