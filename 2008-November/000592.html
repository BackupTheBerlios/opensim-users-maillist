<PRE>I *think*we are fairly close with ODE to getting physical vehicles working. The rub seems to be that our physical objects act like they are made from springs. For instance making a tube and putting a ball inside it, or making a pole and putting a ring around it, when they are both physical causes them to jump around with the inter penetration forces.

It looks like some manipulation of ERP (Error Reduction Parameter) or CFM (Constraint Force Mixing) along with a possible density change (I think our objects may be too light), could get us the ability to reliably issues forces and do F=MA.

We will never be like havoc, but, ... I think we should go ahead and get our physical stuff to the next stage. We are ready for that. I am studying the physics in my spare time (hah) right now, as I think this is important, but some help in getting to the next stage would be greatly appreciated.

Charles

Well, the LSL functions probably won&#8217;t do &#8211; unfortunately they
are very tied to the Havok internal API, and while we could probably write a neutral
bridge for them to the ODE/Bullet/etc equivalents, it&#8217;s a lot of work and they
still probably won&#8217;t behave exact the same as SL&#8217;s (i.e. necessitating rewrites
and tweaks anyway).
 
I&#8217;m thinking at the moment it may be easiest to make a set of os
functions to replace the Linden ones, with hooks into a generic &#8216;Vehicle Module&#8217;
for the moment. It would be the fastest way to go right now vs implementing the
Linden set.

Yes, Adam, typically on the
linden grid this is done with vehicle functions in LSL. One thing that occurred
to me is that this might actually be much easier to accomplish on osgrid using
mono. It might also help lay some groundwork for a way forward to implementing
more SL-like vehicle funtions down the road.

I have spoken with one of SL's finer sailboat makers in-world, one MothGirl
Dibou (I hope I have her name right). She has recently done some
sailing-related work in SL in mono (a windsetter, as it's called, that produces
competition wind, and I encouraged us to get in the pit and show some love wrt
sailing specifically, and vehicle physics in general, but have not heard from
her for a few days; the community has been rather busy protesting and
negotiating concerning the Open Spaces price hikes.

I'd be willing to carry whatever load here I can, count me in for some light
coding testing, what have you. As usual, my regions are available for
prototying/testing/debugging/repros.

Cheers!
James

This probably relies on vehicle physics - I've had some
interest in implementing this myself recently, although I'm not 100% sure I
have the time. If you guys have programmers, maybe I can give some direction on
what's needed in order to write a sailing boat module.

In theory it's not too complex (maybe a little, but it's self contained at
least).
