&gt;<i> PROPOSAL FOR SIM VERSION FILTERING

</I>&gt;<i> is upgrading quite often (which is the case in large development test grids).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There has been a proposal (in <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=2361">http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=2361</A>) to have the region server send its SVN 
</I>&gt;<i> revision number to enable filtering by the grid server.  However, I'm not a fan of this idea for the reasons outlined in 
</I>&gt;<i> the e-mails further below (ties us into a source control system, not necessarily present in binaries/source, not 
</I>&gt;<i> friendly to non OpenSim implementations).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, I am going to propose that there is an interface version number in OpenSim.Framework.Servers.VersionInfo.cs. 
</I>&gt;<i>   This is separate from the OpenSim version, and would increase by 1 every time a change was made to OGS1 or interregion 
</I>&gt;<i> interfaces that was incompatible with older versions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So the sequence would be 1, 2, 3, 4, ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On region connection, the version number would be sent.  If it differs from that of the grid, the grid would refuse 
</I>&gt;<i> connection with a message advising version upgrade (or possibly downgrade)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The advantages of this approach are that
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> a)  We don't use the SVN revision number
</I>&gt;<i> b)  Grid operators don't have to manually determine which regions are compatible
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The disadvantages are
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> a)  Developers have to upgrade the number themselves.  I don't believe this is a huge burden.  It's also not a disaster 
</I>&gt;<i> if this is forgotton - one just upgrades it on the next commit.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This may be the simplest thing that could possibly work whilst avoiding the disadvantages of using the SVN number.  One 
</I>&gt;<i> can get more elaborate (e.g. minor verion numbers for compatible changes) but I don't think the complication is 
</I>&gt;<i> worthwhile or known to be workable at this point.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Comments?

+1 on this approach.  I like not using svn version, as that restricts
compatibility too much.  I also think we'll have a good success rate at
figuring out that something is destabalizing change.

I'd *highly* suggest this goes in before 0.6, so that 0.6 regions
participate in this system.  This will be important as a lot of people
will probably go to 0.6 when it comes out and get off the svn tracking
at that point.
