<PRE>... reading your last comment in this thread, I'd add something that I noticed, which I thought was unrelated but maybe isn't.
 
I found out that when I run a fresh opensim, create several users and log them in and out again, the number of processes shows this behaviour:
 
# of users     # of processes
0              35 
1              45
2              50
3              55
4              63
5              70
4   (missed this one)
3              65
2              64
3              66
2              63
3              67
2              64
3              67
2              64
3              68
2              65
1              62
 
 
So, all in all every login/logout adds processes.
 
 
This was back then  r7971 under Debian with Mono 2.0.1, compiled from DrScofields script he provides on his blog (thanks btw).
 
I thought that the number of process is not correlated but maybe I am wrong, and this adds something to the picture.

	Hi,

	 

	I am trying to chase down an issue I encounter with revisions higher than 7707.

	 

	This is what I did: I start from scratch with the standard island, and create some user accounts. Then I log in with two avatars. Everything is ok up until then.

	 

	The behaviour I see then is that all avatars freeze right after the third (or sometimes fourth) agent logs in. Again, this happens even on an empty island with no scripts and just ruths.

	 

	Chat and everything works, you can turn around, but no one can move anymore. The first Avatar always works fine and then usually the third or fourth avatar freezes all of them. Then after some time hitting the cursor keys and trying to move one of them (like 20 to 30 seconds) the avatar all of a sudden moves but doesnt stop for again a quite long time. It is like only fractions of commands come through to the server.

	 

	This only seems to happen on Linux: I tried Debian or Ubuntu with Mono 1.9 or Mono 2.0 in standalone mode. I didnt try any Gridmodes.

	 

	The annoying part is that when I switch between r7707 and r8068 I switch this behaviour on and off (in r7707 this seemed to be either not an issue or not so much of an issue - it doesn't show the freezes).

	 

	Can someone enlighten me to what could cause this and how I could track this down?

	 

	(I had a conversation with Myra-L on IRC this morning and the suggestion was to use different ports from the client. I tried this but it didnt change anything).

	 

	 

	Thanks very much,

	  Dirk/Barth
