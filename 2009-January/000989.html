<PRE>Thanks for everyone's contributions. This has been great.

 

We have run OpenSim under Ubuntu and Windows 2003 server and my findings are
similar. We seem to have a lot more restarts with the Linux platform.
However, we a lot more happy supporting Linux, hence initial question.

 

But based on people's responses, maybe it would be less overhead with me to
get comfortable with Windows installation.

 

Regards,

 

Olli

I could run opensim (SVN #7894) quite stable during the last week. 4 regions
did run for 3 days without any restart required. 4 regions needed a daily
restart and 1 region about every two days.

I run my region servers on two Intel quadcore servers with 4 GB memory under
Mono 2.3. One server uses Ubuntu 8.10 32 bit (4 regions), the other server
Ubuntu 8.04 64 bit (5 regions).

Usually there are only problems with regions that have much traffic and/or
with much building activity. Usually that increases memory consumption over
time, until the region server crashes finally. I use a tool called &quot;monit&quot;
that restarts the region processes automatically before that happens.

Regards,

  Snoopy

I'm no expert - and for the record, I prefer Linux on all things
server side - but I heard that on the same hardware, OpenSim will
perform far better on Windows 2003 Server or XP than on Linux with
Mono, with a far lower crash rate. Has this changed recently? Either
way, I'd love to hear from people on how to properly tune Linux and
Mono in any way to achieve better performance benchmarks.
