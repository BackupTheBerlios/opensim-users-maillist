<PRE>
Excellent to hear that!
 
Basically, I was thinking this would be an excellent opportunity for each grid to further OpenSim and themselves by 
 
* take the opprotunity to demo and publicize noteworthy services or content.
and/or
* set up what we call a 'hypergridded dmz storefront' - in effect, a public standalone region not connected to the main grid services.
and definitively
* blog about this joyous occasion, each telling their own OpenSim story.
 
This would allow each grid to participate in the hypergrid linkfest and birthday celebration club-hopping schemes without jeopardizing any of their content.
 
On the storefront, you could typically set some demo content up
* demoing your grid and what's going on there
* establishing a media parcel url going to a live voice feed so that you could hold voice demonstrations, dj sessions and panel discussions on topics relevant to your grid.* some avatar appearance/merchandise items that you are ready to give to the public domain
 
This is a great opportunity to acquaint yourself with what it means to run a hypergrid region; and we hope to scare a bunch of ugly bugs out of their holes as a result.
 
Regardless,
If you're planning on doing anything for OpenSims second birthday, be sure to post it on

If there is no heading suitable for your project, just make one - it's a wiki! Best regards,Stefan AnderssonTribal Media AB

With&gt; some demo content allowing people to toy around with various aspects of&gt; opensim.&gt; * You grid people, couldn't you set up a region where a group of people&gt; could work cooperative to make a demo 'welcome' island, and then just&gt; save-oar it so we can distribute it with the core distro? So noobs could&gt; just load-oar demo.xml and hey presto!&gt; &gt; And as an added bonus;&gt; &gt; * We should have a simple 'create avatar' as part of the opensim ecosystem.&gt; With this I mean something in the 'register user' or 'create user' that&gt; allows to specify a template for that avatar.&gt; * Tribal just recently added support for inventory cloning and wearing into&gt; the trunk, could you php registration guys (yo redux!) work with us to make&gt; a nice 'choose avatar' step in the registration process?&gt; &gt; Here's saying skol, salut, chin-chin in anticipation of our third year&gt; together. This is going to be a wonderful year!
