<PRE>Folks observed that some aspects of friends are working.  I can see 
now that if you are face to face with another avatar you can add them 
as a friend by right click -&gt; add friend... thanks.  But the general 
Add friend mechanism for someone not present by clicking on friends 
and then using the &quot;Add&quot; button doe snot seem to work.  is that 
right? I can click the add button, lookup an avatar name in that and 
try to add them, but that seems to have no effect.


Slso, a quick question to save me doing a more through check of the 
conditions under which this is an issue.... I am sure I have saved 
multi-part modular builds a while ago and they went into inventory as 
a single multi-part object (using the multi-blocks icon, rather than 
than the single cube object icon) .  But in versions from perhaps Q4 
2008, I now seem to get each object group into inventory... one per 
linked set of objects  That means the spatial relationship between 
the parts of lost if you rez a copy back from inventory.  is 
multi-part object save to inventory faulty?  should I report that on mantis?
