Also, I believe we could just add local server time and current UTC ('metaverse time') to something like the 'about' box text, if people want to make sure.
 
As I understand it,
 
all times shown to users could and should be specified with timezone. The client does this, and there should be no problem converting from UTC to PST/PDT in the protocol endpoints if the client would need us to.
 
In regards to scripts, lsl still have a fairly good number of functions separating 'server time'/'pst' and 'gmt'/'utc';
 
llGetDate uses UTC
llGetWallclock returns the server time.
llGetGMTclock gets GMT, which essentially is UTC
 
I might just be naive, but I don't see the problem with UTC. Could we have a problem scenario detailed out?

Google Calendar works the same way. I just choose my time-zone.  Why not have the viewer show UTC and the local time of the user, just to help the user be able to see the Universal Grid Time at a glance?  All grid serverscould keep their time set by a reliable ntp server and passed on to the viewer/client.Also, in the future, the viewer could very likely simply be a web browser, but I don't want to get too far off topic.~~Fish~~

Hmm, any meeting or event that I have attended on this planet is generallyformatted in the timezone of the host venue. Anyone attending just has todeal with it. What about each simulator uses the timezone of whatever theadmin chooses and each viewer simply runs in the timezone of the user'scomputer? Scripts could therefore depend on that model and adjust themselvesaccordingly. What about a toggle or on/off tick in the viewer? Would it evenneed one?Remember, 2-5 years from now hopefully we will not be depending on the SLviewer as a stop-gap but instead be using the strengths of our own.-Robert

These reasons run from needing mail programs like Outlook to work&gt; correctly. These folks end up at a disadvantage unless we can tell&gt; them how to ensure their OpenSim clock is on UTC.&gt;&gt; Another issue is that the SL client itself seems to favor PST, so we&gt; have client perceptions to deal with. Although as other clients gain&gt; some wider use, this issue is likely to resolve itself over time.&gt;&gt; I would not want either of these to stop a movement towards an OpenSim&gt; Metaverse timezone, but, these are the two major issues that folks&gt; have discussed with me that currently cause them angst.&gt;&gt; With the highest respect to this illustrious group,&gt;&gt; Charles Krinke&gt;&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________&gt; Opensim-users mailing list&gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-users">Opensim-users at lists.berlios.de</A>&gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-users">https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-users</A>&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________&gt; Opensim-users mailing list&gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-users">Opensim-users at lists.berlios.de</A>&gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-users">https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-users</A>&gt;&gt;--View this message in context: <A HREF="http://n2.nabble.com/Correcting-Metaverse-Time-tp2179635p2184858.html">http://n2.nabble.com/Correcting-Metaverse-Time-tp2179635p2184858.html</A>
