<PRE>I think the day the Metaverse started can be considered as &quot;epoch time&quot;, that is, the number of seconds since 1/1/1970. However, that is not the issue.

One issue is that when events on a grid are setup on the grid's timezone, a region might be on a different timezone and a client might be hard-coded to PST. So getting folks to attend an event gets challenging if all regions on a grid are not on the same &quot;clock&quot;.

Additionally, there are scripts that read the underlying clock on the server for a region. In a heterogeneous Metaverse where adjacent sims on a grid might be on opposite sides of the planet, one can see that writing a time for an event, or a script event would then be interpreted differently by a sim on the same timezone as the UGAIM, compared to a sim on a different timezone, *or* a HyperGridded region on a third time zone.

So, it can get messy. Which is why we brought it up, so we could think about it a little bit.

Charles

Subject: Re: [Opensim-users] Correcting Metaverse Time


I see what you mean Charles and maybe the need is to mimic our current planet
by settling on a Metaversal Time as the starting point (MTC or UTC) and
leave open the path for supporting local time zones for local needs? We have
multiple time zones in RL with a single and sensible starting point. Right
now the SLT standard just doesn't seem like a good starting point since
nobody else references it. You mention setting simulators to local time,
does that also show up correctly in the viewer? Is there some tweak to the
OpenSim software, the viewer, or is it just a matter of setting the server
time? Maybe have a setting in the viewr to show either local or MTC?

While we are on the subject, what about setting a day that the metaverse
started? RL has A.D. and B.C., what about this new universe having some sort
of starting point to celebrate? Maybe the first birthday of OpenSim? The
second? What do we call it? In the future there may very well be a need to
reference the start of it all... just a thought. :)

-Robert



Certainly, those running grids and major standalones that are
HyperGridded can easily set their sims to UTC without any additional
prompting from us, and I have already done this with those I can
directly influence.

Now that we seem heading towards some semblance of a consensus, let me open
two itty-bitty &quot;Pandora's Boxen&quot; that others have described to me.

But, there are sims running in folks homes and on servers where for other
then OpenSim reasons, these folks wish the server (or desktop computer in
some cases) to run on the local timezone, where ever it is. These reasons
run from needing mail programs like Outlook to work correctly. These folks
end up at a disadvantage unless we can tell them how to ensure their OpenSim
clock is on UTC.

Another issue is that the SL client itself seems to favor PST, so we have
client perceptions to deal with. Although as other clients gain some wider
use, this issue is likely to resolve itself over time.

I would not want either of these to stop a movement towards an OpenSim
Metaverse timezone, but, these are the two major issues that folks have
discussed with me that currently cause them angst.

With the highest respect to this illustrious group,

Charles Krinke
