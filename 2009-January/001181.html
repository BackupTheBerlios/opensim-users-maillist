Thanks - trying that now, and I'll report back.  If there are any
other Mono tweaks that may improve things, I'd be interested; through
lack of better knowledge I simply use 1.9.1 out-of-the-box.

&gt;<i>What esp does not sound like this bug, is the console freeze. This is something that I didnt experience IIRC.

</I>&gt;<i>Having said that, with freezing applications I always suspect hardware issues, namely faulty RAM.
</I>
True, and what I first suspected too, but moving onto another machine
entirely didn't make any difference in this case.

</I>&gt;<i>Von: <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-users">opensim-users-bounces at lists.berlios.de</A> im Auftrag von John Hopkin

</I>&gt;<i>An: <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-users">opensim-users at lists.berlios.de</A>
</I>&gt;<i>Betreff: [Opensim-users] Odd but persistent symptom [text][bayes]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>Pretty frequently, I've been experiencing lock-ups with OpenSim.exe
</I>&gt;<i>that defy all attempts to diagnose by elimination.   It's been like
</I>&gt;<i>this for several weeks, across various releases up to and including
</I>&gt;<i>8131.  I'll briefly describe the symptoms here in the hope that
</I>&gt;<i>someone might be able to point me in the right direction.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>1.  When it happens, the server is usually up and running, and it's
</I>&gt;<i>much more likely to happen when two avs are logged in (I've not tried
</I>&gt;<i>any more than two) than with one.  It can also happen with only one,
</I>&gt;<i>or with none, and sometimes happens while scripts are still loading
</I>&gt;<i>after starting the server, sometimes after an hour or so of running.
</I>&gt;<i>Sometimes it can be left on overnight with no logins and it'll be
</I>&gt;<i>fine.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>A typical scenario would be one av being logged in without problems
</I>&gt;<i>for quite a long time; when a second av logs in, the server locks up
</I>&gt;<i>within seconds.  This, however, is not a completely universal rule,
</I>&gt;<i>just the most common of the many scenarios.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>2.  What happens is this: the region server stops responding at the
</I>&gt;<i>command line, and nothing more will happen until it's killed off.
</I>&gt;<i>Clients get logged off after timeout.  On a system monitor, one
</I>&gt;<i>virtual CPU (it's a P4, so single-core, but with hyper-threading there
</I>&gt;<i>are two logical CPUs) is going flat-out at around 85-95%, the second
</I>&gt;<i>CPU idling at around the normal 30%.  This persists until the process
</I>&gt;<i>is killed.  Memory usage continues as normal. around 30-50% of the 2GB
</I>&gt;<i>total.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>3.  The server is running in grid mode, with UGAIM services provided
</I>&gt;<i>by OSGrid, on a Ubuntu 8.10 server with Mono 1.9.1.  There are four
</I>&gt;<i>regions serviced by one copy of OpenSim.exe.  Scripting is XEngine,
</I>&gt;<i>physics ODE/Meshmerizer.  There are around 2200 prims in all, with
</I>&gt;<i>perhaps 400 mostly idle scripts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>4. Eliminating each of the regions in turn seems to alleviate the
</I>&gt;<i>problem to a certain degree - most of the time, any single region may
</I>&gt;<i>be run with less problems than all four, but there is little pattern
</I>&gt;<i>to this in the longer term.  In the short term, it may appear that a
</I>&gt;<i>particular region is at fault, but after a day or two the situation
</I>&gt;<i>may change.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>5.  Disabling scripting doesn't seem to have much, if any effect.  No
</I>&gt;<i>script is doing anything particularly exotic, and all are normally
</I>&gt;<i>waiting for events.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>6.  Another thing which sometimes (but not always) helps is to remove
</I>&gt;<i>the mostly recently-rezzed prims.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>7.  I've tried reinstalling Ubuntu, and I've also moved the whole
</I>&gt;<i>thing from one machine to another during this time.  OpenSim has been
</I>&gt;<i>upgraded roughly weekly to the latest stable version hosted by OSGrid.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>It's hard to eliminate anything, because the situation changes so
</I>&gt;<i>often; it may appear to run fine for several hours, with two avs
</I>&gt;<i>making moderate use of the sims for building, etc, then it may barely
</I>&gt;<i>run at all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>If any of this looks familiar to anyone, I'd be very grateful for any
</I>&gt;<i>help.  I think you can imagine how frustrating this has been for
</I>&gt;<i>myself and my partner, being almost completely unable to progress with
</I>&gt;<i>our plans for building the regions into the land of our dreams.  And
</I>&gt;<i>it's particularly galling because of the lack of consistency - we
</I>&gt;<i>never seem to be able to narrow down the cause of the problem.
