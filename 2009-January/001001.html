<PRE>Thank you kindly, Kris, that helps a number of folks.

Since we have some search enabled and currently under test this is
a good time to add searchable parcels of land and prims to the search
database. Thats the reason I suggested additional sims, or even small
1024m parcels with a building, prims and notecards describing various
individual projects, standalones and grids. It is relatively easy to subdivide a sim or a portion of a sim into 1024m parcels. Just start in one corner, get the first one, then fly up about 60m, use the  select tool and symmetry to duplicate several times. Each individual parcel can then be easily indexed into search and whatever is written in the description will be added to search so any word or words are now searchable.

Given a functioning search, we can now flesh out its functionality
and at the same time take advantage of our new OpenSim search to help
folks find each others projects, standalonds and grids. So, this is a
good thing and I believe we should take advantage of it.

Additionally, there are a few folks leasing parcels on their own
sims now on OSGrid. I believe that to be a healthy thing also. The
financial transfer is outside the grid context and that is fine for
now. But, the fact that folks looking for a 1024m parcel can now find
it in search on OSGrid and lease it from its owner for a week, month or
whatever adds health and vitality to the OpenSim part of the Metaverse.

Charles

Hi all, 

I thought it might be useful to also send out this forum topic
regarding the search module for those who aren't familiar with the
option. I had to go looking for it, so i figured others might have to
as well. 

<A HREF="http://osgrid.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=14&amp;t=656&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a&amp;hilit=search#p2457">http://osgrid.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=14&amp;t=656&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a&amp;hilit=search#p2457</A>

Thanks to nebadon for providing the link.

I would
like to make a suggestion that various standalones and grids consider putting up a sim on
OSGrid and enable search and add search terms that allow folks to find your standalone or grid.

The region could have prims that describe your vision and even a
HyperGrid link if you wish.

That way, folks on OSGrid can
more easily find the other standalones and grids as our OpenSim part of the Metaverse builds
out with various grids and standalones. 


What
does OSGrid get out of this? Well, we continue to be a nexus for
OpenSim activity and folks can use OSGrid to find other standalones and
grids as 2009 evolves.
