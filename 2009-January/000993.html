<PRE>Does the default island coming as a .oar file work?

Subject: [Opensim-dev] Proposal: 2nd birthday parties + cleanup

Guys,

first of all, sorry for the cross-post, just wanted to get maximum attention for a worthy cause.

OpenSims 2nd birthday is coming up (jan 29)

I don't propose cheesy 'cultural' events; but:

a) we should have a page on the wiki where everybody could post a short notice about where and when and on what grid parties will be held.
b) I propose the hypergrid community start linking their party regions so we all can go club hopping.
c) As a birthday present to ourselves, I propose a facelift and clean up.

What I mean with c) is:
* Last I saw, our default Library content node sucked.
* Now I'm looking around, I see quite a lot of people making high-grade content available under various compatible licenses.
* Let's work to rally together a high-quality default library.
  * Users, you find content libraries, try it and report it.
  * Creators, you work with devs to find good ways of importing it into the lib.
  * Devs, you start thinking on how to make the importing really really easy.
* What I would like to see is a crem-de-la-creme default library node, Making OpenSim look really god damn good out-of-the-box

anybody up for that?

Also,

* The default island; we really should have a better default island. With some demo content allowing people to toy around with various aspects of opensim.
* You grid people, couldn't you set up a region where a group of people could work cooperative to make a demo 'welcome' island, and then just save-oar it so we can distribute it with the core distro? So noobs could just load-oar demo.xml and hey presto!

And as an added bonus;

* We should have a simple 'create avatar' as part of the opensim ecosystem. With this I mean something in the 'register user' or 'create user' that allows to specify a template for that avatar.
* Tribal just recently added support for inventory cloning and wearing into the trunk, could you php registration guys (yo redux!) work with us to make a nice 'choose avatar' step in the registration process?

Here's saying skol, salut, chin-chin in anticipation of our third year together. This is going to be a wonderful year!

Best regards,
Stefan Andersson
