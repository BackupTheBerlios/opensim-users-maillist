<PRE>Hi everyone,

Child-related interregion comms have practically all been moved to 
RESTComms. The last one I just moved was the creation of child agents on 
the vicinity. What this means is that r7930 will work really badly with 
previous versions: the child agent creation messages will never get to 
sims running older versions, because they don't speak this new part of 
the protocol.

I tried bumping up the MajorInterfaceVersion (in r7929) to flag this 
serious change, but I regretted instantly, and placed it back to what it 
was (in r7930). I regretted it, because I couldn't connect my head sims 
to osgrid... so my conclusion is that this MajorInterfaceVersion process 
isn't really for this kind of change that I'm working on. We just have 
to figure out another way of coping with the evolution of interregion comms.

Anyway, a small note: HG *home* jumps are now slightly broken if you go 
around on a grid that you HG-jumped to. Bear with this while interregion 
comms are being reengineered...
Also, my HG sims in OSGrid and UCI Grid are all on r7930, so if you try 
to jump in from regions with older versions, you'll probably crash.

I will stop working on interregion comms for a week, and will pick it up 
again in a week.

Regards,
Crista
