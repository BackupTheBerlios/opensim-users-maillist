<PRE>I have a realtime in world &quot;media board&quot; that allows users/avatars to draw on it by touching the prim surface and moving the mouse while holding done the button. So it is using the prim surface touch position feature that you were asking about the other day (although its not using LSL).

It also allows you to drag and drop textures on the board, that then open up in a resizable window. And lastly acts as live vnc client to show a remote desktop in a resizable window on the prim. All this is in realtime to the user and there are no delays for instance with texture swapping.

This is all in a module so in theory I could set up a public demo on say osgrid. But its also still at a prototype stage so I'm not completely sure I will get the time to get it ready for a big public demo. But I could have a look into it.

If in addition, we could get a demo of clickable prim with position and a hyperlink, a demo of drawing some graphics with the drawing on a prim logic that Mw added last year and a few other demonstrations of features as part of this, it would help OpenSim significantly.

So, ... I am suggesting that anything that can be done to setup a few demos of OpenSim features like this and others will help us all and want to encourage a few folks to look into it over the next 10 days or so until the birthday celebration on Jan 29th.
