As someone who regularly does telecons and collaborates on projects 
between 2 continents, and sometimes 3, some with participants on time 
zones that are on the half hour (!)  I can tell you that agreement on 
a synced clock is VERY valuable. And avoidance of summer time clock 
shift issues which vary on date of shift across the 
world.  PST/PDT/SLT shifts to pacific summer time when the USA 
does!  And GMT/UTC fits the bill.  When stating deadlines and action 
items for work going on round the world, its essential to state the 
time zone within the time stamp. We usually use the Zulu (i.e. 
UTC/GMT) Internet date/time formats to stamp planning action items.

On my collaboration centre walls in SL and Opensim we put up local 
time clock to help all the particular... more on that shortly 
(perhaps in a  mantis) as my old IBM Wallclock brought over from SL 
(where it works very responsibly) with its one second event timer 
brings my Opensim server setup to its knees with event queue overload 
past 300 queued events, and a massive time of execution level... just 
for ONE clock.  Wheres on SL I have dozens of these clocks on a single sim.
