Umm. How? The &quot;time&quot; function was removed from the [sun] section of
opensim.ini because it had no effect.

Certainly, those running grids and major standalones that are
HyperGridded can easily set their sims to UTC without any additional
prompting from us, and I have already done this with those I can
directly influence.

Now that we seem heading towards some semblance of a consensus, let me 
open two itty-bitty &quot;Pandora's Boxen&quot; that others have described to 
me.

But, there are sims running in folks homes and on servers where for 
other then OpenSim reasons, these folks wish the server (or desktop 
computer in some cases) to run on the local timezone, where ever it 
is. These reasons run from needing mail programs like Outlook to work 
correctly. These folks end up at a disadvantage unless we can tell 
them how to ensure their OpenSim clock is on UTC.

Another issue is that the SL client itself seems to favor PST, so we 
have client perceptions to deal with. Although as other clients gain 
some wider use, this issue is likely to resolve itself over time.

I would not want either of these to stop a movement towards an OpenSim 
Metaverse timezone, but, these are the two major issues that folks 
have discussed with me that currently cause them angst.

With the highest respect to this illustrious group,

Charles Krinke
