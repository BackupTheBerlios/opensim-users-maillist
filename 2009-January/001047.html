<PRE>Ok, all I had to do was ask the naive question in public and Mr. Murphy allowed me to see the answer, so I'll answer the first question myself and then go on.

I can see that a WriteLine(surfaceArgs[0].UVCoord.ToString() + surfaceArgs[0].STCoord.ToString() ) returns a percentage of the form 0.00 ... 0.99 when the prim is touched regardless of its size, so this is a really good thing.

I can also see in the ProcessObjectGrab method in Scene.PacketHandlers.cs that EventManager.TriggerObjectGrab is called with surfaceArg as one of its arguments. Chasing down TriggerObjectGrab, it appears to be coming back to handlerObjectGrab so I seem to be going around in a circle a little bit.

So, if you have the time to explain a bit about the logic flow that should occur after the call to TriggerObjectGrab that gets us closer to being able to use a script to obtain the position on a prim that the mouse is clicking, that would be wonderful.

Charles

Dear Stefan or Darren:

Would you mind terribly explaining a bit more, please?

I can see the ProcessObjectGrab method in Scene.PacketHandlers.cs which receives a List&lt;&gt; surfaceArgs. I can also see in SurfaceTouchEventArgs.cs the members Binormal, FaceIndex, Normal, Position, STCoord &amp; UVCoord.

The first step seems to me to determine if Position, STCoord &amp; UVCoord are entering ProcessObjectGrab with reasonable X,Y positions with a WriteLine. I am showing my naivety a bit, but perhaps we can use this to help others follow along if you could describe how to WriteLine the Position, STCoord &amp; UVCoord (assuming these are reasonable values entering and underlying logic is probably working).

Then once we get to that point, perhaps describing in a tiny synopsis how the connection would be made up to the LSL_Api.cs.

With Respect, Charles

 Charles,
 
Darren tells me the functionailty was added some time ago to the OpenSim svn. OnGrabObject, OnGrabUpdate etc, have a 
List&lt;SurfaceTouchEventArgs&gt; parameter that is the list of x,y touched.

For it to be used in LSL scripts, it just needs someone to wire up the needed functions that LL added for such things, if there is none already.

Best regards,
Stefan Andersson

No problem. &quot;Tx Oh&quot; came up with this about a year ago and it works pretty good.

I am hoping that someone will take on the project of adding mouse position data to the C# code base some time so we can click on areas on the prim and execute hyperlinks, but that is a project in search of a zealot right now.

John, Charles already notified us of the one at Wright Plaza and I posted up the script. However, it will be interesting to see if you get parcel media URLs working.

Olli,
  I've seen a prim that draws a web page over at Wright Plaza on OSGrid.  I'm not sure if its still there, but I always assumed they were using a variation of the WeatherMap script.  You're right though about that script, I just tried and it only works for images.  Also, after trying the SL way of setting the url in the parcel all I wound up with was a black prim.  I'll try to do some more puttering later tonight after I finish melting my brain while reviewing reports at work.  :P

Sorry, &lt;&lt; blushes&gt;&gt;

Hi Orion,
 
That example seems to be with images as well. 
 
Since it looks like the dynamic texture supports only images at the moment, does anyone know how to bring HTML web content in OpenSim? Even the Second Life way whereby you set it as parcel media does not seem to work. So, is there currently no way to bring HTML in?
 
Regards,
 
Olli

In world take a look under your inventory for the OpenSim Library.  There are a few example scripts in there which may help.  

OpenSim Library -&gt; Scripts Library -&gt; OpenSim Specific Scripts -&gt; osWeatherMap

When you open up the script it'll show as locked.  Just ctrl-a ctrl-c to select all and copy, then paste it all into a new script to edit.

Thanks, :)

I think it can only be a picture file, or some type of php that returns a picture. I could be wrong.

Hi all,
 
I have been trying to Google for this, but cannot find answer. Please just point me to documentation if this is an obvious question J
 
Does anyone know which are possible values for the content type parameter with osSetDynamicTextureURL? What I am looking for is a way to set html content as texture. I can find examples for dynamic images but not for html.
 
Thanks for your help in advance,
 
Olli
