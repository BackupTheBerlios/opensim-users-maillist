<PRE>This sounds like you're hitting exactly that: a firewall. Make sure 
there are holes in all the right ports: TCP 9000, and UDP 9000--9003.

</I>&gt;<i> We have really struggled with getting external access sorted. We

</I>&gt;<i> there, and we want to set our home to our grid.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We've tried multiple times, multiple settings, and the closest we got 
</I>&gt;<i> was to get the registration page on the Web set up and working, and 
</I>&gt;<i> the login page on the viewer (Imprudence), and the login process 
</I>&gt;<i> started.  Our UK guy was able to log in from within his network; the 
</I>&gt;<i> two of us in the US are not able to log in from outside.  The logs 
</I>&gt;<i> showed that OpenSim saw us logging in, everything looked great, until 
</I>&gt;<i> we got to the handshake stage; we can't get past that despite trying 
</I>&gt;<i> numerous different settings in the Regions.ini file and on the 
</I>&gt;<i> router.  Someone in some forum mentioned never seeing LLUDPSERVER 
</I>&gt;<i> kicking in; we have never seen that either, so if we were supposed to, 
</I>&gt;<i> that's where our problem seems to lie, but we tried different fixes, 
</I>&gt;<i> but to no avail.  We're incredibly frustrated and demoralised.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Last night, we decided to start over again on two different computers 
</I>&gt;<i> (separate times), but now we can't even get the registration page up 
</I>&gt;<i> and the viewer's grid manager's 'get grid info' can't find our grid 
</I>&gt;<i> address.  We followed the instructions on this page: 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://github.com/diva/d2/wiki/Installation">https://github.com/diva/d2/wiki/Installation</A>  and even tried it with 
</I>&gt;<i> MySQL Workbench on one of the computers while using the command line 
</I>&gt;<i> on the other one.  Both gave us the same result.  NOTE: We did not try 
</I>&gt;<i> to run OpenSim on both computers simultaneously, and we made sure to 
</I>&gt;<i> port forward correctly when attempting one or the other computer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We even invested in a new router from the ISP with a current firmware 
</I>&gt;<i> version that supports NAT Loopback, etc.  We tried creating a DMZ, not 
</I>&gt;<i> having one; we tried turning off uPnP and leaving it on; we tried a 
</I>&gt;<i> numeric IP address for the external address and the FQDN; we tried 
</I>&gt;<i> 0.0.0.0 for internal IP and using an internal address.  Two of us 
</I>&gt;<i> actually worked through the day and all night yesterday/last night 
</I>&gt;<i> trying to get this working multiple times.  We've seen others 
</I>&gt;<i> successfully getting their grids up and externally accessible, so we 
</I>&gt;<i> know it's possible, but that apple seems to be dangling just outside 
</I>&gt;<i> our reach.  It's galling for us because two of us have backgrounds in 
</I>&gt;<i> systems, network, web and database programming spanning more than a 
</I>&gt;<i> decade each.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We REALLY could use some help from someone who has done it 
</I>&gt;<i> successfully (all the way to successful external logins) and maybe 
</I>&gt;<i> wouldn't mind going thru it with us a bit; a fresh pair of eyes and 
</I>&gt;<i> input from someone who has succeeded might spot something we've missed 
</I>&gt;<i> or something we've been doing wrong.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can anyone help, please?
</I>&gt;<i>
