<PRE>Aah, meant to add to my previous email...

I was under understanding that OpenSim and Freeswitch communicate directly
as well as with the client software. Hence if you behind a NAT the following
will happen:


- If you put the public IP address to the config files OpenSim and
Freeswitch cannot communicate
- If you put the private IP address to the config files Freeswitch and the
client software cannot communicate

But maybe I am wrong?

Regards,

Olli

Ok, the reason I am asking is because we have Windows systems with public IP
that work fine.

However, now I am trying to create a working Amazon EC2 instance and cannot
decide if I have problems because Amazon instances are behind NAT or because
I am using Linux.

But I will do some further testing based on your notes below and let you
know.

Regards,

Olli

I cannot be sure on that Olli.  But any port forwarding or translation
method should work, so long as the external address is used consistently in
the config files on both the FreeSwitch and OpenSim sides I think.

Make sure your firewall ports for H.323 call initiation and for the or used
for the type of call made is also open.. that's covered already in the
Freeswitch wiki page firewall section. Its configurable. Basically open
ports 1720 and 5060, and maybe 50505 must be open for listening for the
default setup indicated in OpenSim.ini (for 0.7.1 dev master its in
OpenSimDefaults.ini and must be copied to OpenSim.ini remember. Dynamically
assigned ports are used for specific call traffic. The usual H.323 and SIP
traffic dynamic port handling on modern firewalls usually enable this.

I added some more notes on the wiki for advanced users who want to change
the behaviour when joining calls, single user on hold music turn off etc. We
turn all that off in the freeswitch config file for our usage.
