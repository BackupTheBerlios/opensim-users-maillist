</I>&gt;<i>    e) Save back out to a new .oar file, which I can distribute to our users.

</I>&gt;<i> That's good as far as it goes, but 4b and 4c are still quite laborious

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does anyone know of a way to automate steps 4b/4c? For example, if I

</I>
There isn't any compiled code in the OAR.  The compiled code will actually be in bin/ScriptEngines. under UUID 
directories that represent the different regions.  If you delete these directories then it should force recompilation of 
the scripts on OAR load.  Or you could be even more aggressive and target the dlls with the right asset uuids (I'm 
guessing this is the correspondence of that directory name with the script asset).

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If I could compile each script in the .oar file from the command line
</I>&gt;<i> and saved the compiled code back to the .oar file, that would be even
</I>&gt;<i> better.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Alternatively, can anyone suggest an easier way of getting the LSL
</I>&gt;<i> scripts from Subversion into an .oar or .iar file?
