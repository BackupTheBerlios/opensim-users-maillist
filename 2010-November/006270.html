<PRE>We're getting closer.  We guess!  Now, we've got the opposite issue.
External computers can log in; the UK guy can't get in from inside his
network.  We did as Diva suggested (9000 only for both TCP &amp; UDP; 9001-9003
for UDP only - previously all four ports were opened for both UDP &amp; TCP) and
that got us to this point, thank you Diva!

We're told his router supports NAT loopback (Sagem FAST 2504 from Sky
Broadband).  Not sure that's by default? So, we attempted this method,
hoping that would get him able to log in through his viewer from inside the
network:

*This method was used and successfully tested using www.dyndns.com (creates
a virtual domain for your pc/ip, like yourcomputer.ath.cx) as loopback for
devices on a LAN with three machines (pentium 2.8ghz running windows xp -
internet server , amd opteron running ubuntu 7.10 64bit - as opensim server
- and MacBook with OSX 10.4.11 - as client), a modem (thomson/alcatel
speedtouch 330) and a mini-switch (which brand no one ever heard of). The
connection of these machines is made as following: Modem -&gt; Win Pc -&gt; Switch
-&gt; Mac and Ubuntu. Dyndns is used to loopback to the Win Pc, and then it
forwards the request to the internal LAN opensim server, which grants
everything for the client. As for the client, if he is inside the private
LAN then he is now actually someone on the internet requesting for access to
the opensim server. Thus, if the client is someone on the internet then he
will be treated like that. Tricky ? Further details ahead:

Method:

    * Set the simulator listening IP address to your dyndns domain - edit
opensim/bin/Regions/default.xml; and change the external_host_name to
external_host_name=&quot;yourcomputer.ath.cx&quot;. Leave internal_ip_address
&quot;0.0.0.0&quot; and port &quot;9000&quot;.
    * Set the client (SecondLife Viewer) -loginuri to &quot;
yourcomputer.ath.cx:8002&quot; (the port used was 8002, yours can be different if
you configured it that way) - i didnt used the -loginserver flag also.
    * Port Forward the above ports on the internet server (in this case, win
xp). You do so by creating exceptions in Windows Firewall for the above
mentioned ports, and for both connections: Internet Connection and LAN -
this keeps the ports open for the web requests to travel over the private
network.
    * Edit &quot;hosts&quot; file (on windows, this is
C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts and on Unix-type systems, this is
/etc/hosts) entry on your internet server (in this case, win xp box) and add
the following line: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx     yourcomputer.ath.cx. Of course,
xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx is your opensim server internal LAN IP.

yourcomputer.ath.cx is now available for everyone to connect and you may
login with the client!*

Now, while he was able to get in, the external computers were locked out
again.  He reversed his changes; we're back to external computers being able
to log in, but he can't.  Seems we have an either/or situation, but we want
to have our cake and eat it too...

</I>&gt;<i> fixes, but to no avail.  We're incredibly frustrated and demoralised.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Last night, we decided to start over again on two different computers
</I>&gt;<i> (separate times), but now we can't even get the registration page up and the
</I>&gt;<i> viewer's grid manager's 'get grid info' can't find our grid address.  We
</I>&gt;<i> followed the instructions on this page:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://github.com/diva/d2/wiki/Installation">https://github.com/diva/d2/wiki/Installation</A>  and even tried it with MySQL
</I>&gt;<i> Workbench on one of the computers while using the command line on the other
</I>&gt;<i> one.  Both gave us the same result.  NOTE: We did not try to run OpenSim on
</I>&gt;<i> both computers simultaneously, and we made sure to port forward correctly
</I>&gt;<i> when attempting one or the other computer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We even invested in a new router from the ISP with a current firmware
</I>&gt;<i> version that supports NAT Loopback, etc.  We tried creating a DMZ, not
</I>&gt;<i> having one; we tried turning off uPnP and leaving it on; we tried a numeric
</I>&gt;<i> IP address for the external address and the FQDN; we tried 0.0.0.0 for
</I>&gt;<i> internal IP and using an internal address.  Two of us actually worked
</I>&gt;<i> through the day and all night yesterday/last night trying to get this
</I>&gt;<i> working multiple times.  We've seen others successfully getting their grids
</I>&gt;<i> up and externally accessible, so we know it's possible, but that apple seems
</I>&gt;<i> to be dangling just outside our reach.  It's galling for us because two of
</I>&gt;<i> us have backgrounds in systems, network, web and database programming
</I>&gt;<i> spanning more than a decade each.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We REALLY could use some help from someone who has done it successfully
</I>&gt;<i> (all the way to successful external logins) and maybe wouldn't mind going
</I>&gt;<i> thru it with us a bit; a fresh pair of eyes and input from someone who has
</I>&gt;<i> succeeded might spot something we've missed or something we've been doing
</I>&gt;<i> wrong.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can anyone help, please?
