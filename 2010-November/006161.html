Thanks Dan, you are absolutely right...it was mistakenly picking up the wrong
architecture.  I actually had put the reference to simiangrid.ini into
OpensimDefaults.ini, which I know is bad practice, but I run multiple
instances of opensim.exe for my regions, and because i use unique
opensim.ini files for each region (which I select via the -inifile switch
when starting the instance), I wanted to put the include in a common place
so that I didn't have to change it in multiple files if I wanted to switch
between robust and simian.  However, I outsmarted myself in that I had
earlier put an include reference pointing to grid.ini into the individual
opensim.ini files, before I had decided the method I was going to use.  So,
it was set correctly in the defaults file, but was mistakenly being
overridden when the instance started.

Now that the region is up and running, I have a new set of questions.  It
looks like I can only log in if the user info is contained in the new Simian
tables.  I pointed the URI to <A HREF="http://koolpheller.dyndns.org/login/,">http://koolpheller.dyndns.org/login/,</A> but
could not log in using my existing user accounts.  But when I created a new
user through the website's &quot;Join&quot; tab, I was able to log in successfully
using the new ID.  I am having trouble getting the appearance data to load,
but at least I could sign on.  In other words, it looks like the user data
for Simian is completely separate from the user data for Robust, including
the body part assets.  Is there a migration procedure available that I can
use to move existing users into the new tables?  And is there other info
that will need to be migrated over to the Simian tables?

Also, one other question regarding the installation.  As I mentioned in the
first posting, the file SimianGrid.ini does not show what the overrides
should be for GridServerURI and GridUserServerURI.  I set these up as
&quot;<A HREF="http://koolpheller.dyndns.org/Grid/">http://koolpheller.dyndns.org/Grid/</A>&quot;, which is the same one used for the
others (besides asset).  Is this the right URI to use?  In any case, the
correct override for these two should be listed in SimianGrid.ini.

Thanks to everyone (James, Dan and Chris) for your help on this.  It has
been invaluable.
