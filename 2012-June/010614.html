<PRE>Ahhh I see. I was referring to commit 5f7e39 made around the beginning 
of this year. I must've misunderstood what it meant =)

&gt;<i> Edmund, doing what you describe should be absolutely fine.  In fact,

</I>&gt;<i> allow them to be inspected/constructed/altered by external tools, 
</I>&gt;<i> though it can still be a pretty tricky operation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Changing the UUID is necessary since if an asset already exists with 
</I>&gt;<i> that ID it will be reused.  As long as you use a random UUID and 
</I>&gt;<i> replace all the existing references as you're doing then you should be 
</I>&gt;<i> fine.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Chris, this is the way it has been done for years.  There's no real 
</I>&gt;<i> errors to police - either an asset uuid already exists and so is 
</I>&gt;<i> reused or it does not and so is ignored.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not overwrite existing assets if the asset to be loaded shares the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> same UUID with an asset that already exists in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> database (please correct me on this if I am wrong).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As for manually changing ID's in the IAR itself, I can't attest for 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the safeness of doing it that way. But I would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> imagine it would be relatively safe provided that the ID's are 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> changed in all the spots that they are referenced since
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the IAR loader should be rejecting duplicate UUID load attempts if 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the situation should arise. Opensim devs, please
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> correct me on this as well if I am incorrect =) I would be curious 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> myself to know if this is a safe thing to do.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> This is working fine, except that sometimes the UUIDs of the scripts
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I've faffed with already exist in OpenSim, resulting in the new
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> version not being imported.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (I'm pretty sure that's what's happening - I've tried clearing the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> viewer cache and deleting stuff under bin/ScriptEngines and so forth.)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> To avoid this, I want to change the UUIDs of the scripts I've faffed
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> with in my IAR every time I make a change to their content. I've tried
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> this and it seems to work, but I as I don't understand the internals
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> of this stuff I just wanted to check if there's some important thing
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I'm overlooking that will cause death and devastation to rain down on
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> me and the unlucky people who use my IAR.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Specifically what I do is:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 1) Export IAR, untar it.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 2) Faff with scripts.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 3) For each script that's changed, make a new UUID by taking the md5
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> sum of the contents, and sticking in some hyphens where they appear to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> belong.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 4) Rename the &lt;old UUID&gt;_script.lsl under assets/ to use the new UUID.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 4) Run sed on anything called &quot;.xml&quot; in the archive to change any
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> reference to the old UUID to the new UUID.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 5) Retar the IAR.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 6) Reimport.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> This is the script I run to do it:

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> This seems to be working OK, but can anyone think of anything bad
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that's going to happen?
