<PRE>When LL first opened up mesh to public beta, the viewers for it had a 
special folder just for mesh. At the time, meshes were treated something 
like a texture that you could apply to a prim. LL eventually decided 
that this was too messy (and opened a door to things like the horrible 
spectre of UUID mesh switching in scripts), and simply made meshes 
directly into objects just like any other prim.

So far as I know, any mesh uploaded and stored in the Meshes folder is 
no longer useful. I have no idea why you might have four folders of that 
name; forced to guess I'd name it in an artifact from a bug in mesh's 
earliest days.
