<PRE>Edmund, doing what you describe should be absolutely fine.  In fact, one of my design aims with laying out .oars/.iars 
in this way was to allow them to be inspected/constructed/altered by external tools, though it can still be a pretty 
tricky operation.

Changing the UUID is necessary since if an asset already exists with that ID it will be reused.  As long as you use a 
random UUID and replace all the existing references as you're doing then you should be fine.

Chris, this is the way it has been done for years.  There's no real errors to police - either an asset uuid already 
exists and so is reused or it does not and so is ignored.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 4) Rename the &lt;old UUID&gt;_script.lsl under assets/ to use the new UUID.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 4) Run sed on anything called &quot;.xml&quot; in the archive to change any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reference to the old UUID to the new UUID.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 5) Retar the IAR.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 6) Reimport.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This seems to be working OK, but can anyone think of anything bad
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that's going to happen?
