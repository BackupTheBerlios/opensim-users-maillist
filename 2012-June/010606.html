<PRE>Hi Edmund,

Thanks for your work on Sloodle. I loaded an IAR with the new system a 
couple of weeks ago to check it out and I ran into something similar. I 
resorted to diving into the IAR and trying to fix it. But, didn't get 
too far. I have been meaning to ask Justin about it, but have been 
pretty scattered lately. Hopefully he can give some insight - and 
hopefully I can have a little time to check these out again and offer 
some feedback. The last time I tried, I wasn't able to get all the parts 
to work, possibly for the reasons you are discussing.

Thanks

</I>&gt;<i> 4) Rename the&lt;old UUID&gt;_script.lsl under assets/ to use the new UUID.
</I>&gt;<i> 4) Run sed on anything called &quot;.xml&quot; in the archive to change any
</I>&gt;<i> reference to the old UUID to the new UUID.
</I>&gt;<i> 5) Retar the IAR.
</I>&gt;<i> 6) Reimport.

</I>&gt;<i> This is the script I run to do it:

</I>&gt;<i> This seems to be working OK, but can anyone think of anything bad
