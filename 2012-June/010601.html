<PRE>I have some situations where I want to export an object as an IAR,
faff with the LSL code, and reimport it.

This is working fine, except that sometimes the UUIDs of the scripts
I've faffed with already exist in OpenSim, resulting in the new
version not being imported.
(I'm pretty sure that's what's happening - I've tried clearing the
viewer cache and deleting stuff under bin/ScriptEngines and so forth.)

To avoid this, I want to change the UUIDs of the scripts I've faffed
with in my IAR every time I make a change to their content. I've tried
this and it seems to work, but I as I don't understand the internals
of this stuff I just wanted to check if there's some important thing
I'm overlooking that will cause death and devastation to rain down on
me and the unlucky people who use my IAR.

Specifically what I do is:
1) Export IAR, untar it.
2) Faff with scripts.
3) For each script that's changed, make a new UUID by taking the md5
sum of the contents, and sticking in some hyphens where they appear to
belong.
4) Rename the &lt;old UUID&gt;_script.lsl under assets/ to use the new UUID.
4) Run sed on anything called &quot;.xml&quot; in the archive to change any
reference to the old UUID to the new UUID.
5) Retar the IAR.
6) Reimport.

This is the script I run to do it:

This seems to be working OK, but can anyone think of anything bad
that's going to happen?
