<PRE>osgrid always runs from a point on the development branch show it will always be showing the next default release number 
(currently 0.7.4).

There are a lot of bug fixes since 0.7.3.1.  Personally, I'm hoping to get the ball rolling on the new release sometime 
at the end of July and into August.

I can't recall what features have been added since 0.7.3.1, though off the top of my head one is the ability to add 
script functions through region modules rather than having to patch OpenSimulator itself.  Another feature I'm hoping to 
get in is the ability to do more than one attachment on a single attach point.  Working code for this is actually in the 
multiple-attachments branch but it needs more testing with v1 viewers and thought about the data format and how it 
interacts with existing data.
