<PRE>I have made a refinement in commit 972b0b5 to still warn if no explicit language was set.  I believe the false positives 
will be lower here, since lines are less likely to end with colons for completely separate reasons.

This is about balancing the known false positives against any use of this alternative engine specification facility. 
This problem (false positives because of : in the first line) has come up a lot in the past as well as now.  On the 
other hand. are you (or anybody else on this list) aware of any current cases of people using this ability to specify a 
different script engine?  I'm not currently aware of any.

The only other current script engine implementations I'm aware of are apart from XEngine are DNE (long discarded from 
core), ForthMinus (abandoned by Alondira over 4 years ago), some other DNE derived engine that was long abandoned and 
your own proprietary engine.  I don't count engines running on forked codebases since they have moved away from 
OpenSimulator compatibility.

To be honest, I think this is an over-specified feature that was only brought in originally to avoid making a decision 
about OpenSimulator's script engine.  I find it hard to believe that anyone would want to deal with the complexity of 
running some scripts in one engine and other scripts in another in the same simulator, just for some theoretical 
performance advantage.  I rather doubt you're running 2 engines for the same language since that would be a nightmare to 
explain to users (happy to be corrected on this point).

Really, I think we should adopt a better way of specifying the script language/engine than looking for a : than be stuck 
with this issue forever.
