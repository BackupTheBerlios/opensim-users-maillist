<PRE>Trying to run phpMyAdmin with SoaS 0.7.3 in Win7, and cannot connect.

I had about a year ago (with a previous version of SoaS on WinXP)
installed phpMyAdmin along with SoaS, as per
<A HREF="http://www.chsoftware.net/en/mowes/mowesmixer/mowesmixer.htm?step=2">http://www.chsoftware.net/en/mowes/mowesmixer/mowesmixer.htm?step=2</A>
and it worked as advertised. Then one day it just quit working for no
obvious reason. I run SoaS and go to localhost on my browser and get
the error (on Firefox):
&quot;Firefox can't establish a connection to the server at localhost.&quot;
(or on Chromium):
&quot;Chromium's connection attempt to localhost was rejected. The website
may be down or your network may not be properly configured.&quot;

To me, this would seem to imply that Mowe's Apache server isn't
running, however I have no problem logging in to SoaS via Imprudence,
so clearly the server is fine.

Have reinstalled SoaS, tried more recent versions, reinstalled
phpMyAdmin, all to no avail. I've since even moved to Win7 &amp; installed
a fresh download of SoaS and phpMyAdmin, and yet I am still running
into the same exact issue! I just watched over my partner's shoulder
as she installed phpMyAdmin onto her SoaS and it worked without a
hitch, so I know it's not something I'm doing wrong (and Mowes doesn't
seem to have any trouble finding &amp; installing the phpMyAdmin package).

I use Privoxy, but this wasn't an issue when phpMyAdmin was working.
When I try to run phpMyAdmin without Privoxy, it still doesn't work. I
don't use a firewall on my PC (not even Windows firewall), relying on
the modem firewall. It's been the same modem all along so that doesn't
seem likely. I've tried disabling all Firefox plugins when using
Firefox, but again this had no effect.

Anyone else having this problem? Any suggestions on something I might
try? Ready to pull my hair out here!
