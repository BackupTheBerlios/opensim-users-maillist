<PRE>Well, I think in that case the asset service was not rewriting the asset anyway if the UUID already existed - that check 
was made at the simulator end.

However,

(a) That's not necessarily true of all service implmentations

and

(b) It appears to be more efficient to check the asset metadata first rather than always bung asset data over to the 
service and let it sort things out.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Chris, this is the way it has been done for years.  There's no real errors to police - either an asset uuid already

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> sum of the contents, and sticking in some hyphens where they appear to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> belong.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 4) Rename the &lt;old UUID&gt;_script.lsl under assets/ to use the new UUID.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 4) Run sed on anything called &quot;.xml&quot; in the archive to change any
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> reference to the old UUID to the new UUID.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 5) Retar the IAR.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 6) Reimport.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> This seems to be working OK, but can anyone think of anything bad
