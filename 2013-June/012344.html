Propagating scripts to objects is accomplished the same way in OpenSim as
it is in Second Life,
described in llRemoteLoadScriptPin&lt;<A HREF="http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/LlRemoteLoadScriptPin">http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/LlRemoteLoadScriptPin</A>&gt;.
For objects that need regular updates, I just assign a unique
Script Pin to each type of object and include a listen on a unique channel
in the scripts that need to be updated.
Processing the update then is as easy as dropping a master object with all
the new inventory items, and an update script.
The master object does a regionsay on the assigned channel, and every
object that responds gets the inventory updated with the current contents
of the master object  including the new scripts.  Once the basic script is
in place  you can update it to provide lists of region objects, or an
update history you can compare to find objects that have gone &quot;off&quot;.

Eventually  you will probably discover that it is easier to break the
update functions out of the item scripts and use a generic update script in
addition to the objects functional script... 2 scripts per object    1 for
update comms and the other to be updated...

The other use case you need to make exceptions for is attached objects.
You cannot update someones else object with this process while the object
is attached.  For HUD devices  one rarely wants to update them all while
being worn anyway.   The obvious solution is to have folks enter a location
where an updater is , place the attached object in the ground/table   and
run an update with commands  &quot;whispered&quot; to limit the effective distance of
the broadcast... ( i.e.  only update the objects sitting on the &quot;update&quot;
table)

This design has been working for me over 2 years now  and I regularly do
updates to objects with 10-150 copies in the current region with a very
very small error rate.   I also use the update option to re-install and
re-start objects that get shut down/confused when regions fail in odd
ways...    Its way easier to click an update button than to find and
manually script reset dozens or hundreds of items
