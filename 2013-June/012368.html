<PRE>Thanks for the extra information now flowing.  And thanks for that 
pointer to the earlier discussion on the very same point Fleep.

I really think the time is right to get this sorted out ... we have 
the ears of the core developers in some TPVs and some now are looking 
seriously at the OpenSim issues with the opportunity now created by 
having to have an OpenSim variant of every active viewer to exclude 
the havok licenced code.

There is no need to stop odd URL variants being supported in viewers 
that already can handle them - like the double colon format that 
emerged at one time...  but we need to go forward into a future with 
many types of virtual world platform connected by standards compliant 
systems in future - not just focus on OpenSim to OpenSim 
grids).  That's the appeal of a non-platform specific URI protocol 
prefix like <A HREF="hop://">hop://</A>

And perhaps its a matter of adopting a single style and then going 
with that to fix (or at the very last radically simply and improve 
connectivity).

So, a proposal is as follows... that inter-grid valid teleport 
indications are characterised by a standard form as follows:

<A HREF="hop://gridname:port/regionname/x/y/z/">hop://gridname:port/regionname/x/y/z/</A>

Relevant parts ought to be able to be left out if that makes sense... 
but not at the expense of making platform or region size assumptions. 
the landing places ought to be left unspecified if the <A HREF="hop://">hop://</A> is 
ambiguous rather than bundling in such assumptions to  the protocol 
specification, though any specific implementation could use platform 
knowledge of course.

default gridname:port uit to imply the address is onky valud on the 
local grid.  But i the gridname:port is present it should also work 
even if its used on that grid (this is not the case in the present 
handling of <A HREF="hop://">hop://</A> in some viewers).


default port is the HTTP default port 80 (not a platform specific port)

x,y/z in units of a metre, decimal point allowed.

Final / optional

Melanie makes a very good point about how to bring in SSL grid login 
URIs.  There may be a good way to do this for those familiar with 
designing such protocol handlers and the syntax of the URIs...  but a 
simple scheme would be for the protocol handlers in viewers to try 
<A HREF="http://gridname">http://gridname</A> and if that fails then fakll back to try 
<A HREF="https://gridname">https://gridname</A>  before reporting failure.  Redeemer its only a 
HANDLER.. so need not fully reflect the underlying calls tried or made.

</PRE>
