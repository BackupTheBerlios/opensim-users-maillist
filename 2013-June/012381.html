<PRE>With apologies for cross posting...

Registration for the 1st Annual OpenSimulator Community Conference 2013 is
now open!

The Overte Foundation &lt;<A HREF="http://www.overte.org/">http://www.overte.org/</A>&gt; and
AvaCon&lt;<A HREF="http://www.avacon.org/blog/">http://www.avacon.org/blog/</A>&gt;are pleased to announce that
registration is now open for the first annual OpenSimulator
Community Conference 2013 &lt;<A HREF="http://conference.opensimulator.org">http://conference.opensimulator.org</A>&gt; (
<A HREF="http://conference.opensimulator.org">http://conference.opensimulator.org</A>).  The virtual conference will take
place entirely online on the OpenSimulator Conference Center grid on
September 7 &#8211; 8, 2013.  The OpenSimulator Community Conference will be a
celebration of the platform and of the large and varied community using and
co-creating it.  It will feature two days of keynote speakers,
presentations and panels on different topics, and an expo area to showcase
community activities and projects.

Due to the &#8220;alpha&#8221; nature of the OpenSimulator software, this conference is
an experiment in capacity testing for OpenSimulator in addition to being a
community event.  Therefore, tickets to the conference will be free but
limited in number.  We hope to be able to accommodate over 200 users in
total, a figure which includes speakers, sponsors and staff .  Since seats
are limited, registration will open on a first-come-first-served basis until
the maximum number of virtual conference center tickets is reached.  At
that point, community members will still be able to register for the live
streamed version of the conference that will be available via UStream.
 This will also be free.  The expo area will not be ticketed and so can be
accessed by any avatar, subject to constraints on the number of avatars
that the exhibition regions can hold at any particular time.

Sponsors, speakers, staff members, and volunteers should not register for a
regular Attendee ticket.  Instead, please use the promo code provided to
you.  See the conference website to find out more information about
becoming a sponsor, speaker, or joining the conference planning team!

ORGANIZATION INFORMATION:

OpenSimulator is an open-source platform that supports the creation of
collaborative, immersive, distributed and social 3D virtual environments
over the Internet. Started in 2007 and developed by individuals and
organizations large and small, it has become a versatile system with which
anyone can experiment.  OpenSimulator software is now the basis for many
&#8220;grids&#8221; of varying sizes and purposes.  <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org">http://opensimulator.org</A>

The Overte Foundation is a non-profit organization that manages
contribution agreements for the OpenSimulator project.  In the future, it
will also act to promote and support both OpenSimulator and the wider
open-source 3D virtual environment ecosystem.  <A HREF="http://www.overte.org/">http://www.overte.org/</A>
