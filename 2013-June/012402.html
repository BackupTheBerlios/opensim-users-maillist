OpenSimulator Community Conference Invites Speakers, Presentations, and
Research Papers
-=======-

The OpenSimulator Community Conference is seeking speakers, presentations,
and research papers for the inaugural annual conference event, scheduled
for September 7 - 8, 2013.  The conference will take place entirely within
an OpenSimulator virtual world designed specifically for the event, and
will feature six topic &#8220;tracks&#8221; to showcase community activities and
projects.

The Arts &amp; Creativity track will celebrate the diversity of artistic and
creative endeavors on OpenSimulator grids. This can include large scale
immersive art installations, ballet, theatre, performance art, machinima,
literary arts, clothing designs, virtual fashions, architecture, music
performances and other cultural expressions.

The Business &amp; Enterprise track will feature sessions that cover a broad
range of uses related to doing business in and with OpenSimulator,
including grid hosts, third party developers, private entrepreneurs,
in-world and enterprise businesses, as well as corporations and
organizations using OpenSimulator for marketing, fundraising, product
research, focus groups, and more.

The Developers &amp; Open Source track covers topics of interest to
OpenSimulator developers, including developers of third-party modules,
viewer developers, applications that run in and along side OpenSimulator,
Hypergrid systems developers, as well as the more technical details of
content creation including 3D modeling, mesh, physics, NPCs, and emerging
technology tools that help make OpenSimulator tick.

The Education Track will feature sessions that cover a broad range of uses
related to teaching and learning in and with OpenSimulator, as well as how
schools, colleges, and universities are using OpenSimulator in their
day-to-day work, from designing virtual campuses and classrooms, to
integration with other campus systems, marketing and outreach, and much
more.

The Research Track will explore the ways in which OpenSimulator has become
a laboratory for research in a wide range of areas, from computer science
and engineering to ethnography and economics.

The Social &amp; Communities track will explore all the ways in which
OpenSimulator offers communities for nearly every interest, from role
playing groups to science fiction communities, to virtual towns and
interest groups, historical explorations, religious and spiritual
communities, book clubs, and so much more. This track will feature sessions
that focus on sharing about and improving the social experience and overall
community of OpenSimulator users.

Proposal submissions are due on July 1, 2013.  To submit a proposal or for

ORGANIZATION INFORMATION

-=======-

OpenSimulator is an open-source platform that supports the creation of
collaborative, immersive, distributed and social 3D virtual environments
over the Internet. Started in 2007 and developed by individuals and
organizations large and small, it has become a versatile system with which
anyone can experiment.  OpenSimulator software is now the basis for many
&#8220;grids&#8221; of varying sizes and purposes.  <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org">http://opensimulator.org</A>

The Overte Foundation is a non-profit organization that manages
contribution agreements for the OpenSimulator project.  In the future, it
will also act to promote and support both OpenSimulator and the wider
open-source 3D virtual environment ecosystem.  <A HREF="http://www.overte.org/">http://www.overte.org/</A>

AvaCon, Inc. is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to promoting
the growth, enhancement, and development of the metaverse, virtual worlds,
augmented reality, and 3D immersive and virtual spaces. We hold conventions
and meetings to promote educational and scientific inquiry into these
spaces, and to support organized fan activities, including performances,
lectures, art, music, machinima, and much more. Our primary goal is to
connect and support the diverse communities and practitioners involved in
co-creating and using virtual worlds, and to educate the public and our
constituents about the emerging ecosystem of technologies broadly known as
the metaverse.  <A HREF="http://avacon.org">http://avacon.org</A>
