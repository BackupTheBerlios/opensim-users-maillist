<PRE>I currently have a 4 sim megaregion set-up using D2.  I would like to add a
single, normal region sandbox.  I added the appropriate info to
/bin/Regions/RegionConfig.ini and the region shows up when I teleport to it,
but I'm stuck at &lt;0,0,21&gt; and don't seem to be able to move from that spot
(other than flying straight up).  If I fly or run as hard as I can, or
right-click the ground and choose 'Sit here', I can get a few meters out,
but eventually I get pushed back to &lt;0,0,21&gt;.

Right-clicking the ground and choosing 'Go here' gives an error in the
console (typo included!):
13:46:54 - [LLCLIENTVIEW]: Exeception when handling generic message Region
with id 3618823b-86de-4e16-9c23-8b86160826fc not found at
OpenSim.Region.RegionCombinerModule.RegionCombinerModule.GetSizeOfMegaregion(UUID
regionId)

Is it not possible to have both megaregions and normal regions?  The error
makes it sound like it's attempting to treat this single region like a
megaregion and failing.  Is there some work around?

-----

If anyone is curious, here's what else happened to me while I was testing
this out.  I attempted to teleport home using ctrl+shift+h and was plummeted
into the depths of the ocean with the following console messages:

13:51:23 - [ENTITY TRANSFER MODULE]: Request to teleport Jessica Pixel
aaa658c2-6fd2-4845-a251-e893703fd80a home
13:51:23 - [HG ENTITY TRANSFER MODULE]: User is local
13:51:23 - [ENTITY TRANSFER MODULE]: Request to teleport Jessica Pixel
aaa658c2-6fd2-4845-a251-e893703fd80a home
13:51:23 - [ENTITY TRANSFER MODULE]: Home region of Jessica Pixel is
PixelPlanetSW (7662-7557)
13:51:23 - [ENTITY TRANSFER MODULE]: Teleport for Jessica Pixel to
&lt;937601.2, 910710.6, 41.49851&gt; within Sandbox
13:51:23 - [ENTITY TRANSFER STATE MACHINE]: Agent
aaa658c2-6fd2-4845-a251-e893703fd80a cleared from transit in Sandbox

Now, I'm currently sinking into the ocean at about -100 meters a second!  I
tried to fly after I reached around &lt;0,0,-5000&gt; and I was teleported to
&lt;0,0,4&gt;, still within the sandbox region with this console message:

13:55:02 - [ENTITY TRANSFER MODULE]: Teleport for Jessica Pixel to &lt;-0.0625,
-0.0625, 6.688429E+09&gt; within Sandbox
13:55:02 - [ENTITY TRANSFER STATE MACHINE]: Agent
aaa658c2-6fd2-4845-a251-e893703fd80a cleared from transit in Sandbox

That's a really big number!  From there, I could fly up until I popped up
from under the ground, but I still can't move forward.  I opened my map and
typed in the name of my root region, and was still sent to the bottom of the
ocean.  I logged out of my viewer and logged back in to my home and I was
delivered there, but without avatar textures (attachments were fine and
textured).  However, the other three regions in the megaregion had no
terrain, just ocean and lots of objects hovering above the water.

So, I logged out, shutdown OpenSim and removed the sandbox region info from
RegionConfig.ini.  After starting OpenSim back up, everything was back to
normal.
