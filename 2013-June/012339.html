<PRE>Hello
I was a surprised to see that I could animate an NPC without using the
osNpcPlayAnimation OSSL command.
For e.g. if you create a prim and set it to animate an avatar who sits
on it, then you could use something like

    run_time_permissions(integer perm)
    {
        if (perm &amp; PERMISSION_TRIGGER_ANIMATION)
        {
                animation=llGetInventoryName(INVENTORY_ANIMATION,0);
                llStartAnimation(animation);
        }
    }

that gets triggered when sitting is detected.

However, if you get an NPC to sit on the same prim, you would not
expect it to animate as well because the osNpcPlayAnimation command is
not there. It's not that I do not like it, it's just that I do not
understand it. And I am wondering if this is a bug. if this is fixed,
then I may have to debug my scripts for all my seats at a later stage.
Since my application deals with hundreds of such situations, that
would be hard work in the future ... because as we well know updating
code for complex stuff in opensim is so inefficient because there are
no way to propagate changes for scripts that are used often in
different objects.

on a side note, how does one efficiently update scripts for many
objects that use them at once. It would be great if each script
element in every prim is actually a pointer to some script in
inventory, so that when we change the script in the inventory, then
all scripts would know about the change. Is this something way too
hard to implement?
