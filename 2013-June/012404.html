<PRE>One or two aspects of the <A HREF="hop://">hop://</A> URI handling has now improved in 
Firestorm 4.4.1 which was released yesterday.. and within a grid 
return <A HREF="hop://">hop://</A> addresses now work (previously they had a bug whereby 
the viewer thought the target destination was at the 0,0 point on the 
map).  Firestorm is now also register with the operating system (in 
Windows anyway) as a URI helper for the <A HREF="hop://">hop://</A> protocol.  This could 
mean you can have separate viewers registered to launch or be fed the 
<A HREF="hop://">hop://</A> for OpenSim and <A HREF="secondlife://">secondlife://</A> for second Life without using 
the latter for different grids.  As in 4.4.0, using a <A HREF="hop://">hop://</A> for a 
grid  you have not visited before will lead to it automatically being 
added to the Viewer OpenSim grid list and its [GridInfo] being 
retrieved, the region/x/y/z preselected in the viewer log in 
screen.  Also now if you try a <A HREF="hop://">hop://</A> when logged into second Life in 
the viewer it gives a nice message explaining you cannot move from 
second life to other grids. All very positive and getting closer to 
this begin a much easier methods for grid hopping.

BUT... unfortunately... in my tests at least... some elements that 
worked fine before in 4.4.0 now do not work.  Perhaps the fix to 
handle local hopping between regions on the same grid has broken some 
other elements.  In fact in my tests today I can no longer move 
between grids at all, with the map or links in chat. If so that is a 
serious bug (show stopper).

Can someone else test and confirm if I am right, or if I just missed 
something?  I set up a test page with some sample <A HREF="hop://">hop://</A> URIs to move 
between, all of which OUGHT to work in any order and the source 
region <A HREF="hop://">hop://</A> URI printed out by the viewer in local chat should be 
clickable whichever grid you are on too.

A Firestorm JIRA entry about this has some comments from me to report 
this to the Firestorm team... which I will change if we can resolve 
this on the OpenSim user side.  Thanks, Ai
