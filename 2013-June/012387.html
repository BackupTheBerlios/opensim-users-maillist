</I>Based on your description I'd say you could use the content in a VW so 
long as its not transferred to another user.   So people coming to your 
world can view it but you cant give away or sell the content.

Protected and OpenSim is a bit of a sketchy area.  The viewer needs the 
assets to render them.  But the formats aren't standard so your probably 
OK.    Someone would have to purposely try and hack the asset and that's 
not easily controllable by you.

This is a personal decision but that's how I'd interpret things based on 
your description.
