Ok.

I configured the cache with Cenome in my OpenSim. Apparently some things are
best that before.
I dont use the conventionals clients how Hippo or SL. My client is a
bot(pcambot).
Is a dream try to connect around 50 or 60 users with this hardware?

How many users I get to connect about?

best regards
Oliver

---------------------------------------------

You may want to use flotsum as it will not use RAM and is probably a better
choice with that many users.
If your launching the bots or clients on the same box as your running
opensimulator on then that may be where all your ram went 1t also can lead
to sad but amusing problems. Normaly you shouldent run clients on the same
computer as the sim host is on.
In the flotsom config you will also NOT want RAM option and just use the HD
caching only.
Your system seem's quite able to handle that many users, we have had many on
with a less powerfull server and had no big problems.
