<PRE>Hi, I am having a little bit of trouble with people trying to log into 
my OS server from outside my network. I can log into it fine from any 
computer on my LAN but when someone tries to access it from WAN they get 
as far as the region handshake and it dies on them.

Here is the Regions.ini setup

[Monte Cristo]
RegionUUID = bf4a1f26-f6f2-4871-bbf5-3620e8a39872
Location = 1000,1000
InternalAddress = 0.0.0.0
InternalPort = 9000
AllowAlternatePorts = False
ExternalHostName = 70.XXX.XXX.200 (actual full address is in the ini 
file, just middle two octets hidden here for privacy)
MasterAvatarFirstName = Chris
MasterAvatarLastName = Kennedy
MasterAvatarSandboxPassword = lolpassword


This works perfectly fine when I run OpenSim from my Linux box (I can 
log in and others can login outside my LAN just fine), but using this 
same setup on my Windows computer it hangs at region handshake for 
people outside my LAN (I can log in fine and all works fine as long as 
it is a computer within my LAN). There is no apparent difference in 
OpenSim setup except for the fact that it is on Windows instead of 
Linux, and a different LAN IP address.

I have made sure to forward the OpenSim ports to the appropriate LAN IPs 
on my router for both my Linux and Windows system. My database 
connectors in OpenSim.ini are correct, MySQL has the database and 
database user with privileges set to the opensim database. My firewall 
is set to allow OpenSim on all ports (even tried disabling my firewall 
completely). I've checked my hosts file and it is redirecting localhost 
to 127.0.0.1 if that is useful info...

I am really at a loss on this... Any insight on this would be much 
appreciated!

</PRE>
