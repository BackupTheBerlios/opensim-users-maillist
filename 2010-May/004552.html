why yah read the catch22 of it, theres a more gand thought. Lets say your
work is art. you maynot get payed for it but its that good that ppl copy it.
Thay do that because your art is the best and thay cant do it them selps. It
is more about fame in that case. No one can do better than you and OS has
locks now that keep the orgial maker knowen. I make alot of stuff and in my
weird way, of its stole or other wise just kicks ass because in ppls eyes
its that good!
I make alot and in away that ppl love. Mabey ppl take stuff because your
work is that good. Thay prob will call yah you up and want yah todo more
then you get payed. (thay do for me anyway).
I guess is a matter of who you serve. As long as my name is on what i make
im fine :)
If what i make is that good ppl need to steal it well it lives passed me in
a grander theam of thought.
id rather see ppl happy and know its used and wanted. a few $ is allways
nice too :)

tnx
