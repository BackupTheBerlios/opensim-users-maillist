<PRE>Yes, I do have both my Windows and Linux box set to static IP 
(192.168.1.100 and 192.168.1.122 respectively).

As far as the port range forwarding settings go, I don't run OpenSim on 
both computers at the same time (it's either one or the other) and I 
disable whichever one that I am not currently using in my Port Range 
Forwarding settings in the router setup via the enable checkbox.

I have tried going as far as deleting all my port forward and port range 
forward settings, leaving just the one for OpenSim for my Windows 
computer with no luck there either.

I am not sure why it works perfectly fine on my Linux computer and not 
Windows (disabled my firewall and made sure the windows firewall is off. 
Also disabled antivirus as it has network sheilds) . This is a real head 
scratcher for me. I can run other network services on the same Windows 
box such as an HTTP server and Unreal Tournament server just fine and 
other people can connect to them, just OpenSim is not liking it lol...
