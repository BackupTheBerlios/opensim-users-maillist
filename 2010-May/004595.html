A bit more
Opensim has no way to contoll what content sl leaks. Its not fair to just
point out OSG or any opensim op. 
If you really want to make a case then ask the lab how it got out to start
with!
Its not fair to poke fingers at Opensimulator for somone elses oops!

You works leaked out i guess. but were not the ones to get mad at!

Thay got all the bucks, were just after them .. 
Anyway i feel for yah but really your barking in the wrong place. 
No one i know took anything that wasent there own. some others may have, who
knows?
How ever it happened the lab was 1st and if your stuff got out then why
todo?
If the lab way back handent allowed then this is not a problem now to os.

I just dont think it fair to blame OSG , the blame isant with them our our
grid.

tnx
