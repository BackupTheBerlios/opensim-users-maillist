<PRE>I remember once looking into the way OpenSimulator handles it's INI files.
This was quite a while ago so I'm sorta fuzzy on it. But the assembly it
uses, Nini, has both low-level functions for manipulating an INI, and
higher-level wrappers that perform a lot of important tasks very easily and
with a minimum of code. IIRC, OpenSim uses the latter almost exclusively,
and those wrappers aren't very good at retaining human readable files with
comments. There's also a few bugs in Nini, and I think that the quotes
getting stripped might be one of those.

Long story short, fixing this would be best handled with upstream patches to
Nini, which itself hasn't seen a new release in 4 years now. This could
conceivably also be fixed by using the lower-level functions that Nini
offers, but this would be a non-trivial piece of work for a developer, and
result in significantly more code with a few ugly bits.

Could also replace Nini too, I 'spose, but I'm not immediately aware of an
adequate cross platform solution that would suffice.

Anyhoo, I'd definitely regard the console config commands as currently
unsupported and b0rked. A mantis couldn't hurt, if one doesn't already
exist.
