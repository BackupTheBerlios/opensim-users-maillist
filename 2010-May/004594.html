I took this a bit futher and made shure your exaples are know should thay see
it. We made replacemnts and wount argue how it thay got it, there just as
good. I made it really clear on our grid that if your work is seen , to
offer a rplacemnt and not to go in to how thay got it. 
As a grid we cant know whos right or wrong, I know you from way back in sl
and i know your who yah say.

So in this case we replace any of that with our own rather than go down a
road we cant do.

What helps is like you did though, say what it is and respncble grid ops are
aware. 

If i dident know you from way back lil, this wount work.

We have verry good ppl to and can make our own but where something comes
from theres no way to say.

Anyway as far as i know your works are now purged and the rare few we
replaced.

i think more creators should let OS grid ops know if thay feel its not
right.

tnx
