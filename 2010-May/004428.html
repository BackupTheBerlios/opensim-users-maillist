<PRE>I don't know the particulars of your situation, and that's besides the 
point. The main point, stated here several times, is that the database 
schema has changed considerably in 0.7; the tools for user registration 
that work pre-0.7 will not work in 0.7. Specifically for user accounts, 
pre-0.7 uses the table users, while 0.7 uses the new table useraccounts.
You will need to change your tool to use the new tables; or use a new 
user registration app altogether.

Info about registration apps not working:

</I>&gt;<i> All the user account data that uses .69 type looks consistant with all the

</I>&gt;<i> Making new accounts in .69 works fine but dont show up in .7. All .68

</I>&gt;<i> Tnx again
