Would be the lan ip of the computer your running opensim on. 
Gateway ip.. Opensimulator dosent care about , because you allready defind
that in your normal network settings.


You also should set your network settings the computer uses to a FIXED lan
ip # rather than a DHCP issued one. You want that a constant computer lan ip
# for Opensimulator in this case.

Your router is doing the work mostly so you dont want your computer to also
be too smart at the same time.
