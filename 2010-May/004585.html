Ok well, i still think that dual port range use looks odd to me, will assume
that its not that.
If you allready have a working linux opensim and not a working win, the only
real diff is the lan ip # as far as settings go, there arnt realy any other
diffs if your doing what i think.
Its possable and i know this happens that the router dosent allways reset
when it thinks it has. You may want to un-plug your router's power then back
in, making shure only the portrange you have enabled is point to the right
box and re-try. 
DMZ should be off btw.
Next would be loop back may be differnt on win than on *nix but i doubt it.

If that dosent set it right, you want to make shure that the port is
reacable, sometimes win can fool yah.
