<PRE>I just installed the newest release of this on OSGRID's site.  It all 
starts up well but I do get one small issue.  Only a few textures didn't 
load up and I received a few errors on the console. The ones I found 
where few, so I only had to reupload the textures that where missing.  
But now each time I restart the standalone opensim, I get this...

21:07:20 - [UUID GATHERER]: Failed to get part - 
System.NullReferenceException:
Object reference not set to an instance of an object.
21:07:20 - [UUID GATHERER]: Texture entry length for prim was 0 (min is 46)

Is there anything I can do about this?

on another subject, Seems I did do something wrong when I first set up.  
Other people are using windows 7 64 bit and don't mention a problem.  I 
had to use other ports besides those given as default for opensim.  
Because my system was already using port 9000 and several after that.  
So I started with port 9030.  All runs fine for now.

The problems I see coming my way will be if I run my Standalone in Grid 
mode.  I seem to be jumping around, it is late here.  But in my attempt 
to try to run groups one of the errors result in trying to find the user 
database.  but I am not running using the UGIAN, thinking that is what 
it is, win 7 64 is also telling me it used port 8002 and some other 
ports near that for something internal to win7.  Since as of yet I don't 
see a way to configure the UGIAN to run on other ports, how are you 
doing it?

Thanks for the patients with me.  I have been awake for hours, I am 
lucky to make much sense at all at this moment.
