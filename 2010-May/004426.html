<PRE>
Ty, its the same tool that has allways been used for over a year and a 1/2
now and continues to work fine in .69 post and pre-fixes for all reg users
currently. What we couldent figuer out is why only 10 do not show up in .7+
but the orgianal 55 do useing the same tool. The mysql DB is an exact clone
thats run on its own instance. I would have expected .7+ to use them all not
just some of them or at least see that it needed to migrate the additional
accounts as it did with the older 55 accounts.
What DB is actualy going tobe used for accounts? And how do i take the
additional 10 and fix them ?. At somepoint this will need tobe done as there
active accounts.
The tool its selph dosent point to the clone beta grid we run in par. with
our .69 (.7 is only using what data there allready is), not adding to it. We
do know a new tool will have tobe made for .7 but never got that far yet.
Its only intened to use current user's data that allready exists and works
in .69 but only some work in .7 (pre .69 ones). Mostly were tying to
evaluate what changes we will need to make when the time comes and what to
do with the 10 that arnt working that were created in .69 but not in .68+
(the problem 10).
All the user account data that uses .69 type looks consistant with all the
others.
Making new accounts in .69 works fine but dont show up in .7. All .68
accounts do show up as active in all 3.
Tnx again
