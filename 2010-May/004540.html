<PRE>For what it's worth:

I am probably one of those referred to as 'various &quot;authorities&quot;'.

While I do not speak for everyone (no one does in an opensource project), I
can attempt relate the official position of the largest of the open grids
(the only open grid?) based on opensimulator: OSGrid. Others may correct me,
or support me, or perhaps add to what I state, I encourage this; our
position is not one of extremity or hysteria, and as I say, though I am in
something of a position of authority at OSGrid, I am anything but the final
word.

Basically, we do not tolerate 'ripping content', where ripping is literal
theft. However, we do require proof of guilt, as opposed to proof of
innocence; and our options with respect to responding to a circumstance
wherein someone has demonstrably committed a theft of content are largely
limited to removal of the content from our asset servers.

When I say proof, I do not mean that the complainant shows up with identical
content to the alleged thief and asserts guilt. By proof I mean that said
content has to be proven unique and originally created or licensed by the
complainant. Further, the complainant must observe the following procedures
and provide the following related documentation:

         - the complainant has to have such proof of ownership or licensing
as will stand up to scrutiny in a court of law
         - the complainant must be willing to file appropriate DMCA takedown
paperwork and go on record as the owner of the content or a valid license
thereto
         - the complainant must be willing to follow through on the legal
process once a takedown order has been issued to the alleged content thief

We at OSGrid have little interest in policing the several thousand
semi-anonymous region operators of the regions on OSGrid; nor do we have a
legal obligation to do so, any more than Vint Cerf has an obligation to
police the world wide web. The responsibility for prosecuting a legal case
of content theft lies with the offended party, and while we will do anything
we are able to do in the interest of of supporting a legitimate claim
(strictly in the interest of proper legal action), slander, defamation, or
other persecution of an alleged offender will not be tolerated.

This should not be interpreted as a license to steal by the operators of
OSGrid. It is, however, notice that we will not become involved in petty,
do-it-yourself justice attempts or similar vigilantism. Further, it is
intended to set at ease those who wish to offer free content to the
residents of our grid.

In this interest, as such a content creator or someone who has an interest
in disseminating such content, you are encouraged to provide proper
documentation of the content with respect to your role in creating or
disseminating such content *with the content at the time of delivery*, along
with a commonly accepted license stating how and under what conditions it
may be used.

As with the real world, you are responsible for your own actions and
perforce it behooves you to protect yourself in such ways as you are able.

I salute those of you for your contribution of content made freely available
to all, and I encourage everyone concerned to avoid stooping to such base
insinuations as precipitated this response.

If in doubt, ask; we didn't participate in the creation of open source
software (and an open access grid based upon it), in order to entrap or
ensnare anyone; indeed, openness and availability of content are the
hallmarks of our organization and community. This does not, however, obviate
the need to behave responsibly with respect to property.

Thanks and kindest regards
