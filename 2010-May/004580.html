<PRE>Ah alright, I will give that a try.

I am using a router (Linksys WRT54G using DD-WRT custom firmware if it 
helps). My OpenSim setup is in standalone mode, hypergrid is off , not 
using mega regions , and not connected to a larger grid such as OSGrid.

When you say try a LAN IP such as 192.168.1.5; are you referring to the 
gateway address (i.e. the router's ip) or the LAN IP address of the 
computer I have OpenSim running on?

Thank you for your help :)
