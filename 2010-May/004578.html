[Monte Cristo]
RegionUUID = bf4a1f26-f6f2-4871-bbf5-3620e8a39872
Location = 1000,1000
InternalAddress = 0.0.0.0
InternalPort = 9000
AllowAlternatePorts = False
ExternalHostName = 70.XXX.XXX.200 (actual full address is in the ini 
file, just middle two octets hidden here for privacy)
MasterAvatarFirstName = Chris
MasterAvatarLastName = Kennedy
MasterAvatarSandboxPassword = lolpassword

You may want to try a lan ip # like ExternalHostName = 10.0.0.5  or
192.168.1.5  depending on the lan ip of the box.

Its hard to tell what mode your running opensim in though.
The rest of your ini looks ok.
If you use a LAN ip it req you use port fwd in your router so external
clients will  be sent to the proper box and port. In that case the router
deals with your actual web ip# and your LAN region server dosent have to.
If you dont have a router then it would be ether the fixed ip as you have it
or you can use a fqdn in its place. Sometimes isp's keep changing your web
ip on you. If thats the case then you want to use a fqdn and an ip tracking
client like bynDNS or others.
With out knowing more of what you have set up its hard to say. It can get a
bit complex in knowing what to tell you.
-----------------
Adding a note: If your not using a router you also want to change
InternalAddress = 0.0.0.0  to your lan IP so it knows what to listen on.
That asumes you have a FIX web ip# and no router.
