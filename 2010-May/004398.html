<PRE>I'm fairly confident that we don't have a network or DNS issue; we're on a large university network with no other signs of network problems.  The fact that it complains about trying to connect to 127.0.0.1 makes me think it has to be a problem with one of the services not correctly communicating with the others.

This might be a showstopper for us, if people can't consistently and reliably log in...

&gt;<i> I seem to be having a strange problem recently, with people not being able to log in to my sim.  The problems seem random as far as I can tell, and I can be logged into the sim while others are getting the login problems.  Sometimes it takes 20+ attempts before login is successful.  Once logged in, everything works correctly.  From the logs, it seems as if the services can't communicate with each other...

Jason, this sound like some issues we have been exploring for a while (since 0.6.5 in fact) and that are present in 0.6.6 through 0.6.8 post fixed (current stable version) and also still show in 0..6.9 RC1.  We get the same sorts of messages and behaviors since 0.6.5 that you do with the messaging server have problems staying in touch with the user server after some logins. We also get those region unavailable messages in 0.6.9 RC1.  We have a single 32 bit Windows Vista server for the URM (R=AI) services and the regions (Opensim.exe) server.

Justin CC and myself spent a lot of time in December trying to pin things down and could not.  Justin thinks it might be my DNS or host/network setup, but it does work fine on earlier versions of Opensim (before 0.6.6). We are hoping it will just &quot;go away&quot; when the refactored services in 0.7 are available.

Sorry I have no fixes to suggest.  But your different environment observation of what appears to be similar symptoms might help point te way to an underlying problem.
