<PRE>Hi, 

thanx for the encouragement. Not really being a coder, I feel I want to 
contribute somehow.

My fun little boilerplate on the top of the page is a not-quite-serious jab at 
the &quot;that-vaguely-resembles-my-one-you-stole-my-idea-you-content-thief&quot; 
hysteria that has been present on SL-exchange (now X-Street SL) as long as I 
have been using the service (though I have never had it directed at me). 
Though, in Australian Law at least (we all know the USA is legally weird :-P 
), what I said is all true AFAIK. I have more to worry about from Australia's 
newly infamous net-porn thought-crime laws for this set! :-/

I considered a CC license for these, but I really want these to be fully 
Public Domain, if only because they were so easy to produce from well-
established memes, that to claim any rights over them at all would be plain 
silly. I have other stuff I will be releasing (one day) under other licenses 
because they took me more than five minutes of slack time between service 
call-outs at work to make.

Again, thanks for the feedback.

Lae
