Another possable resion is mono isant allowing enough threads. I had a
situation like that b4. As far as how many, i think OSGrid has the current
record of 88 connected in one region at the same time It may be higher now
though. Anyway you may want to have a look at threads and also stackheap
limmits in mono. Your system sounds more than able to handle about whatever
is thrown at it.
Our record is at 58 users but thats all we could scrape up at the time but
that was on win32 at an older rev..
