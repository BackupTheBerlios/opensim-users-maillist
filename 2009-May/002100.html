<PRE>Ralf,

I see your point.  If I'm the creator of items inside SL then something like
Second Inventory should suit me well.

But my own experiences attempting to copy things I've made out of SL,
especially fairly complex ones, like buildings that are comprised of 1,000+
prims, a problem with drifting prims sometimes arises.  It's a bit
disheartening to try to copy a whole building to find I basically have to go
through the structure from top to bottom edging prims back into alignment.
It's almost less effort to simply rebuild from the ground up in OpenSim.

However, I do very much like the idea of using OpenSim as a sandbox and then
importing my creations into SL.  I'm just still really shaky on the
preservation of rights.  A couple attepts I made showed some odd behaviour
with importing multi-prim items where the rights seemed to be preserved with
the item but the individual pieces would not allow me to modify them once in
SL due to no-mod being somehow set per prim.

</I>&gt;<i> I think it's not so much a matter of if it can be done, but maybe the
</I>&gt;<i> question is - does anyone want to risk legal action in doing it?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One the one hand I think it's silly to prevent the simple transfer of
</I>&gt;<i> things
</I>&gt;<i> made in SL to a platform like OpenSim.  BUT I am also someone who has run a
</I>&gt;<i> fairly successful business in SL the last few years and know that one of
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> chief obstacles that Linden Lab has attempted to overcome is rights
</I>&gt;<i> management that governs my ability as a seller of virtual items the right
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> choose who can and cannot obtain copies of my products and what they can
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> cannot do with them once they own them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, I too am a bit stressed at the moment as I realize I have to
</I>&gt;<i> literally recreate every item I have in SL one prim at a time in OpenSim.
</I>&gt;<i> At times I get frustrated with it, but then I remind myself that if it were
</I>&gt;<i> a simple matter to replicate and transfer entire buildings and other items
</I>&gt;<i> from SL to OpenSim then the entire economic system Linden Lab has
</I>&gt;<i> structured
</I>&gt;<i> would collapse within a matter of days.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At times though, I do envision some sort of process wherein I could appear
</I>&gt;<i> in the center of an entire region in SL and press a magic button and
</I>&gt;<i> suddenly the entire content of the whole region would be downloaded to my
</I>&gt;<i> local OpenSim region.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I just don't think the idea is very practical if there is any future
</I>&gt;<i> intention of utilizing OpenSim for financial gain at all.  This appears (to
</I>&gt;<i> me at least) to be a telltale forking point in OpenSim development.  Do we
</I>&gt;<i> control and restrict duplication rights so as to channel creativity down
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> path SL follows where people buy our virtual goods, or do we harbor a truly
</I>&gt;<i> open platform where anything and everything we create can ultimately be
</I>&gt;<i> duplicated by others in a matter of seconds through a simple click of the
</I>&gt;<i> mouse?
