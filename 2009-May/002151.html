<PRE>This is probably related to how the Update routine handles sending updates to clients.

</I>&gt;<i> Subject: [Opensim-users] Prims and CPU usage?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Gang,
</I>&gt;<i>     After trying a few of the higher prim oar files I've seen fly
</I>&gt;<i> through here I've begun to notice a rather curious trend, although I'm
</I>&gt;<i> unsure if its to do with my configuration or if others have seen this
</I>&gt;<i> as
</I>&gt;<i> well.  After trying Nebadon's Art City oar on a local standalone (Mono
</I>&gt;<i> 2.0.1 / SQLite, Basic Physics on Linux Ubuntu) I found that after
</I>&gt;<i> everything loaded and committed to the database (which on its own took
</I>&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;<i> good hour and a half probably due to SQLite) upon restarting OpenSim
</I>&gt;<i> cpu
</I>&gt;<i> use for the OpenSim process was pinned at 30% when idle.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Oddly enough, since I started building my Ravenport sims (Mono 2.0.1
</I>&gt;<i> /
</I>&gt;<i> MySql, ODE / ZeroMesh on Ubuntu) I've as well noticed a steady increase
</I>&gt;<i> in cpu use as the build progressed, however until now I thought this
</I>&gt;<i> was
</I>&gt;<i> due to scripts or possibly a few rogue physical prims that may have
</I>&gt;<i> sunk
</I>&gt;<i> under ground or flown off the sim edge.  Currently when idle the
</I>&gt;<i> Ravenport server is using 25% of the cpu at ~13,000 prims where a month
</I>&gt;<i> ago it bordered around 10 to 15% at roughly 7,000 prims.  Out of
</I>&gt;<i> curiosity I saved the sims out to an oar and began dissecting them on
</I>&gt;<i> the same local configuration I tested the Art City  oar on.
</I>&gt;<i> Surprisingly after removing all scripted objects there was no change in
</I>&gt;<i> cpu use - it was still at 25%.  It wasn't until I began deleting the
</I>&gt;<i> buildings that I began to notice a change where as the sims emptied out
</I>&gt;<i> the cpu use decreased down to between 1 and 2% once all prims were
</I>&gt;<i> deleted.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   To verify, I decided to try again this time with a clean OpenSim
</I>&gt;<i> instance of the same config where I had set a scripted prim to create a
</I>&gt;<i> grid of default .5x.5x.5 cubes.  The first round was with a grid of
</I>&gt;<i> 13,000 prims which upon persisting and rebooting pinned the cpu at 30%,
</I>&gt;<i> the second test I added another 13,000 which brought it up to 40%.
</I>&gt;<i> After adding another 13,000 (39,000 total) the cpu was pinned at a
</I>&gt;<i> solid
</I>&gt;<i> 100% after a fresh restart.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   I have to admit, I do find this to be quite baffling.  In all I'd
</I>&gt;<i> expect the sim to use more memory with a higher prim count but the cpu
</I>&gt;<i> should remain about the same, especially given that my test environment
</I>&gt;<i> was using basic physics where all prims were rendered as phantom.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   The oar for the 39,000 prim sim is located at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.pseudospace.net/primzilla.oar">http://www.pseudospace.net/primzilla.oar</A> if anyone else would like to
</I>&gt;<i> test it on their own configuration.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks, :)
