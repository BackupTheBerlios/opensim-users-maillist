<PRE>Hi Marian,

 

ReactionGrid is spread over several servers, so you will get different
IP address returned for different sims - and a grid like OSGrid would
have many different IP addresses since anyone can connect a sim to the
main grid. I would suggest the Shard header from the http request, if
set by the grid operator as detailed in opensim.ini.example, is probably
the best way to go. Note that current revision deployed on ReactionGrid
doesn't seem to pick up this value from the ini, but tested against a
newer release it does seem to set correctly, so will hopefully be
available on our grid in the next week or two. 

 

Thanks,

Chris

Subject: [Opensim-users] How to find out which openSim your avatar is in

 

Hi there,

I'm developing a grid independent messaging tool and I need to find out
in which grid the avatar is currently logged in. I can use a scripted
attachment and call my webserver, but I wonder what's the best method
would be to find out in which grid (secondlife, osgrid, openlife-grid,
reaction grid, legend city, etc) the script is currently running. I
think the REMOTE_ADDRESS may help here, but I found that in secondlife
for example, several sims are running on different IP address.

Does anybody have a clue for me how to solve this problem?

Thanks

Marian
