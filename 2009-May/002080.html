<PRE>Hi everyone!  I've been a very active user of Second Life for the last 3
years and have spent a good deal of my time using OpenSim as an end-user for
the past 6 months.

I'm curious to learn if there are any pre-built virtual worlds, as in
pre-built entire sims that are available for download anywhere.  While I've
had a lot of fun building within my own sim, I just thought it might be a
nice change of pace to be able to download and access someone elses freely
available world that they built.

Are there any such worlds out there?  I think, especially for those fairly
new to OpenSim, that having a fully &quot;stocked&quot; world with buildings, trees,
terraforming, and such would be a great way to see what life in a virtual
world is like - instead of the current &quot;new empty region&quot; method of starting
out in OpenSim.

I even think it might be a fun exercise to host a forum specifically for
self-created worlds that users can share with one another - considering, of
course, that the content is not exclusive or copyrighted in any manner.

Of course, I know that we all can simply log into worlds hosted elsewhere,
but having a world one can download to play around with locally would, to
me, be really great!

Any thoughts on this?
