<PRE>Len,

does that mean you rebuild in opensim what you did build in SL ?

I will not get into the legal discussion again, we have articles about that
from time to time at maxping.org - from legal to content security.

Since the problems cover aspects already seen in the internet, I am just
wondering why nobody take the chance to start a solution for that as
service.  :-)

However, would it not be easier to use a tool to transfer stuff ?  if not
second inventory (the seem to be stuck, somehow.  The folder and nested prim
restore was promised for end 2008) - why not the libsl (aehm.. openmv)
testclient (aka copybot) ?

As long as you are the creator, I don&#180;t even see any legal issues.
Scripts are basicly text-copy - so no big issue that you can&#180;t export them
that way.

Cheers,
Ralf

OpenSim

I think it's not so much a matter of if it can be done, but maybe the
question is - does anyone want to risk legal action in doing it?

One the one hand I think it's silly to prevent the simple transfer of things
made in SL to a platform like OpenSim.  BUT I am also someone who has run a
fairly successful business in SL the last few years and know that one of the
chief obstacles that Linden Lab has attempted to overcome is rights
management that governs my ability as a seller of virtual items the right to
choose who can and cannot obtain copies of my products and what they can and
cannot do with them once they own them.

However, I too am a bit stressed at the moment as I realize I have to
literally recreate every item I have in SL one prim at a time in OpenSim.
At times I get frustrated with it, but then I remind myself that if it were
a simple matter to replicate and transfer entire buildings and other items
from SL to OpenSim then the entire economic system Linden Lab has structured
would collapse within a matter of days.

At times though, I do envision some sort of process wherein I could appear
in the center of an entire region in SL and press a magic button and
suddenly the entire content of the whole region would be downloaded to my
local OpenSim region.

I just don't think the idea is very practical if there is any future
intention of utilizing OpenSim for financial gain at all.  This appears (to
me at least) to be a telltale forking point in OpenSim development.  Do we
control and restrict duplication rights so as to channel creativity down the
path SL follows where people buy our virtual goods, or do we harbor a truly
open platform where anything and everything we create can ultimately be
duplicated by others in a matter of seconds through a simple click of the
mouse?

- Len
