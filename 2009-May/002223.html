<PRE>Speaking as one of the owners of ReactionGrid - this is a new product we
are launching because we have folks who are interested in OpenSim as a
behind a firewall solution. We host many grids for clients that are not
public already, so this is just an evolution from hosting an OpenSim
grid on one of our servers, to hosting it on one of theirs, but with
some support. We already spend time in-world with private grid clients
to help them make the most of what they have, and we will do our best to
help the behind-the-firewall solution customers too with training and
support. 

We love the potential of OpenSim, but we are not blind to its
limitations, and we never hide this from people. We run a public grid,
we host public events, and yes, we crash! we know as well as you do that
this is an alpha - but it's one hell of an alpha that, if you can work
with it and not against it, is extremely rewarding and has enormous
potential for all sorts of sectors. We have kids on our grid every day
learning about geometry, textures, colour pallets, you name it - and the
energy you see from them when they get things looking the way they want,
getting a script running, or enthusing about meeting some kids from the
other side of the world - it's infectious! I'm sorry, I kinda love that
part of my job, and that's all thanks to the current state of OpenSim,
which goes straight back to the devs who work on it.

Jani and Ralf have written many articles about us already, and for that
we are grateful :) I am very open to hearing any opinions on our plans
from anyone else, on either side of whatever fence we are on today.

I'd like to hear comments about this. Comments by Opensim developers
who are not directly involved with ReactionGrid, if possible, would be
even better. That would greatly help me in a better understanding of 
the whole situation, as actually I'm a bit concerned by this kind 
of news. Please, note that I don't mean to offend anyone at 
ReactionGrid (or Maxping) with this message - also note I'm not a
native english speaker.


1. software:
Opensim (as a software) is not complete yet.
It doesn't offer all features that Second Life (as a software) offers.

2. community:
Opensim-based grids have a limited number of users.
The Second Life grid has &lt;put SL stats here&gt; a relevant number of users.

3. service:
Opensim-based solution providers are obviously still young and small.
Linden Lab [even if you hated them] has many years of managing a 
full-featured, huge grid and providing related services (support,
money exchange, inventory management, online trading..)


That's why I fear that stating &quot;Opensim is competing with Second Life&quot;, 
or &quot;this Opensim-based solution is better than / was launched before
than the Linden Lab one&quot;, or something like that, could have negative
effects on how Opensim is perceived.

Isn't this &quot;First!&quot; attitude potentially dangerous when we communicate 
and explain Opensim's development?

What do you think about that?


Best wishes,
Opensource Obscure
