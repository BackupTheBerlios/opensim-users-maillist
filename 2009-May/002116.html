&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've been working on a standalone sim for some time. It is a very
</I>&gt;<i> mountainous terrain; I have a specific landscape in mind that I want
</I>&gt;<i> to model.
</I>&gt;<i> I created a height map in an external tool, exported it as a 7 by 7
</I>&gt;<i> region, and worked on it a bit more from within Hippo, and altogether
</I>&gt;<i> it works rather well.
</I>&gt;<i> I must say I am impressed by the level of realism. The water in
</I>&gt;<i> particularly is lovely!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Im running the server on a Virtualbox'ed Arch Linux installation with
</I>&gt;<i> PostgreSQL as storage for all.
</I>&gt;<i> The opensim is version  0.6.4 / interface3; It's got 1.5 Mb memory
</I>&gt;<i> assigned so far, and that runs well. I am using the opensim-ode.sh
</I>&gt;<i> start script which sets the Mono threads per cpu at 50; and ulimit is
</I>&gt;<i> set to 50000.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are a couple of things that I wondered about and could not find
</I>&gt;<i> an answer to yet - I am still rather new to all this. If you would
</I>&gt;<i> know some answers, that would be very helpful :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - The first is - I would like to have some other trees than the ones
</I>&gt;<i> that are available now. Is it possible to create one in, say, Blender,
</I>&gt;<i> and import that (b/c I know how to make trees in Blender)? So far, I
</I>&gt;<i> have found no repository of objects to use in Opensim (apart from the
</I>&gt;<i> discussions about importing SL stuff - but I have never been in SL).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Another, similar one .. did any of you ever create rocks or
</I>&gt;<i> boulders? Would a &quot;sculpted prim&quot; be the way to go here?
</I>&gt;<i> I find building more or less geometric forms very easy with the Build
</I>&gt;<i> tool - including more complex things. But it is indeed hard to create
</I>&gt;<i> anything naturally - looking, irregular.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - is there a way to use larger region texture files than 512 x 512? I
</I>&gt;<i> find these smaller ones to make mountains look not that natural. Most
</I>&gt;<i> textures give a rather unnatural repetitive effect.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - is it possible to create another global light source, other than the
</I>&gt;<i> Sun or Moon? Like a large beacon with a bright light, illuminating one
</I>&gt;<i> or more regions?
</I>&gt;<i> The light-emitting prims don't reach very far.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - there are sometimes cracks or tears in the ground; even outside of
</I>&gt;<i> the region seams (which are indeed sometimes hard to match up). You
</I>&gt;<i> can see through these cracks to the water behind them, and it is
</I>&gt;<i> possible to fly your avatar through it; in which case I seem to get
</I>&gt;<i> stuck in some infinite loop and have to login again. This does not
</I>&gt;<i> happen often though and I understand that all this is still alpha
</I>&gt;<i> software; but I wondered if it is known what causes it and if I can
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;cure&quot; that.
</I>&gt;<i> Here's a screenshot of what I meant - the green line is a region
</I>&gt;<i> border (made visible in the menu with View Property Lines); but the
</I>&gt;<i> crack in the foreground with the terraform tool arrows on it, is not a
</I>&gt;<i> border <A HREF="http://img.skitch.com/20090509-xa56mn59rax164ji3qfbf9t3h8.jpg">http://img.skitch.com/20090509-xa56mn59rax164ji3qfbf9t3h8.jpg</A>
</I>&gt;<i> And the strangest thing is - these cracks can vanish all of a sudden.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> .
</I>&gt;<i> - I understood that the total possible size of the sim (nr of regions)
</I>&gt;<i> depends on available memory, number of prims, number of users walking
</I>&gt;<i> around and / or building things in it.
</I>&gt;<i> Would it be possible to give a rough estimate what kind of hardware
</I>&gt;<i> would  be necessary to build a very large sim of - say - 200 regions,
</I>&gt;<i> but most just empty terrain ... on average not more than 10 prims per
</I>&gt;<i> region.  Never more than 8 concurrent users, and max 2 users building
</I>&gt;<i> at the same time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - and the last one - is it possible *in principle* to see further than
</I>&gt;<i> the current &quot;max viewing distance&quot; setting of 512 meters in Hippo?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> thanks!
</I>&gt;<i>
