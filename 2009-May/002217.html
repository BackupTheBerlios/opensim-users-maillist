&gt;<i> Good news for Opensim, and congratulations to ReactionGrid!

I'd like to hear comments about this. Comments by Opensim developers
who are not directly involved with ReactionGrid, if possible, would be
even better. That would greatly help me in a better understanding of 
the whole situation, as actually I'm a bit concerned by this kind 
of news. Please, note that I don't mean to offend anyone at 
ReactionGrid (or Maxping) with this message - also note I'm not a
native english speaker.


1. software:
Opensim (as a software) is not complete yet.
It doesn't offer all features that Second Life (as a software) offers.

2. community:
Opensim-based grids have a limited number of users.
The Second Life grid has &lt;put SL stats here&gt; a relevant number of users.

3. service:
Opensim-based solution providers are obviously still young and small.
Linden Lab [even if you hated them] has many years of managing a 
full-featured, huge grid and providing related services (support,
money exchange, inventory management, online trading..)


That's why I fear that stating &quot;Opensim is competing with Second Life&quot;, 
or &quot;this Opensim-based solution is better than / was launched before
than the Linden Lab one&quot;, or something like that, could have negative
effects on how Opensim is perceived.

Isn't this &quot;First!&quot; attitude potentially dangerous when we communicate 
and explain Opensim's development?

What do you think about that?


Best wishes,
Opensource Obscure
