I don't believe it is possible, but I'm not 100% certain of that.
Also, those &quot;Linden&quot; trees are client-side effects, so even if you
could make a change you'd see that new version in all regions, and
nobody else would see your texture unless they modded their viewer the
same.

&gt;&gt;<i> However, trees can also be made out of clumps of sculpties or from  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> flat prims with pictures of trees on them (3 such flat prims  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> together, rotated at 120deg to eachother will give the tree some 3D  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> body and doesn't look bad from mid-to-long distances. Custom trees  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> like these won't bend in the wind though.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I wonder if it is possible to import a tree built in Blender as such a  
</I>&gt;<i>collection of sculpties: I will look at that (I have seen some info on  
</I>&gt;<i>creating sculpties in Blender)
</I>
Depending on the shapes, you may well be able to do that, but
sculpties are pretty limited.  Most &quot;sculpty&quot; trees are actually a
combination of several sculpty prims for the trunk and major branches,
and standard prims with semi-transparent textures for the smaller
branches and foliage.

It's incorrect to say that prim trees cannot bend in the wind - simple
flat-prim trees, as LaeMing describes, can be constructed of &quot;flexi&quot;
prims that respond to wind movement.  As long as you get the prim
shape right, and use the same for all 3 (or 4 or however many) prims,
it will bend quite effectively.  I know, I've made some. ;-)

I'd recommend creating an OSGrid (or even SL) account and wandering
around in there to say what people have done - in general, and
specifically with trees.  I never cease to be stunned by the amount of
creativity and talent - not to mention technical expertise - that's
out there, and so much of it is freely available, even in SL.

&gt;&gt;<i> Another viewer limitation - IIRC, SL has a limit of 8 active light  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sources (1 for sun/moon, 7 for prims), presumably because of  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> limitations of graphics cards at the low end.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>that need not be a problem if I could, say, make the sun and/or moon  
</I>&gt;<i>invisible and yet leave the lighting intact. If I then create a light  
</I>&gt;<i>source and arrange things so per region that the sun- or moonlight  
</I>&gt;<i>seems to originate from the direction of the new light source, that  
</I>&gt;<i>might work - except that the light direction in the region where the  
</I>&gt;<i>source resides would seem off.
</I>
You can't override that.  As I understand it, the limit of 8 is
imposed by software external to SL/OS, and the view reserves 2 for the
sun and moon (separate sources) and leaves the remaining 6 for prims.
If there are more light-emitting prims around you than 6, only the
nearest 6 to you will appear to emit light.

&gt;&gt;<i> Sounds like a bug in stitching the regions together, likely when the  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> two regions are being rendered at different LODs (Levels Of Detail).  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I suspect this because of the way the gaps disappear - if the  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> regions suddenly start displaying the same LOD, this is what would  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be expected.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Yes. I payed closer attention to this, and it looks as if it is indeed  
</I>&gt;<i>connected with this level of detail.
</I>&gt;<i>When I log in and there are these tears all over, it is also the case  
</I>&gt;<i>that there is much less detail in the shape of the terrain. Then at a  
</I>&gt;<i>given moment, the details will suddenly snap into place and the tears  
</I>&gt;<i>also disappear.
</I>
You may be able to fix this by changing your graphics settings within
Hippo's &quot;preferences&quot;.  Try bumping up mesh detail for terrain
(edit/preferences/graphics/custom).

&gt;&gt;<i> LindenLabs (who's viewer Hippo is extended from) have been talking  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about  terrain-to-the-horizon for over a year. I am pretty sure it  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is possible to do  but would require some reworking of the viewer  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and possibly the server.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Normally the viewer is only plugged into its current sim and the 8  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> adjacent  sims. To render further would require plugging into more  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sims at once, which  becomes an exponentially increasing load on  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> both the viewer and the sims.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Rendering only terrain (and not objects) to the horizon is the  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> compromise LL  is thinking of as it loads up the viewer more (but  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> only if the user turns it on) and only minimally increases load on  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the sims (fetching height-maps, but not the rest of the sim contents).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I would certainly be more than happy with the &quot;just terrain&quot; option,  
</I>&gt;<i>because I do not intend to build structures that would be visible over  
</I>&gt;<i>that distance.
</I>&gt;<i>Maybe I'll  have a look at the code to figure out whether this is hard  
</I>&gt;<i>to do - (I am a dev, though a java one - I never worked with dotnet).
</I>
I'm not a OS dev either, but like you I am a dev in other areas.  I
think you'd need to look at both the client (especially the client,
since that's doing the drawing) and the region (and asset?) servers
(to serve the textures and height-maps of distant regions).  I hope
you've got courage - I'm trembling just thinking about it!  ;-)  

Hope this helps - and bear in mind I'm by no means an expert.
