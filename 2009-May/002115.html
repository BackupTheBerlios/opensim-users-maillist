<PRE>Hi LaeMing

thank you! This is very helpful.

</I>&gt;<i> Trees in SL are a special object made from a simple algorithm and a

</I>&gt;<i> Might be possible to change the texture.
</I>
If that were possible, it would already be very useful (except for the  
Laburnum which should have lots of flowers :).


&gt;<i> However, trees can also be made out of clumps of sculpties or from

</I>&gt;<i> like these won't bend in the wind though.
</I>
I wonder if it is possible to import a tree built in Blender as such a  
collection of sculpties: I will look at that (I have seen some info on  
creating sculpties in Blender)

&gt;<i> Natural shapes are exactly what sculpties are for :-) While you CAN  
</I>&gt;<i> make complex regular shapes too, it often doesn't look so good to my  
</I>&gt;<i> eye.
</I>&gt;<i> See: <A HREF="http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Sculpted_Prims:_3d_Software_Guide">http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Sculpted_Prims:_3d_Software_Guide</A>
</I>
Thank you! I missed that one, it seems to cover all I need.

&gt;<i> Another viewer limitation - IIRC, SL has a limit of 8 active light  
</I>&gt;<i> sources (1 for sun/moon, 7 for prims), presumably because of  
</I>&gt;<i> limitations of graphics cards at the low end.
</I>
that need not be a problem if I could, say, make the sun and/or moon  
invisible and yet leave the lighting intact. If I then create a light  
source and arrange things so per region that the sun- or moonlight  
seems to originate from the direction of the new light source, that  
might work - except that the light direction in the region where the  
source resides would seem off.


&gt;<i> Sounds like a bug in stitching the regions together, likely when the  
</I>&gt;<i> two regions are being rendered at different LODs (Levels Of Detail).  
</I>&gt;<i> I suspect this because of the way the gaps disappear - if the  
</I>&gt;<i> regions suddenly start displaying the same LOD, this is what would  
</I>&gt;<i> be expected.
</I>
Yes. I payed closer attention to this, and it looks as if it is indeed  
connected with this level of detail.
When I log in and there are these tears all over, it is also the case  
that there is much less detail in the shape of the terrain. Then at a  
given moment, the details will suddenly snap into place and the tears  
also disappear.

&gt;<i> LindenLabs (who's viewer Hippo is extended from) have been talking  
</I>&gt;<i> about  terrain-to-the-horizon for over a year. I am pretty sure it  
</I>&gt;<i> is possible to do  but would require some reworking of the viewer  
</I>&gt;<i> and possibly the server.
</I>&gt;<i> Normally the viewer is only plugged into its current sim and the 8  
</I>&gt;<i> adjacent  sims. To render further would require plugging into more  
</I>&gt;<i> sims at once, which  becomes an exponentially increasing load on  
</I>&gt;<i> both the viewer and the sims.
</I>&gt;<i> Rendering only terrain (and not objects) to the horizon is the  
</I>&gt;<i> compromise LL  is thinking of as it loads up the viewer more (but  
</I>&gt;<i> only if the user turns it on) and only minimally increases load on  
</I>&gt;<i> the sims (fetching height-maps, but not the rest of the sim contents).
</I>
I would certainly be more than happy with the &quot;just terrain&quot; option,  
because I do not intend to build structures that would be visible over  
that distance.
Maybe I'll  have a look at the code to figure out whether this is hard  
to do - (I am a dev, though a java one - I never worked with dotnet).

&gt;<i> Hope this helps
</I>
it certainly did!

thank you
