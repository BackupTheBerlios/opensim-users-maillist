<PRE>
Luthien,

 

welcome to the list.

 

Please rest assured that this list is indeed intended to be a helpful list for all who are interested in opensim.

 

We strive to keep the tone here friendly and to the point.

 

As with all public fora and lists, there is a certain amount of noise, some of it in the form of good-mannered in-group banter, and some of it in the form of occasional hateful outbreaks and trolling [1].

 

The former is acceptable, the latter intolerable.

 

Other than that, 'please don't feed the troll'. *points at sign at entrance*


Best regards,
Stefan Andersson

concluding: until two days ago I had the impression that this was a helpful list for all who are interested in opensim.  
But it looks more and more like I have, by accident, strolled into a text-only version of some RPG.

When this current flurry started I first thought it was a joke. Then I thought it was about a serious grudge someone carried. Then it looked like a joke again - a joke though of a variety that required extensive knowledge of complex intrigues.and highly specialized innuendo. 

This switched back and forth a couple of times more, and by now it seems like even this switching is part of some game that is played here and, for me, only adds to the confusion. 

I have no idea, and probably most other newer list members, what this is all about. I am not interested in games; I came here because I am interested in opensim. 
I only know that things like this certainly cause damage to the list, and I wish that whatever it is about would be settled off list. 

Duh. Now please, stop it. 
Pretty please?

*impressions from a newbie*

at first I had the impression that you all engaged in some form of shared geek humour in here - like a prolonged April fool's day - but I must admit that I have completely lost my bearings now as to what is serious and what not. 

Is this some specialised form of folklore?
