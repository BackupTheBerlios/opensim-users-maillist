<PRE>I'm afraid that that my successful map teleport yesterday was a red herring. 
Basically my grid was working as usual, with teleports into my grid being
impossible for the first several hours after a restart, then becoming
intermittent, and finally working without any problems.  It was probably in
the intermittent phase when I tried it last night.

This morning, after my grid had been running for about 21 hours, I was able
to teleport into it with no problem from both Wright Plaza and Sanctuary. I
then restarted my grid and immediately tried teleporting to it, but all
attempts failed.  One interesting clue is that the same thing happened as
when they failed yesterday: attempting to teleport from Wright Plaza gave
the error message that the destination could not be found, but attempting a
teleport from Sanctuary gave the error message that there was a problem at
the destination.

I'm continuing to work on the problem whenever I have a few moments when I
can take a break from other tasks. 

If anyone else wants to test it, my grid's hypergrid address is

</I>&gt;<i> 2) It could confirm an initialization problem in my config files and that
</I>&gt;<i> the successful TP back from Wright Plaza using the map initialized things
</I>&gt;<i> properly.

</I>&gt;<i> I'll try it again immediately after I restart the system tomorrow morning. 
</I>&gt;<i> The problems happen most consistently in the hours immediately after a

</I>&gt;<i> My grid is up every day, but I frequently do testing and development
</I>&gt;<i> between 5am and noon Pacific Time, so my grid is sometimes down and is
</I>&gt;<i> subject to going down without notice during those hours.  I keep it up the
</I>&gt;<i> rest of the time.
