<PRE>Hi Erik,
For me its not so strange Hypergrid doesnt work properly.I tried for a few years several grids. Sometimes it works but not always.I never understood why.Because of TP I put always in opensim.ini  OSFunctionThreatLevel = VeryHigh

	XenaW, that's really interesting about you being able to teleport from Sanctuary but not from your grid.  I've been testing teleporting back from several grids, but not yet Sanctuary.


The problem tends to be intermittent.  It probably just happened to clear up when you teleported from Sanctuary to my grid.   I tried it just now and was not able to teleport to my grid from either Wright Plaza or Sanctuary.


The interesting thing is that I get a different error message for the two grids.  When I try to teleport back from Wright Plaza, I get the message that the destination cannot be found, but teleporting back from Santuary I get the message that there's a problem at the destination.  I don't have time to look into it today, but will  look at it again this evening or tomorrow.


As I've said in previous posts, the problem tends to happen most during the hours after I first restart my grid.  Then it becomes intermittent, then it clears up entirely.  This leads me to suspect something in my config files not being initialized correctly, but Justincc suspects it may be a network problem.   I'm looking into both my network and my config files as possible causes.
