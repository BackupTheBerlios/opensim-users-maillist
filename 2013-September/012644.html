<PRE>I was taking a quick break from being deep at work on an unrelated project
when I made this post, so I didn't think it through and it didn't occur to
me that OSThreatLevel, Allow_osTeleportAgent, and Creators_osTeleportAgent
are not related to my problem.  Those apply to scripted teleporters and they
are working fine.  It's only teleporting /into/ my grid from other grids
that's a problem.

&gt;<i> XenaW, I had hypergrid teleporting working reliably for two years, but
</I>&gt;<i> problems started after I switched from 07.1.1 to 0.7.5.  My initial
</I>&gt;<i> solution was like yours, to raise OSThreatLevel to VeryHigh.  Out of
</I>&gt;<i> security concerns, I did it in just two regions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However the weakened security made me nervous, so I almost immediately
</I>&gt;<i> switched back to setting it to VeryLow and instead I currently use the
</I>&gt;<i> following settings:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Allow_osTeleportAgent = PARCEL_OWNER, ESTATE_OWNER, ESTATE_MANAGER
</I>&gt;<i> Creators_osTeleportAgent = PARCEL_OWNER, ESTATE_OWNER, ESTATE_MANAGER
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am doing contract work for a company that on my recommendation used
</I>&gt;<i> these same values in the company's grid and is not having my problems so I
</I>&gt;<i> don't think it's the problem, but I'm interested in hearing what
</I>&gt;<i> experiences others have had.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For me its not so strange Hypergrid doesnt work properly.I tried for a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> few years several grids. Sometimes it works but not always.I never
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> understood why.Because of TP I put always in opensim.ini 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OSFunctionThreatLevel = VeryHigh
