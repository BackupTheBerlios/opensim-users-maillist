<PRE>This might be another clue.  After my grid was up for 6.75 hours, I tried
TP'ing back from Wright Plaza with an LM but as usual it failed.  I then
tried R. Gunther's suggestion and used the map. This time the TP succeeded.  

I then went back to Wright Plaza and tried TP'ing back to my grid again with
an LM, but this time it succeeded. I also succeeded with an LM from
Sanctuary.

This could mean one of three things:
1) A difference between how the map and LM are handling my TPs
2) Because the problem tends to go away after my grid has been running for a
while, I might just have happened to run the test at a time when the problem
was going away or becoming intermittent.
3) It could confirm an initialization problem in my config files and that
the successful TP back from Wright Plaza using the map initialized things
properly.

I'll try it again immediately after I restart the system tomorrow morning. 
The problems happen most consistently in the hours immediately after a
restart.

Thanks to everyone who has made suggestions!

If anyone else wants to test it, my hypergrid address is
<A HREF="http://marin.us.com:8002.">http://marin.us.com:8002.</A> 

My grid is up every day, but I frequently do testing and development between
5am and noon Pacific Time, so my grid is sometimes down and is subject to
going down without notice during those hours.  I keep it up the rest of the
time.
