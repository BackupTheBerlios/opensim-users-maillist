Dear colleagues,

In 2010-12, with colleagues from Charles Sturt University (CSU), the University of New England (UNE), and the University of Southern Queensland (USQ), I worked on a project that involved conducting an Australia and New Zealand-wide scoping study on the use of virtual worlds for learning and teaching in higher education. The final report from the project is now available as an open-access publication:

Dalgarno, B., Gregory, S., Carlson, L., Lee, M. J. W., &amp; Tynan, B. (2013). A systematic review and environmental analysis of the use of 3D immersive virtual worlds in Australian and New Zealand higher education institutions [Final report]. Armidale, Australia: University of New England, DEHub. Available from <A HREF="http://www.dehub.edu.au/publications/books/">http://www.dehub.edu.au/publications/books/</A>

Please feel free to direct others who you think might be interested to this resource.

The scoping study project was funded by the Distance Education Hub (DEHub), a research consortium based at UNE and involving CSU, USQ, and CQU (Central Queensland University) in Australia as well as Massey University in New Zealand. DEHub was initially established through a grant from the Australian Government Department of Industry, Innovation, Science, Research and Tertiary Education (DIISRTE) and now continues to operate under the sponsorship of UNE, providing a wealth of resources and activities aimed at promoting scholarship and innovation in online and distance learning. I encourage you to check out their newly redeveloped website at <A HREF="http://www.dehub.edu.au/.">http://www.dehub.edu.au/.</A>
