<PRE>I've had the hypergrid working for over two years, initially on a Diva
standalone and currently on a grid.  Recently have been having a strange
problem: intermittently it becomes impossible to teleport into my grid. We
can teleport out and return using Teleport Home, but sometimes it's
impossible to use a landmark or teleporter to teleport in.

Yesterday for example, one of my users reported being unable to use a
teleporter in another grid to teleport to my grid.  I confirmed that it was
a problem, but a few hours later, teleports were normal again.  I had not
restarted my grid or made any changes.  This morning, after a restart but no
changes, the teleport in problem has returned.  I can teleport out but not
in.

Here is my configuration info (I built the server myself):
=========================================
OpenSim 0.7.5
18 regions (mostly openspace)
five OpenSim instances
one MySQL database
one Robust instance
OpenSUSE 11.4 Linux server with 16GB RAM and Intel Core i7-2600 Sandy Bridge
3.4GHz 4 core
DSL (sonic.net)
Hypergrid address:  <A HREF="http://marin.us.com:8002">http://marin.us.com:8002</A>

I realize that the DSL can be a problem.  So far I have only a few users. 
Sonic.net is such an excellent provider that I'm waiting until I have more
users to switch to a faster provider (I can't get Sonic's much faster Fusion
service where I live).

If anyone has suggestions, I'll greatly appreciate hearing them.  This one
is driving me nuts.
