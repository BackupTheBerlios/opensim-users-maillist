<PRE>Hi Chris.  From your note on Mantis 5840 [1], it looks like this issue suddenly went away for you, albeit without 
identifying why?

If not (or if anybody else is having a similar issue) we need to open a new mantis for investigation as Mantis 5840 is 
really for something different.

</I>&gt;<i> The only thing that I can tell that fixes it is to completely recompile all the scripts in the attachments.

</I>&gt;<i> This only seems to affect attachments and scripts that were made before the commit that introduced this issue. Newly

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am not sure which commit this started happening in but I was able to revert back to commit 337ea01 (r/19717) and

</I>&gt;<i> Is anyone else having this issue?
