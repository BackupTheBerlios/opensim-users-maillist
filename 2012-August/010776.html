<PRE>Welcome to the extended virtual family Lisa :)

My first suggestion (if you haven't already done so) is to sign up with
an OpenSim grid and begin exploring.  My personal recommendation would
be OSGrid (<A HREF="http://www.osgrid.org/">http://www.osgrid.org/</A>).  It's the largest and oldest and has
a wide variety of established regions to visit.  It's also the main
testing grid for OpenSim users and developers so pretty much anyone who
knows anything about OS is there at one time or another.  There are many
helpful people around who can give you advice and help get you started. 
Ther are also tons of freebies and building tools there too ;)

Sarge's links are also a great place to start.  Excelsior Station and
Enclave Harbour are two of the most ambitious and impressive
undertakings in OpenSim at the moment.  Good examples of just how far
you can take your ideas and apply them effectively.

There is also a sister mailing list to this one aimed at educators which
is populated by many of the same users here.  The info:

Education mailing list
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-users">Education at list.opensim-edu.org</A>
<A HREF="http://list.opensim-edu.org/listinfo.cgi/education-opensim-edu.org">http://list.opensim-edu.org/listinfo.cgi/education-opensim-edu.org</A>

Good luck with your endeavors and I hope to see you around the metaverse.

</I>&gt;<i>     Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I'm very new to OpenSim and just signed up to this list to ask a
</I>&gt;<i>     few questions. Sorry if I come across as a bit of a newbie,
</I>&gt;<i>     although I've been studying OS for a few days and I have my own
</I>&gt;<i>     standalone grid up and running at home.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I'm putting together a proposal for this educational portal run by
</I>&gt;<i>     the ABC here in Australia:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     <A HREF="http://www.abc.net.au/learn/proposals.htm">http://www.abc.net.au/learn/proposals.htm</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     My project is all about teaching history, the idea being that
</I>&gt;<i>     students and history classes could put together simple sims
</I>&gt;<i>     telling stories about the history of their own local area, linking
</I>&gt;<i>     them up with videos, photos, essays, etc (which you could
</I>&gt;<i>     hopefully launch from within the sim). Their sims would all be
</I>&gt;<i>     linked up in a hypergrid, so students from all over Australia
</I>&gt;<i>     (later maybe the world) could get into a virtual time machine and
</I>&gt;<i>     visit different places at different times, to see what was
</I>&gt;<i>     happening. Students would be able to chat with each other and show
</I>&gt;<i>     each other around their creations. Hopefully the act of
</I>&gt;<i>     collaborative world building would engage them in learning about
</I>&gt;<i>     history, but I would want them focussed on just telling small
</I>&gt;<i>     stories, involving a small number of characters (which would be
</I>&gt;<i>     created as NPCs if that's possible, with simple, looping
</I>&gt;<i>     animations if not more complex behaviour) and buildings, objects,
</I>&gt;<i>     etc. (I have ideas about how to source lots of 3D content, which I
</I>&gt;<i>     need to explore more).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I'm sure none of this is an original idea, but it seems like a
</I>&gt;<i>     good opportunity to put an idea like this forward. I just was
</I>&gt;<i>     wondering if anyone could tell me whether it would work in OpenSim
</I>&gt;<i>     or if there are some big barriers to creating something like this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     My main issue right now is trying to work out how you create sims
</I>&gt;<i>     that represent not only a region in space but also a period in
</I>&gt;<i>     time. I've been thinking that I would have a grid that contains
</I>&gt;<i>     regions in which only stories from, say, 1950 to 2000 were
</I>&gt;<i>     created. Then another grid would represent the same real world
</I>&gt;<i>     area, but contain stories from 1900-1950. The further you go back
</I>&gt;<i>     in time, the longer the time intervals would get, along an
</I>&gt;<i>     approximately logarithmic scale, so if you were telling stories
</I>&gt;<i>     about the dinosaurs one grid would represent the entire Jurassic
</I>&gt;<i>     era, for example.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Would this be the right way to go? I've been reading about regions
</I>&gt;<i>     and grids and hypergrids but I'm pretty sure there's a lot I don't
</I>&gt;<i>     understand.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     My own background is that I've been working in 3D animation for
</I>&gt;<i>     film, TV and games for the past decade, as a 3D all rounder and a
</I>&gt;<i>     technical artist. I've worked on one big MMO for three years that
</I>&gt;<i>     was never released. So I know about 3D modeling, animation,
</I>&gt;<i>     worldbuilding, etc. but I've never spent much time around Second
</I>&gt;<i>     Life or OpenSim, so a lot of this is new to me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Thanks for any help!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Lisa Evans
