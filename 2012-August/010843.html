<PRE>Hi all,

Just a note to say that I submitted my proposal for funding today. It 
will be a while before I hear whether it's successful or not, but of 
course I will let you all know. Thanks to everyone who helped me to 
refine my ideas and provided me with so many helpful links and great 
resources. I had no idea that what I was proposing was even possible 
until I asked my questions here! If we get the funding, I'll be back to 
continue the discussions that so many people opened up with me. Of 
course even if we don't get this funding, I'm going to look for other 
opportunities to do something similar, even if on a much smaller scale. 
So you'll probably hear from me again :)

Cheers,

Lisa Evans
