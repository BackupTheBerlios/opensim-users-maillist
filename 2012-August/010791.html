&gt;<i> Access challenges very much varies from State to State, and I can happily report things are getting a little easier as edu departments begin to finally embrace virtual worlds and games a little more eg. tafe projects like Virtual Enterprise @ jokaydiaGRID and the PLANE project - a NSW PD program for teachers which includes some opensim. However it is still probably the big risk factor to consider. The other is hardware..there are alot of year 9 laptops out there that WILL NOT run opensim. ;(

</I>&gt;<i> Having said that, things are much easier in VIC than NSW or QLD, but still a bit of a challenge. Solving port issues via viewer dev would indeed be a huge win, but a big challenge considering how wedded to port 80 and powerpoint alot edu IT departments are! ;) I also suspect that options for running it on SOAS or a local school server would also be very valuable.

</I>&gt;<i> Thanks, that helps me a lot to see that it's possible, and to be able to point the ABC at it too. If we used part of the budget, as Maria suggested to me, to develop an open source web viewer for OpenSim, would that help you too? That would get around the ports issue, wouldn't it?
</I>
Port access is controlled by at the school/ uni network level and so developing another viewer will not help in this regard.

Plenty of universities already allow the ports needed by SL/opensim to be used. For high schools it will be have to be managed through the school's participation program.

&gt;<i> Since this would all be run via the ABC's online education portal, you would think they would be able to arrange things with schools to get around the firewall of doom. That must be part of their plan already, otherwise they won't get very far!
