<PRE>I am saving up for a major computer upgrade.  But I am confused a bit 
about the operating system I will need to use.  The computer I am 
looking at has a twin CPU each with 16 cores, making a total of 32 
cores.  It also has room for 256GB of RAM.

Now I know I can't upgrade to any version of Windows 7 64bit that will 
access more then 192GB of RAM or access more then two CPUs. the CPU 
isn't the problem but the RAM.  So since I have been a life long Windows 
user and my current Opensim setup I got running on my Windows 7, Home 
Premium 64bit I decided I would have to get Windows Server 2008. R2 Sp1 
already.

The problem I am having is they mention something called CALS, which I 
never heard of before.  It said a CAL is a Client Access Licenses and 
Management Licenses.  I am hoping it doesn't mean I have to pay a huge 
outrageous amount of money to get unlimited CALS or something so I can 
legally allow others to access my Opensim grid or something.

Does anyone know of if or how this effects me.  The CALS have anything 
to do with this kind of access.  I never dealt with the whole CALS thing 
before. Someone running Opensim on Windows Server 2008 R2 Sp1 might have 
some idea, I hope.

Thanks for your time.
InuYasha
