<PRE>Hey jokay,

- just recommended your grid to Lisa
I guess u are too slow :p

&gt;<i> HI Lisa and all,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Just sharing, as I thought it might be of interest...  we (at jokaydiaGRID)  actually developed a historical build with the History Teachers Association of Victoria last year! You can find out more about it here -  <A HREF="http://virtualhistorycentre.com/">http://virtualhistorycentre.com/</A> . Essentially the project focussed on making a virtual replica of the Point Nepean Quarantine Station in Victoria and additionally a museum which provides virtual worlds access to a range of research materials and resources for students to explore. There are also a number of quests built into the environment to encourage students to explore, reflect and recreate content to add to the build. You can view additional pictures of the here - <A HREF="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jokay/sets/72157631154100902/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/jokay/sets/72157631154100902/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunatey its had limited use so far because of the ongoing challenges of opening ports in educational environments in Australia (shake fist at firewall of doom), but it has had some limited use by students in Victoria and we're currently working on various Sim on a stick options et al. Additionally, we're hoping it will be open to the public via jokaydiaGRID very soon... will keep you posted! ;) 
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Chris,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for that! I'm pretty sure we already know each other, years ago at the FTI during the CADSAGAP course? Am I thinking of the right person? I was hoping I would run into some local people as I did my research on this! Yes, I definitely want to talk to people at UWA, I need some input from teachers and/or academics in this area. It helps that my father is both a science teacher and a computer programmer, so he's helping me out, but someone who has done more work on using virtual worlds in education would be very, very helpful for my application :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm definitely thinking of cross media, because I think focussing on 3D worldbuilding could become a bit of a distraction from actually learning, once you get past a certain point of complexity. I just want the virtual space to be a meeting place, and to help give context, kind of like a museum exhibition or a diorama representing a story from history. The rest of the story, and discussion about different historical sources, would be in more traditional text format, along with videos, photos, etc. I kind of imagine that each story within the virtual world would be accompanied by a discussion page the same way articles in Wikipedia are, where students can argue their case for why they believe the event happened in one particular way rather than another. There would of course be differences of opinion, maybe multiple accounts of the same event. But that's what history really is - the competition between different accounts and interpretations, not just a series of facts. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So it sounds like Moodle would be a great addition to this project! Thanks for suggesting it. I'm looking out for people I can add to my team, at least for the purposes of the application (you have to list your team members and have a two page CV for each one), so if you're available for that it could be a great help. If we then get funding you can see how much time you could put into consulting work for us.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi Lisa,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nice idea. There was a similar UWA educational research proposal for teaching ancient greek using opensim/SL. The idea was to immerse students in the culture of the time as well as communicate/learn in ancient greek. That one did not get funded but it may be a good idea to join forces with such educators and not only go for the ABC grant but also an ARC - industry linkage grant.  I can put you in contact with those ppl if interested.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Another link suggestion if you wish to meet educators is on the jokaydiagrid - a relatively inexpensive grid if you want to meet educators and learn at the same time- see:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://jokaydia.wikispaces.com/Edusquarelandmarks">http://jokaydia.wikispaces.com/Edusquarelandmarks</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Another thing to consider is sloodle: an integration of the open source Moodle educational course tools with SL sims. It has its limitations but does provide a good way to develop Web based courses with a sim. I suggest cross media is the best way to go - not just relying on opensim but do Web/sim/film/machinima - which it seems you are already thinking - am I right?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My main experience in this area is in SL and Moodle (both deparately and combined) but I am doing a little edu project in opensim too atm. Over the next year I plan to move stuff from SL to opensim so maybe I will meet you on a grid sometime :)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm very new to OpenSim and just signed up to this list to ask a few questions. Sorry if I come across as a bit of a newbie, although I've been studying OS for a few days and I have my own standalone grid up and running at home.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm putting together a proposal for this educational portal run by the ABC here in Australia:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.abc.net.au/learn/proposals.htm">http://www.abc.net.au/learn/proposals.htm</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My project is all about teaching history, the idea being that students and history classes could put together simple sims telling stories about the history of their own local area, linking them up with videos, photos, essays, etc (which you could hopefully launch from within the sim). Their sims would all be linked up in a hypergrid, so students from all over Australia (later maybe the world) could get into a virtual time machine and visit different places at different times, to see what was happening. Students would be able to chat with each other and show each other around their creations. Hopefully the act of collaborative world building would engage them in learning about history, but I would want them focussed on just telling small stories, involving a small number of characters (which would be created as NPCs if that's possible, with simple, looping animations if not more complex behaviour) and buildings, objects, etc. (I have ideas about how to source lots of 3D content, which I need to explore more). 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm sure none of this is an original idea, but it seems like a good opportunity to put an idea like this forward. I just was wondering if anyone could tell me whether it would work in OpenSim or if there are some big barriers to creating something like this.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My main issue right now is trying to work out how you create sims that represent not only a region in space but also a period in time. I've been thinking that I would have a grid that contains regions in which only stories from, say, 1950 to 2000 were created. Then another grid would represent the same real world area, but contain stories from 1900-1950. The further you go back in time, the longer the time intervals would get, along an approximately logarithmic scale, so if you were telling stories about the dinosaurs one grid would represent the entire Jurassic era, for example.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Would this be the right way to go? I've been reading about regions and grids and hypergrids but I'm pretty sure there's a lot I don't understand.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My own background is that I've been working in 3D animation for film, TV and games for the past decade, as a 3D all rounder and a technical artist. I've worked on one big MMO for three years that was never released. So I know about 3D modeling, animation, worldbuilding, etc. but I've never spent much time around Second Life or OpenSim, so a lot of this is new to me.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks for any help!
