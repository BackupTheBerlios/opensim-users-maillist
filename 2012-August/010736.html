<PRE>Hi Edmund,

Intrigued, I logged in with both Imprudence and the regular Second Life Viewer from LL. None managed to send postcards by email, and I get with both exactly the same error you get. I'm testing with OpenSim 0.7.4RC1. I can successfully replicate exactly what you have described: on 1.23.X-based viewers, the &quot;From&quot; email address can be filled, but it gets cleared/ignored. On 3.X viewers, you cannot even set that, so you just get the error and nothing else.

There seems to be something missing on the implementation, since the email address is clearly on the database, and I know it's correct since Offline IMs work fine and they use this address &#8212; so I know that the mail transport agent is working well and correctly configured.

If there are any &quot;special&quot; configuration on the simulator .ini files, I couldn't find any!

I filed a Mantis issue report on this, giving you due credit: <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=6151">http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=6151</A>

As a matter of fact, I remember having tested this out in very old versions &#8212; it never worked! &#8212; but I don't always have &quot;my&quot; grid correctly configured, so I discarded the issue as being a question of configuring OpenSim properly :-) Right now, however, I *know* that things are working, so this might be just something that was never properly implemented or was implemented correctly at some past date, and LL has changed the way the viewer(s) request the email address from the simulator, so now it just fails with that error.
