<PRE>Hi Justin,

Apologies for not updating the thread. The issue did indeed disappear 
for reasons unknown to me. The last thing I can remember trying before 
everything started working suddenly is editing one attachment and set 
scripts to running in selection; and then all my attachments started to 
work from there on. I have been unable to reproduce the issue since they 
started working. Will file a new mantis on it if I'm able to reproduce 
the issue again.

Thank you! =)
