<PRE>Akira, that's just my offline Workshop, so I'm the only one who logs into
it. My internet connection is via a mobility wireless and I have been
unable to locate the particular documentation to let me use it to run my
instance online. Its also a flex plan so it get to be expensive. I do hope
to change that at some point over the next few months. However, I do use it
to test all viewers for Misfit's Index of Viewers
<A HREF="http://excelsior-station.wikidot.com/misfit-s-index-of-viewers-miv">http://excelsior-station.wikidot.com/misfit-s-index-of-viewers-miv</A>
Currently, its been running steadily for about a week. I used to shut it
down overnight, though I'm not sure why. Just habit, I guess.

The whole setup is two computers as a LAN using ethernet connections. The
one I am using for server'side is a single-core LE-1620 64bit processor
with 4Gb RAM and two 150Gb harddrives running Windows7 Ultimate 64bit. For
the client'side I'm running an AMD quad-core A8-3820 64bit with 6Gb RAM and
a 150Tb harddrive that I have partitioned into a 1Tb and a 500Gb. Its
running Windows7 Premium 64bit.

I'm not running the regions as megaregions. This way is easier for saving
OARs fo the regions which is better for me as backups of my builds. 20 of
the regions are built with Kitely's upcoming enabling of megaregions in
mind and two are copies of my online instance Misfit's Folly. The balance
(6) are used for all my miscellaneous stuff, from buildings to steampunk to
sci-fi to general gadgetry. I have no idea of how many prims or scripts are
running. Also, each region is configured to allow a max of 100,000 prims. I
like to be sure.

Oh, and I'm in Canada. SE corner of British Columbia, though since I'm not
running it online that likely doesn't matter. And being just me, I guess
thread count isn't all that important, either. But, it says total number of
threads is 247 and I'm not logged in at the moment. The whole thing uses
Sim-on-a-Stick, which uses Diva's Distro configured for MOWES MySQL and
Apache server.

One thing about Firestorm. It uses something called a LSL&lt;&gt;Client Bridge.
That only works in SL. If you use it anywhere else, it downloads it, tries
to attach it, can't and drops it as an invisible and almost impossible to
grab prim. And Firestorm will try to use it. I recommend disabling it
through your Preferences. Firestrom Tab, General Heading, bottom of the
page. I've had no issues with Firestorm on any grid after doing that.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Go ahead and set those to localhost anyway. That works for me. I am

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> may get bold enough to set all the Cap_ to localhost, just to see what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> happens :-D Anyway, with all four of those set to localhost I see all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> textures and all mesh objects, my av and inventory loads without problems,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> other than with Kokua.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Nice!!! With how many Avatars simultaneously on the same region? 10, 20,
</I>&gt;<i> 30, 40 ??? With what combinations of viewers? And how long? 1 hr 2 hours, 3
</I>&gt;<i> hours? How many logins do you have through that time? What was the average
</I>&gt;<i> Thread count with 20 Avatars?
</I>&gt;<i> What was the maximum Thread count with 20 Avatars and how long were your
</I>&gt;<i> slowest requests? Where is your server located (Europe?)? and where are the
</I>&gt;<i> grid Servers located(California?)?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have done some Tests on Windows 2008 Servers and it slightly runs better
</I>&gt;<i> ... but it is not worth the microsoft tax of 20 euros per month per server.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On regions with 1 to 3 avatars simultaneously i have no issues with those
</I>&gt;<i> caps ( as long as I am not using my Avatar together with Firestorm, all
</I>&gt;<i> other avaters run quite nicely ). But 1 to 3 Avatars is not my concern. 20
</I>&gt;<i> to 40 avatars have to be able to stay simultaneously on one sim/region for
</I>&gt;<i> hours ( i only have sims with one region ).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Take care
