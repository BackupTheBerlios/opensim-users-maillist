<PRE>I have recently compiled commit 374ebab (r/20015) and am noticing that 
scripts in attachments are not responding. The scripts are loading as 
per server output but they seem 'frozen' and unresponsive in world in 
every way.

Tried a few things to resolve (in no particular order) :

1. Detach and reattach affected objects
2. Delete ScriptEngines directory in bin
3. Clear SL cache (deleted cache directory completely)
4. Delete assetcache directory in bin
5. Reset scripts in affected objects
6. Relog several times

The only thing that I can tell that fixes it is to completely recompile 
all the scripts in the attachments.

This only seems to affect attachments and scripts that were made before 
the commit that introduced this issue. Newly made attachments and 
scripts after that commit don't exhibit this behavior. Scripted objects 
rezzed on the ground seem to function as well.

I am not sure which commit this started happening in but I was able to 
revert back to commit 337ea01 (r/19717) and everything is working fine 
scripted attachment-wise. So somewhere between 19718 and master is when 
it starts to happen I assume.

Is anyone else having this issue?

Thanks! =)
