<PRE>Hello Sarge,

2012/8/14 Sarge Misfit &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-users">fubat.enterprises at gmail.com</A>&gt;

&gt;<i> Go ahead and set those to localhost anyway. That works for me. I am
</I>&gt;<i> running Win7 64bit on both of my computers. From what I understand,
</I>&gt;<i> Descendents2 and Inventory2 was introduced somewhere between V2 and V3.
</I>&gt;<i> Setting those to localhost resolved my own Inventory issues. In fact, every
</I>&gt;<i> Cap_ that refers to Inventory I've set to localhost without any problem. I
</I>&gt;<i> may get bold enough to set all the Cap_ to localhost, just to see what
</I>&gt;<i> happens :-D Anyway, with all four of those set to localhost I see all
</I>&gt;<i> textures and all mesh objects, my av and inventory loads without problems,
</I>&gt;<i> other than with Kokua.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Nice!!! With how many Avatars simultaneously on the same region? 10, 20,
30, 40 ??? With what combinations of viewers? And how long? 1 hr 2 hours, 3
hours? How many logins do you have through that time? What was the average
Thread count with 20 Avatars?
What was the maximum Thread count with 20 Avatars and how long were your
slowest requests? Where is your server located (Europe?)? and where are the
grid Servers located(California?)?

I have done some Tests on Windows 2008 Servers and it slightly runs better
... but it is not worth the microsoft tax of 20 euros per month per server.

On regions with 1 to 3 avatars simultaneously i have no issues with those
caps ( as long as I am not using my Avatar together with Firestorm, all
other avaters run quite nicely ). But 1 to 3 Avatars is not my concern. 20
to 40 avatars have to be able to stay simultaneously on one sim/region for
hours ( i only have sims with one region ).

Take care
Akira
