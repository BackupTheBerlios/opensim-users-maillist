<PRE>Access challenges very much varies from State to State, and I can happily
report things are getting a little easier as edu departments begin to
finally embrace virtual worlds and games a little more eg. tafe projects
like Virtual Enterprise @ jokaydiaGRID and the PLANE project - a NSW PD
program for teachers which includes some opensim. However it is still
probably the big risk factor to consider. The other is hardware..there are
alot of year 9 laptops out there that WILL NOT run opensim. ;(

Having said that, things are much easier in VIC than NSW or QLD, but still
a bit of a challenge. Solving port issues via viewer dev would indeed be a
huge win, but a big challenge considering how wedded to port 80 and
powerpoint alot edu IT departments are! ;) I also suspect that options for
running it on SOAS or a local school server would also be very valuable.

regards,
jokay

</I>&gt;<i>  Just sharing, as I thought it might be of interest...  we (at
</I>&gt;<i> jokaydiaGRID)  actually developed a historical build with the History
</I>&gt;<i> Teachers Association of Victoria last year! You can find out more about it
</I>&gt;<i> here -  <A HREF="http://virtualhistorycentre.com/">http://virtualhistorycentre.com/</A> . Essentially the project
</I>&gt;<i> focussed on making a virtual replica of the Point Nepean Quarantine Station
</I>&gt;<i> in Victoria and additionally a museum which provides virtual worlds access
</I>&gt;<i> to a range of research materials and resources for students to explore.
</I>&gt;<i> There are also a number of quests built into the environment to encourage
</I>&gt;<i> students to explore, reflect and recreate content to add to the build. You
</I>&gt;<i> can view additional pictures of the here -

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Unfortunatey its had limited use so far because of the ongoing
</I>&gt;<i> challenges of opening ports in educational environments in Australia (shake
</I>&gt;<i> fist at firewall of doom), but it has had some limited use by students in
</I>&gt;<i> Victoria and we're currently working on various Sim on a stick options et
</I>&gt;<i> al. Additionally, we're hoping it will be open to the public via
</I>&gt;<i> jokaydiaGRID very soon... will keep you posted! ;)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Hi Chris,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks for that! I'm pretty sure we already know each other, years ago at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the FTI during the CADSAGAP course? Am I thinking of the right person? I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> was hoping I would run into some local people as I did my research on this!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, I definitely want to talk to people at UWA, I need some input from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> teachers and/or academics in this area. It helps that my father is both a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> science teacher and a computer programmer, so he's helping me out, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> someone who has done more work on using virtual worlds in education would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be very, very helpful for my application :)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm definitely thinking of cross media, because I think focussing on 3D
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> worldbuilding could become a bit of a distraction from actually learning,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> once you get past a certain point of complexity. I just want the virtual
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> space to be a meeting place, and to help give context, kind of like a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> museum exhibition or a diorama representing a story from history. The rest
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of the story, and discussion about different historical sources, would be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in more traditional text format, along with videos, photos, etc. I kind of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> imagine that each story within the virtual world would be accompanied by a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> discussion page the same way articles in Wikipedia are, where students can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> argue their case for why they believe the event happened in one particular
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> way rather than another. There would of course be differences of opinion,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> maybe multiple accounts of the same event. But that's what history really
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is - the competition between different accounts and interpretations, not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> just a series of facts.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So it sounds like Moodle would be a great addition to this project!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks for suggesting it. I'm looking out for people I can add to my team,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> at least for the purposes of the application (you have to list your team
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> members and have a two page CV for each one), so if you're available for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that it could be a great help. If we then get funding you can see how much
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> time you could put into consulting work for us.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi Lisa,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  nice idea. There was a similar UWA educational research proposal for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> teaching ancient greek using opensim/SL. The idea was to immerse students
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in the culture of the time as well as communicate/learn in ancient greek.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That one did not get funded but it may be a good idea to join forces with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> such educators and not only go for the ABC grant but also an ARC - industry
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> linkage grant.  I can put you in contact with those ppl if interested.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Another link suggestion if you wish to meet educators is on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> jokaydiagrid - a relatively inexpensive grid if you want to meet educators
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and learn at the same time- see:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://jokaydia.wikispaces.com/Edusquarelandmarks">http://jokaydia.wikispaces.com/Edusquarelandmarks</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Another thing to consider is sloodle: an integration of the open source
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Moodle educational course tools with SL sims. It has its limitations but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> does provide a good way to develop Web based courses with a sim. I suggest
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cross media is the best way to go - not just relying on opensim but do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Web/sim/film/machinima - which it seems you are already thinking - am I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> right?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  My main experience in this area is in SL and Moodle (both deparately
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and combined) but I am doing a little edu project in opensim too atm. Over
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the next year I plan to move stuff from SL to opensim so maybe I will meet
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you on a grid sometime :)

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  Hi all,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I'm very new to OpenSim and just signed up to this list to ask a few
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> questions. Sorry if I come across as a bit of a newbie, although I've been
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> studying OS for a few days and I have my own standalone grid up and running
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> at home.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I'm putting together a proposal for this educational portal run by the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ABC here in Australia:

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> My project is all about teaching history, the idea being that students
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and history classes could put together simple sims telling stories about
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the history of their own local area, linking them up with videos, photos,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> essays, etc (which you could hopefully launch from within the sim). Their
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> sims would all be linked up in a hypergrid, so students from all over
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Australia (later maybe the world) could get into a virtual time machine and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> visit different places at different times, to see what was happening.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Students would be able to chat with each other and show each other around
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> their creations. Hopefully the act of collaborative world building would
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> engage them in learning about history, but I would want them focussed on
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> just telling small stories, involving a small number of characters (which
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> would be created as NPCs if that's possible, with simple, looping
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> animations if not more complex behaviour) and buildings, objects, etc. (I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> have ideas about how to source lots of 3D content, which I need to explore
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> more).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I'm sure none of this is an original idea, but it seems like a good
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> opportunity to put an idea like this forward. I just was wondering if
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> anyone could tell me whether it would work in OpenSim or if there are some
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> big barriers to creating something like this.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> My main issue right now is trying to work out how you create sims that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> represent not only a region in space but also a period in time. I've been
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> thinking that I would have a grid that contains regions in which only
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> stories from, say, 1950 to 2000 were created. Then another grid would
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> represent the same real world area, but contain stories from 1900-1950. The
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> further you go back in time, the longer the time intervals would get, along
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> an approximately logarithmic scale, so if you were telling stories about
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the dinosaurs one grid would represent the entire Jurassic era, for example.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Would this be the right way to go? I've been reading about regions and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> grids and hypergrids but I'm pretty sure there's a lot I don't understand.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> My own background is that I've been working in 3D animation for film, TV
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and games for the past decade, as a 3D all rounder and a technical artist.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I've worked on one big MMO for three years that was never released. So I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> know about 3D modeling, animation, worldbuilding, etc. but I've never spent
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> much time around Second Life or OpenSim, so a lot of this is new to me.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks for any help!
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Cheers,
