<PRE>I've recently compiled master a couple days ago (r/20170) and am 
noticing some strangeness when attempting to load IAR files.

Once the IAR is set up to be loaded it will give an error message 
saying: &quot;[XINVENTORY]: System folder of type -1 already exists when 
tried to add &lt;folder name here&gt; to 7a4aa304-f63b-4724-a697-f1b3edb5e105 
for 3557bf78-5e34-4e6c-b37c-2a5a8527e3e2&quot; and then proceed to load the 
directory structure and assets.

Once this happens if I try to create a new folder it will give me this 
message in the console: &quot;[AGENT INVENTORY]: Failed to create folder for 
user mewtwo0641 Alito 3557bf78-5e34-4e6c-b37c-2a5a8527e3e2&quot; and an 
attempt to delete the folder will result in a message saying &quot;[AGENT 
INVENTORY]: request to move folder 7e4317db-fbe0-a960-a92a-f259cd4c85d0 
but folder not found&quot;

Upon relog, the folders that the IAR should have created are not there, 
and instead random folders and their content from the IAR file are now 
located outside of the My Inventory folder. So I'd end up with something 
resembling this at the very top directory:

Some random folder 1
Some random folder 2
My Inventory
     -- Some of the IAR load could be here or might not be
OpenSim Library
Some random folder 3

At this point the inventory seems partially corrupted and I am no longer 
able to make any new folders without receiving the errors that the 
folder can't be found, or get rid of the folders that appear outside of 
My Inventory. Cache clears (both SL cache and /bin cache folders), 
relogging, and server restarts didn't seem to make the issue go away. 
Only way I could see to fix it was to restore from a recent database backup.

To test it, I restored my database backup and decided to try loading a 
different known working IAR and got the same results. After which, I 
restored my database again and reverted to a slightly older OpenSim 
commit (r/20019) and the IARs load fine with no errors and no inventory 
weirdness.

Is anyone else experiencing this?

Thanks!
