<PRE>Hi Lisa, and welcome to the MetaVerse.

While my own tastes run to future tech sci-fi, I can tell you that there
are others who have and are building historical and geographical
recreations. Research is going to be your biggest job right now. And there
are lots of resources. Check out HyperGrid Business
<A HREF="http://www.hypergridbusiness.com/">http://www.hypergridbusiness.com/</A> Maria has a lot of resources listed in
various articles. Ener Hax at <A HREF="http://iliveisl.com/">http://iliveisl.com/</A> is building Enclave
Harbour which will be used to conduct virtual field trips for students. She
blogs daily on a wide variety of things. On my site, Excelsior
Station&lt;<A HREF="http://excelsior-station.wikidot.com/">http://excelsior-station.wikidot.com/</A>&gt;,
I have lists of bloggers, content providers and more, though they are not
comprehensive. Its just a place to start.

And you can pretty well count on others responding with help, too.

Good luck

Sarge

&gt;<i>  Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm very new to OpenSim and just signed up to this list to ask a few
</I>&gt;<i> questions. Sorry if I come across as a bit of a newbie, although I've been
</I>&gt;<i> studying OS for a few days and I have my own standalone grid up and running
</I>&gt;<i> at home.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm putting together a proposal for this educational portal run by the ABC
</I>&gt;<i> here in Australia:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.abc.net.au/learn/proposals.htm">http://www.abc.net.au/learn/proposals.htm</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My project is all about teaching history, the idea being that students and
</I>&gt;<i> history classes could put together simple sims telling stories about the
</I>&gt;<i> history of their own local area, linking them up with videos, photos,
</I>&gt;<i> essays, etc (which you could hopefully launch from within the sim). Their
</I>&gt;<i> sims would all be linked up in a hypergrid, so students from all over
</I>&gt;<i> Australia (later maybe the world) could get into a virtual time machine and
</I>&gt;<i> visit different places at different times, to see what was happening.
</I>&gt;<i> Students would be able to chat with each other and show each other around
</I>&gt;<i> their creations. Hopefully the act of collaborative world building would
</I>&gt;<i> engage them in learning about history, but I would want them focussed on
</I>&gt;<i> just telling small stories, involving a small number of characters (which
</I>&gt;<i> would be created as NPCs if that's possible, with simple, looping
</I>&gt;<i> animations if not more complex behaviour) and buildings, objects, etc. (I
</I>&gt;<i> have ideas about how to source lots of 3D content, which I need to explore
</I>&gt;<i> more).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm sure none of this is an original idea, but it seems like a good
</I>&gt;<i> opportunity to put an idea like this forward. I just was wondering if
</I>&gt;<i> anyone could tell me whether it would work in OpenSim or if there are some
</I>&gt;<i> big barriers to creating something like this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My main issue right now is trying to work out how you create sims that
</I>&gt;<i> represent not only a region in space but also a period in time. I've been
</I>&gt;<i> thinking that I would have a grid that contains regions in which only
</I>&gt;<i> stories from, say, 1950 to 2000 were created. Then another grid would
</I>&gt;<i> represent the same real world area, but contain stories from 1900-1950. The
</I>&gt;<i> further you go back in time, the longer the time intervals would get, along
</I>&gt;<i> an approximately logarithmic scale, so if you were telling stories about
</I>&gt;<i> the dinosaurs one grid would represent the entire Jurassic era, for example.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Would this be the right way to go? I've been reading about regions and
</I>&gt;<i> grids and hypergrids but I'm pretty sure there's a lot I don't understand.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My own background is that I've been working in 3D animation for film, TV
</I>&gt;<i> and games for the past decade, as a 3D all rounder and a technical artist.
</I>&gt;<i> I've worked on one big MMO for three years that was never released. So I
</I>&gt;<i> know about 3D modeling, animation, worldbuilding, etc. but I've never spent
</I>&gt;<i> much time around Second Life or OpenSim, so a lot of this is new to me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for any help!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i>
