<PRE>This is actually the kind of thing I was imagining we would do. First of 
all divide the grids up by historical eras, but within an era there 
would still be a lot of jumble, with different stories happening in the 
same spot at different times with the same buildings but people wearing 
different kinds of clothes and so on. I envisioned that you should be 
able to work out what date you want to visit, and only load the stories 
that are current at that date, with &quot;permanent&quot; structures always 
loading. I'm glad you suggested that independently of me bringing it up :)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Subject: [Opensim-users] Some questions about recreating history in OpenSim
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm very new to OpenSim and just signed up to this list to ask a few
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> questions. Sorry if I come across as a bit of a newbie, although I've been
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> studying OS for a few days and I have my own standalone grid up and running
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> at home.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm putting together a proposal for this educational portal run by the ABC
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> here in Australia:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.abc.net.au/learn/proposals.htm">http://www.abc.net.au/learn/proposals.htm</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My project is all about teaching history, the idea being that students and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> history classes could put together simple sims telling stories about the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> history of their own local area, linking them up with videos, photos,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> essays, etc (which you could hopefully launch from within the sim). Their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sims would all be linked up in a hypergrid, so students from all over
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Australia (later maybe the world) could get into a virtual time machine and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> visit different places at different times, to see what was happening.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Students would be able to chat with each other and show each other around
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their creations. Hopefully the act of collaborative world building would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> engage them in learning about history, but I would want them focussed on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> just telling small stories, involving a small number of characters (which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would be created as NPCs if that's possible, with simple, looping animations
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if not more complex behaviour) and buildings, objects, etc. (I have ideas
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about how to source lots of 3D content, which I need to explore more).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm sure none of this is an original idea, but it seems like a good
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> opportunity to put an idea like this forward. I just was wondering if anyone
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could tell me whether it would work in OpenSim or if there are some big
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> barriers to creating something like this.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My main issue right now is trying to work out how you create sims that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> represent not only a region in space but also a period in time. I've been
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thinking that I would have a grid that contains regions in which only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stories from, say, 1950 to 2000 were created. Then another grid would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> represent the same real world area, but contain stories from 1900-1950. The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> further you go back in time, the longer the time intervals would get, along
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> an approximately logarithmic scale, so if you were telling stories about the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dinosaurs one grid would represent the entire Jurassic era, for example.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Would this be the right way to go? I've been reading about regions and grids
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and hypergrids but I'm pretty sure there's a lot I don't understand.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My own background is that I've been working in 3D animation for film, TV and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> games for the past decade, as a 3D all rounder and a technical artist. I've
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> worked on one big MMO for three years that was never released. So I know
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about 3D modeling, animation, worldbuilding, etc. but I've never spent much
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> time around Second Life or OpenSim, so a lot of this is new to me.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks for any help!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
