<PRE>Hi Lisa,

nice idea. There was a similar UWA educational research proposal for
teaching ancient greek using opensim/SL. The idea was to immerse students
in the culture of the time as well as communicate/learn in ancient greek.
That one did not get funded but it may be a good idea to join forces with
such educators and not only go for the ABC grant but also an ARC - industry
linkage grant.  I can put you in contact with those ppl if interested.

Another link suggestion if you wish to meet educators is on the
jokaydiagrid - a relatively inexpensive grid if you want to meet educators
and learn at the same time- see:
<A HREF="http://jokaydia.wikispaces.com/Edusquarelandmarks">http://jokaydia.wikispaces.com/Edusquarelandmarks</A>

Another thing to consider is sloodle: an integration of the open source
Moodle educational course tools with SL sims. It has its limitations but
does provide a good way to develop Web based courses with a sim. I suggest
cross media is the best way to go - not just relying on opensim but do
Web/sim/film/machinima - which it seems you are already thinking - am I
right?

My main experience in this area is in SL and Moodle (both deparately and
combined) but I am doing a little edu project in opensim too atm. Over the
next year I plan to move stuff from SL to opensim so maybe I will meet you
on a grid sometime :)

cheers,

chris

&gt;<i>  Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm very new to OpenSim and just signed up to this list to ask a few
</I>&gt;<i> questions. Sorry if I come across as a bit of a newbie, although I've been
</I>&gt;<i> studying OS for a few days and I have my own standalone grid up and running
</I>&gt;<i> at home.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm putting together a proposal for this educational portal run by the ABC

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.abc.net.au/learn/proposals.htm">http://www.abc.net.au/learn/proposals.htm</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My project is all about teaching history, the idea being that students and
</I>&gt;<i> history classes could put together simple sims telling stories about the
</I>&gt;<i> history of their own local area, linking them up with videos, photos,
</I>&gt;<i> essays, etc (which you could hopefully launch from within the sim). Their
</I>&gt;<i> sims would all be linked up in a hypergrid, so students from all over
</I>&gt;<i> Australia (later maybe the world) could get into a virtual time machine and
</I>&gt;<i> visit different places at different times, to see what was happening.
</I>&gt;<i> Students would be able to chat with each other and show each other around
</I>&gt;<i> their creations. Hopefully the act of collaborative world building would
</I>&gt;<i> engage them in learning about history, but I would want them focussed on
</I>&gt;<i> just telling small stories, involving a small number of characters (which
</I>&gt;<i> would be created as NPCs if that's possible, with simple, looping
</I>&gt;<i> animations if not more complex behaviour) and buildings, objects, etc. (I
</I>&gt;<i> have ideas about how to source lots of 3D content, which I need to explore
</I>&gt;<i> more).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm sure none of this is an original idea, but it seems like a good
</I>&gt;<i> opportunity to put an idea like this forward. I just was wondering if
</I>&gt;<i> anyone could tell me whether it would work in OpenSim or if there are some
</I>&gt;<i> big barriers to creating something like this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My main issue right now is trying to work out how you create sims that
</I>&gt;<i> represent not only a region in space but also a period in time. I've been
</I>&gt;<i> thinking that I would have a grid that contains regions in which only
</I>&gt;<i> stories from, say, 1950 to 2000 were created. Then another grid would
</I>&gt;<i> represent the same real world area, but contain stories from 1900-1950. The
</I>&gt;<i> further you go back in time, the longer the time intervals would get, along
</I>&gt;<i> an approximately logarithmic scale, so if you were telling stories about
</I>&gt;<i> the dinosaurs one grid would represent the entire Jurassic era, for example.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Would this be the right way to go? I've been reading about regions and
</I>&gt;<i> grids and hypergrids but I'm pretty sure there's a lot I don't understand.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My own background is that I've been working in 3D animation for film, TV
</I>&gt;<i> and games for the past decade, as a 3D all rounder and a technical artist.
</I>&gt;<i> I've worked on one big MMO for three years that was never released. So I
</I>&gt;<i> know about 3D modeling, animation, worldbuilding, etc. but I've never spent
</I>&gt;<i> much time around Second Life or OpenSim, so a lot of this is new to me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for any help!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i>
