<PRE>Thanks for this Justin. I do understand the complexities very much! But 
there's definitely not enough in the budget to build something like this 
from the ground up, so starting with a project that already exists is 
the only way forward.  From my research, I think if it can't be done in 
OpenSim at this stage, then it can't really be done yet, and I might 
have to put the idea away for a few more years :)

This is all that's left of the MMO I worked on, by the way - 
<A HREF="http://www.onlinesoccerchampions.com/">http://www.onlinesoccerchampions.com/</A> . I helped to script tools in 3DS 
Max to streamline content creation, integrated all the clothing (there 
was a lot of it), created the crowds in the stadiums, made the roads in 
the virtual world look as seamless as possible, and did lots of other 
odd jobs. Plus wrote a huge amount of documentation about our art 
pipelines. I'd love to get stuck into doing something like that again, 
especially for an educational project that I would care about far more 
than a sport game :P

</I>&gt;<i> I just want to make sure that you're aware that OpenSimulator is still 
</I>&gt;<i> a platform in its infancy (as is the whole area of educating via 
</I>&gt;<i> shared environments, I think).  Therefore, there are still a large 
</I>&gt;<i> number of unexploded bugs, missing features and performance issues 
</I>&gt;<i> around, though OpenSimulator continues to improve over time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm also sure as a previous MMO developer that you're aware of just 
</I>&gt;<i> how complicated these platforms can get and the aspects of ongoing 
</I>&gt;<i> maintenance costs, cost of content creation, etc., though I would say 
</I>&gt;<i> that aspects of these are vastly cheaper on OpenSimulator than on 
</I>&gt;<i> other exclusively commercial-oriented platforms, both self-hosted and 
</I>&gt;<i> with third-party providers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Having said all that, I think we're just at the point where some very 
</I>&gt;<i> interesting things can be done and there are many educational 
</I>&gt;<i> institutions already involved/experimenting with OpenSimulator (e.g. 
</I>&gt;<i> PLANE [1], New Worlds run by the Chester County Intermediate Unit [2], 
</I>&gt;<i> ScienceSim from Intel [3] and lots of others).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would also urge that anybody considering funding viewer development 
</I>&gt;<i> talk to the existing viewer projects first before forking.  These are 
</I>&gt;<i> produced by people who have already shown a long term passion for 
</I>&gt;<i> exploring the virtual world/shared environment space and it would be 
</I>&gt;<i> great to see sustainable projects catering to OpenSimulator in this 
</I>&gt;<i> area).

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi Maria,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks for all this information. I should have written more about the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> scheme I am writing a proposal for, rather than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> just link to it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If this proposal is successful, the project will be funded up to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> $400,000 AU over three years, (and hopefully more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> funding after that, but otherwise we would have to find another 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> source). Also, projects funded under this scheme have to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be free for educational use within Australia, and they have to make 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> use of the National Broadband Network, which is the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> very high speed broadband network our government is building 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Australia wide. Part of the reason for the education portal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is to show it off and justify the expense!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So the only hosting solution that would fit all the requirements 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would be to build our own servers locally, so we get
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the highest speed possible under the NBN. And we could afford to pay 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the programmers/tech heads needed to set the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hosting up, and run it for at least three years.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The project I have in mind is a bit bigger than just what OpenSim can 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> provide under normal circumstances, and we would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> want to maybe fork one of the viewers out there and add some new 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> features to it, using part of the budget. Hopefully
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what I'm intending would be useful to other educators and if the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> project wasn't funded beyond the three years, the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> development of the new viewer would continue (of course it would all 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be open source). The features we would add would be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> specific to teaching history through virtual worlds, and teaching in 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> general.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So I would love to talk to someone about my original questions 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> regarding structuring historical sims that exist not just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in three dimensional space but also back and forth along a timeline. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I've studied a fair bit of general relativity back
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> when I was doing my physics degree, so I can kind of handle thinking 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in four dimensions, but this is still a bit tricky,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> lol.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Lisa --
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Here are my recommendations, in order of difficulty:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 1. Easiest and cheapest: go to <A HREF="http://www.kitely.com">http://www.kitely.com</A> and sign up for 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the free six-hour introductory month, which comes
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> with a free region. You will be asked to download a small plugin, 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> then it will automatically install a viewer for you,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> create your region, and take you in-world. Easy, peasy. You can 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> practice building, or upload any of the OARs available
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> free to educators to start with.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Check out: 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.hypergridbusiness.com/2011/06/where-to-get-content-for-opensim/">http://www.hypergridbusiness.com/2011/06/where-to-get-content-for-opensim/</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If you like it, $35 a month gives you unlimited use of Kitely, plus 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 20 (twenty!) regions. You can add extra regions
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> for just $1 a month each. Each region can hold up to 100,000 prims 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and up to 100 simultaneous visitors. (No kidding!
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> They run it in the Amazon cloud and the scaling is excellent.) For 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> educators, it's the single best deal out there.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Here's the downside: your visitors will get two hours a month free 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (six hours the first month) but after that they
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> either have to sign up for a plan or pay 20 cents an hour for usage. 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Or you can opt to pay for their usage.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Let's compare this to the Second Life deal, with $300 a month per 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> region, and a $1,000 setup fee. For the $300 you can
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> have something like eight users with unlimited use accounts (you, a 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> couple of fellow teachers, the students doing the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> heavy building) and 8x20=160 regions and you can put the $1,000 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> you'd otherwise spend for a setup fee towards 300,000
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> minutes worth of access time for visitors.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If you ever want to leave Kitely for any reason, you can export your 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> entire regions (terrains, objects, scripts,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> everything on them that you have rights to) with a single click, and 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> import them to anywhere else you want in a couple
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> of minutes. They have Vivox voice (the same as Second Life), mesh, 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> media-on-a-prim (to put interactive Web pages and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> videos on in-world surfaces) and megaregions. The only thing that's 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> missing is hypergrid, and that's coming with the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> next hypergrid security update. They also have bots -- aka NPCs 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (non-player characters) -- which you can use to create
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> robots that simulate historical characters and interact with your 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> visitors.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 2. Easy, a bit less cheap, but more options: go to Dreamland 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Metaverse (<A HREF="http://www.dreamlandmetaverse.com/">http://www.dreamlandmetaverse.com/</A>) or one of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the other vendors in our hosting directory: 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.hypergridbusiness.com/opensim-hosting-providers/">http://www.hypergridbusiness.com/opensim-hosting-providers/</A> I 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> particularly
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> mention Dreamland because they have an excellent reputation with 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> educators, all the latest OpenSim features, and are
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> currently running the grids for a school district in suburban 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Atlanta. They can set you up with a private grid, or
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> land on any of the open grids out there, including OSGrid. They can 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> set it up so your teachers can hypergrid teleport
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to other grids, and your students can't. They can automatically 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> create user accounts for all your students and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> teachers at once -- and there's lot of other custom stuff they can 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> do, as well. They have moderate prices -- they're
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> not the most expensive by far, nor the cheapest, but have a good 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> reputation for reliability and service. And whle
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Kitely regions are only up when people are on them, and are put to 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> sleep otherwise, Dreamland regions are up 24-7.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> While this means higher prices, it also means that visitors don't 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> have to wait for a region to boot up when they first
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> teleport to a sleeping region, which can take a minute.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 3. Not easy at all, but free. You can run your own grids on your own 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> servers. You will have to set up a MySQL
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> database, and an Apache server, and the OpenSim server, and keep all 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> of those patched and updated and regularly backed
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> up. The easiest way to do that is to use New World Studio -- 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://nws.virrea.fr/">http://nws.virrea.fr/</A> --  which installs all of those for
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> you automatically. You will still have to learn how to use the 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> OpenSim management console, however, and, unless you
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> hire a consultant, if you want to manage users or inventories or 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> terrains or OAR files you will often have to go to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the server console and type in server commands. The commands are 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> here, to give you a taste:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Server_Commands">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Server_Commands</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If all your visitors are local -- behind your school firewall -- 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> then this will give you the fastest possible
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> connections, since the OpenSim grid will be hosted right where the 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> visitors are. Some of the OpenSim hosting companies
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> will do by-the-hour consulting for you, helping you set up your 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> first grid and installing and configuring routers and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> viewers and all that other messy stuff. And you can have as many 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> regions, prims and simultaneous visitors as your
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> network can bear -- which could be quite a lot, depending on your 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> infrastructure. And if you want to allow remote
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> logins, or hypergrid travel to and from other grids, you will need 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to configure it for hypergrid connectivity, and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> punch a hole in your network's firewall to allow the traffic to go 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> through.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Feel free to contact me directly if you have any additional questions!
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Best,
