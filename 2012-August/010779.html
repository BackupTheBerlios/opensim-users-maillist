<PRE>Thanks for the warm welcome :). I will check out the Educators list as well.

</I>&gt;<i> My first suggestion (if you haven't already done so) is to sign up 
</I>&gt;<i> with an OpenSim grid and begin exploring.  My personal recommendation 
</I>&gt;<i> would be OSGrid (<A HREF="http://www.osgrid.org/">http://www.osgrid.org/</A>). It's the largest and oldest 
</I>&gt;<i> and has a wide variety of established regions to visit.  It's also the 
</I>&gt;<i> main testing grid for OpenSim users and developers so pretty much 
</I>&gt;<i> anyone who knows anything about OS is there at one time or another.  
</I>&gt;<i> There are many helpful people around who can give you advice and help 
</I>&gt;<i> get you started.  Ther are also tons of freebies and building tools 
</I>&gt;<i> there too ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sarge's links are also a great place to start.  Excelsior Station and 
</I>&gt;<i> Enclave Harbour are two of the most ambitious and impressive 
</I>&gt;<i> undertakings in OpenSim at the moment.  Good examples of just how far 
</I>&gt;<i> you can take your ideas and apply them effectively.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is also a sister mailing list to this one aimed at educators 
</I>&gt;<i> which is populated by many of the same users here. The info:
</I>&gt;<i> Education mailing list

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Hi all,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     I'm very new to OpenSim and just signed up to this list to ask a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     few questions. Sorry if I come across as a bit of a newbie,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     although I've been studying OS for a few days and I have my own
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     standalone grid up and running at home.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     I'm putting together a proposal for this educational portal run
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     by the ABC here in Australia:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     <A HREF="http://www.abc.net.au/learn/proposals.htm">http://www.abc.net.au/learn/proposals.htm</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     My project is all about teaching history, the idea being that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     students and history classes could put together simple sims
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     telling stories about the history of their own local area,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     linking them up with videos, photos, essays, etc (which you could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     hopefully launch from within the sim). Their sims would all be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     linked up in a hypergrid, so students from all over Australia
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     (later maybe the world) could get into a virtual time machine and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     visit different places at different times, to see what was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     happening. Students would be able to chat with each other and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     show each other around their creations. Hopefully the act of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     collaborative world building would engage them in learning about
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     history, but I would want them focussed on just telling small
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     stories, involving a small number of characters (which would be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     created as NPCs if that's possible, with simple, looping
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     animations if not more complex behaviour) and buildings, objects,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     etc. (I have ideas about how to source lots of 3D content, which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     I need to explore more).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     I'm sure none of this is an original idea, but it seems like a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     good opportunity to put an idea like this forward. I just was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     wondering if anyone could tell me whether it would work in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     OpenSim or if there are some big barriers to creating something
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     like this.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     My main issue right now is trying to work out how you create sims
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     that represent not only a region in space but also a period in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     time. I've been thinking that I would have a grid that contains
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     regions in which only stories from, say, 1950 to 2000 were
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     created. Then another grid would represent the same real world
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     area, but contain stories from 1900-1950. The further you go back
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     in time, the longer the time intervals would get, along an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     approximately logarithmic scale, so if you were telling stories
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     about the dinosaurs one grid would represent the entire Jurassic
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     era, for example.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Would this be the right way to go? I've been reading about
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     regions and grids and hypergrids but I'm pretty sure there's a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     lot I don't understand.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     My own background is that I've been working in 3D animation for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     film, TV and games for the past decade, as a 3D all rounder and a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     technical artist. I've worked on one big MMO for three years that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     was never released. So I know about 3D modeling, animation,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     worldbuilding, etc. but I've never spent much time around Second
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Life or OpenSim, so a lot of this is new to me.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Thanks for any help!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Cheers,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
