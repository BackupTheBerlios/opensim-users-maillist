<PRE>The log messages here are unfortunately misleading. The real error is &quot;Failed
to get part&quot;, and it happened because the prim has an invalid Particle
System. I'm somewhat responsible, since I'm the one that added support for
particle systems to UuidGatherer... That wasn't present in OpenSim 0.7.4,
which is why you didn't see these error messages then (but you didn't get
the particle system's texture saved in the OAR, either).

The message that says &quot;Texture entry length for prim was {0} (min is 46)&quot; is
always printed whenever *any* problem happens, but it's not actually an
error. This message should be removed.

So to summarize, there are two changes that should be made here:
1) Add a try/catch around the code that parses the ParticleSystem, and if
that fails just log a warning and continue, since the rest of the prim is
fine.
2) Remove the message that says &quot;Texture entry length for prim was {0} (min
is 46)&quot;. It's not really useful.

I would do this myself, but I'm very busy right now and it would take a long
time before I can submit a patch for this.
