<PRE>I do have the griefer's UUID...

though I am sure that is one of many identities and will already be 
different now.

I think the objects must be coming from an emitter placed somewhere 
perhaps high... Then spawning physical objects at a high rate which 
themselves probably are also cloned emitters, and the physical 
objects roll over the terrain getting to low points.   That is why 
many end up at the edge.  But they do not seem to stop at the edge 
they go slightly over and that causes problems.  I am using 
BulletSim, so that would seem to be worth considering as a BulletSim 
bug.  BulletSim should never allow a movement that makes the object 
appear at an illegal location that is not considered in the region by 
viewers (though they are left in the object count of the 
region).  The objects pile up one on top of another at this edge.. See
