Yes, either objects need to be prevented from getting to these locations or they should be considered to be in the 
nearest land parcel, I would say.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. When I thought I had tidied this all up, I found my grid data base had grown 50% (that means many extra GB of assets
</I>&gt;<i> as each was defined by a &quot;Blob&quot;) and the MySQL assets table still had 8000+ of the griefers objects in it, and was still
</I>&gt;<i> growing at a rate of an extra 10-20 as I watched (so some emitters must have still been inworld) entries for assets that

</I>&gt;<i> I am also unsure if I can simply delete the assets for this &quot;CreatorID&quot; or if that would mess everything up.
</I>
You should be able simply to delete the assets if you can identify them.

But yes, this is absolutely a problem for hypergrid regions with wide-open build permissions and I'm not sure how one 
can resolve it other than by restricting build perms.

There are &quot;delete object owner ... &quot; and &quot;delete object creator ...&quot; in the OpenSimulator 0.7.6 console commands if you 
can identify the UUID used by the user.  I'm not sure what the easiest way to do this is for HG users currently or if 
some command needs to be added.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. When I deleted the initial objects (about 2,000) I found that the [HG ASSETSERVICE] return mechanism was still
</I>&gt;<i> running after 12 hours and had not finished sending them back.  Single objects being returned at a rate of one every 10
</I>&gt;<i> seconds or so!  So if hundred of thousands of objects across a big grid were returned this could run for days.  That is
</I>&gt;<i> not a scalable mechanism. I have already reported that on Mantis as <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=6899">http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=6899</A>
