<PRE>No, they probably would not have been returned.  I had my region set for one
minute autoreturn, but he was able somehow to circumvent that.  The objects
were not at region boundaries, I assume because I am using ODE.  Most
appeared to be physical objects that clustered in a ravine, and several were
in fixed locations well within the region.  I was able to get rid of all of
them using About Land, but it took a while for them all to vanish.

For me, the biggest problem was that they completely immobilized the region,
preventing entry into it and blocking my users from reaching my HyperGrid
teleporters.

My question is, how can we prevent griefers like him from circumventing
object autoreturn?  Is there a configuration setting that I'm overlooking?
