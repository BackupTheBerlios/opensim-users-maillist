<PRE>
&gt;<i>From: Mister Blue &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/opensim-users">misterblue at misterblue.com</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>If the object was moved into the region on crossing failure, you'd end up
</I>&gt;<i>with exactly the same picture (lots of objects piled up at the region
</I>&gt;<i>border) but the objects would be just inside the region rather than just
</I>&gt;<i>outside. That seems like a small and un-useful change from what is
</I>&gt;<i>happening now.
</I>

Its definitely useful and I would suggest necessary.  If they were 
always kept in a legitimate region from 0.000 to 255.999 then normal 
region and land plot tools and autoreturn policies would 
apply.  Currently they are avoided by this exploit which is being 
taken advantage of by griefers.

Currently the objects end up in limbo... and have to be dealt with by 
someone who can access a region console... so a &quot;normal&quot; land owner 
or region/state manager cannot use the tools available to them via 
viewers to tidy up, return objects and stop scripts.

A serious problem also seems to be that the data bases grow 
enormously and are not garbage collected when the in world items are 
deleted, then &quot;assets&quot; table seems to remain populated.
