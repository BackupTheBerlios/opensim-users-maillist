<PRE>Hi all,

Thanks to everyone who let me know FleepGrid was hit again by this fellow.
 He's been a recurring thorn for years now, but fortunately it's pretty
easy to clean up.

IMO, turning off public build is not a solution, it's capitulation to the
griefer, and I won't do it.  I want visitors to be able to open packages,
play with what they find in my grid, and contribute to the space.  The
ability to change the world in real time is what sets Opensim apart from
other platforms, why would I turn off its best feature for the hundreds of
perfectly well-meaning visitors to my grid just to stop one occasional jerk?

People used to say the same thing in Second Life - turn off public build,
set auto return, lock it down!  Well geez, when you do that, you miss all
the wonderful and creative things people do when they have the opportunity
to contribute.  We successfully ran a mainland community with public build
and no autoreturn for years and years in Second Life, at the height of the
hype and griefer cycle, so I know it can be done.  Yes it takes a little
more attention and care to clean up occasional messes, but the benefits far
outweigh the costs in that people can actually use and enjoy the space,
which for me is the whole point of having a grid in the first place.

Having said that, more or better tools to clean up after griefers would be
great, especially if they could be worked into the viewer.  I'd love to be
able to find a griefer object, profile the object creator in the viewer,
and then click a button to delete all their crap off the whole grid - and
give that permission to others, for example - instead of having to muck
around on the console or database.  It would need a good &quot;Are you REALLY
SURE?!&quot; safety check, but it would be handy for the occasional griefer who
does pop up now and then.
