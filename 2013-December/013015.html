I see another possibility : rezing a box with a huge inventory. The 
HG transfer may end well after the visitor has left.

There are few ways to create assets programmatically : 
osMakeNotecard, osDrawImage , osSetDynamicTextureData and 
derivatives, osNpcSaveAppearance. Not sure our spammer is smart 
enough to write a database-spamming script, since he doesn't know how 
to do auto-reps (the spheres i've seen on Fleep's grid were not 
scripted).
