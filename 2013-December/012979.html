<PRE>I have had a visitor too: Jack.Marioline @sanctuary.homelinux.org Maandag 16, 2013 om: 20:03:23
As far as I could see he did no harm

The user Jack Marioline, along with a few aliases, is an infamous hypergridding griefer.  We've enjoyed his company at Littlefield Grid, at least for a few minutes.  In fact, this wiki page specifically addresses how to get rid of him:

<A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Banning_Foreign_Users_in_Hypergrid">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Banning_Foreign_Users_in_Hypergrid</A>

As for the objects, I believe if objects are not in the 256x256m are of a region then they will not be autoreturned.  However, objects are easily placed offsim.  The best way to get rid of them is to do a 'delete object outside'.

After banning him by name and MAC, I would also suggest banning the Vodafone Italy netblock.  Problem solved.

  I have an annoying person

  who arrived by Hypergrid on Openvue grid and created objects that seem to be right at the edge of each region...  their positions show as X= 257.62491 for example which I would think is not permitted. So he must be using an exploit.

  This means the objects are also not respecting the auto-return setting (5 minutes) or shwoign in about land so cannot easily be returned or deleted.

  Anyone seen this silly person around (2 day old avatar so I guess its someone creating new avatars as they get banned) and why does this exploit work?
