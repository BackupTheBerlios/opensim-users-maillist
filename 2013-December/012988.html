<PRE>There seem to be a number of levels to this issue... and I wonder if 
any need to be put in as Mantis issues.. maybe the devs can comment...

1. The (physical I believe) objects would have been autoreturned 
automatically... but all ended up clustered around the edge of my 
regions... at illegal positions (X=257 or Y=257 often).  Hence they 
did not show as objects in the region list but WERE included in the 
count of objects in the object count for the region.  I was able to 
use &quot;delete object outside&quot; to get rid of these objects as others 
suggested.  But this is a fundamental weakness of OpenSim that is 
obviously being exploited.

2. When I thought I had tidied this all up, I found my grid data base 
had grown 50% (that means many extra GB of assets as each was defined 
by a &quot;Blob&quot;) and the MySQL assets table still had 8000+ of the 
griefers objects in it, and was still growing at a rate of an extra 
10-20 as I watched (so some emitters must have still been inworld) 
entries for assets that were not inworld... though I had deleted and 
returned them.  I assume this is a garbage collection issue.  But it 
meant that anyone could effectively ruin the asset server for a tidy 
grid. Imaging if that were done on every OSGrid region!  I am also 
unsure if I can simply delete the assets for this &quot;CreatorID&quot; or if 
that would mess everything up.

3. When I deleted the initial objects (about 2,000) I found that the 
[HG ASSETSERVICE] return mechanism was still running after 12 hours 
and had not finished sending them back.  Single objects being 
returned at a rate of one every 10 seconds or so!  So if hundred of 
thousands of objects across a big grid were returned this could run 
for days.  That is not a scalable mechanism. I have already reported 
that on Mantis as <A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=6899">http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=6899</A>
