<PRE>A couple of days ago, I noticed he'd been in my grid and I added him to 
my estate ban list. That I could do that, should have been a clue to me 
that he had created a local account, but it didn't (I plead the fact 
that I've been sick for three weeks). Apparently he didn't like that, as 
he created that &quot;Pork Marioline&quot; account the next day. I just logged 
into my grid and I see that he has used that to take his anger out upon 
me and I now have thousands of objects to clean up.

Sigh.
